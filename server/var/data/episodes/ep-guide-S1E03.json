Art is a lie that makes us realize truth.\" From painting and poetry, symphonies and sculpture the arts bring beauty and illumination to some, confusion and frustration to others. But what is art?

Do they still make us realize the truth, or are they increasingly rarified and obsolete in this digital and disposable age?",
