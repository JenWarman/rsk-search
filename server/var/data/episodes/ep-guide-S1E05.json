        "content": "\"To be born English, is to win first prize in the lottery of life.\" So said Cecil Rhodes, one of the grandfathers of British Imperialism. At it's height, the British Empire ruled over one quarter of the World's population. And consequently exported Englishness to the furthest reaches of the globe. But what is Englishness? Is it stiff upper lips and fair play? Village greens and tea and crumpets? And who are the English? Are we defined by a shared heritage, a common set of beliefs, by the language of Shakespeare? Or in a multicultural modern age, when more languages are spoken in England than in any other country in Europe, do we need to develop a new view of what it means to be English? To discuss and define the nature and characteristics of the English, I'm joined by Stephen Merchant, graduate of the University of Warwick, and award winning writer.",
