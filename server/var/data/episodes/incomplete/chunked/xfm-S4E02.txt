Don't trust what they say. But one of them have we got any respect for anyone in the world get back to you Pete in tooting now again, I think this is nonsense.

What does well, they didn't expect to be stitched him up the need to the Romans to need Unis to need it for 40 piece to Silver summer, and I'm not big on the Bible but apparently incidentally if you like us to a stitch-up any kind of the size four pieces of silver just get in touch a tree Xfm.\n#OFFSET: 1247\nUnknown:  Willing to do that for you as well. But that's the last one what explanation there's another one here, which is again, I don't believe this for a moment. It says here Ginger people get a lot of stick because in a in Elizabethan times people with ginger hair were told that their mother had slept with the devil and that was why their hair brush their hair was Ginger. So there's two options. Maybe if you've got some more you can anymore spurious thoughts then get in touch 8 3 XF and but yeah, I don't know they might be treated both of those.
