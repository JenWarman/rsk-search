Yeah. I'm reporting this completely pointless, but\n#OFFSET: 90\nUnknown:  Not dissimilar to this show I imagine in terms of the number of listeners. Yeah, but I wasn't saying what's the chances of people having the this frequency on point of so, it's probably about the same. Yeah, you know what it reminds me of when I was when I was young. I wanted to get into radio as exciting video and I was just sort of in my identity 11 or 12, my friend and I we got a little mixing deck and used to host her own radio show but in from his bedroom, we don't have a transmitter. So we put some speakers in his front garden in some bushes and so broadcast it to people who are poor who have again probably over the\n#OFFSET: 120\nUnknown:  more listeners than this show almost certainly that yeah. I love your idea. We never have was hoping that maybe some girls would just come by and just let it sit and listen. These guys are great. I don't know any signs of coming from it seems to be that bush but or Noel Edmonds, you know an ongoing who are these guys so yeah, can you get one of those and they stand in for me when I got over there?

I don't know it's weird innit but why would you want to hold in your body there? It's quite pulling something out or like putting something out your body. It's don't know but it's not you watch one program recommended to you by Carl you've turned into Carl. You want a hole in your body know it was it was like seeing her like squeezing a really good sort of like spot. I mean, I'm sweet spots for ages and I'd ever had spots, but maybe that's it. I didn't have spot.\n#OFFSET: 346\nUnknown:  That's right. And I always thought that'd be nice reason the spot. I don't know what you're talking about growing hair. That's good.

Yeah, and yeah, like really in the cards like a bit of wax like a black putting a little candle and I love that. What? Yeah when because I've got no not much hair on my head no night it sort of grows thicker on my face.\n#OFFSET: 376\nUnknown:  Not true - oh my God. Yeah, my doors not to baby go on no evidence for that just made it up. So it goes sort of thicker on the neck on that and now and again I'll see you like something that's like a twig right? It's yeah really thick. Yeah, you think that and if you think I'm gonna have that and you work it and then when you get older it, it's brilliant. It's like pulling out it's fantastic. It's waxy and Builder and it pulls out and it's stretchy. Just getting it leaves a hole. I just realized why we talk about Chinese people monkeys engage every week.

They still don't really get it. I watched it and you see like The Fat Fish in that and you go it's not well, but I don't understand we'll all it does is it has to get into a bird because it asked her to breathe to lights eggs. It has to have a rise of body temperature. So as to the fish is cold-blooded. So that's it into a bird which is warm-blooded. There's lots of things if there's certain things why why is it doing that because it needs a needs to the temperature.\n#OFFSET: 467\nUnknown:  Needs that the heat energy to put it for its reaction.
