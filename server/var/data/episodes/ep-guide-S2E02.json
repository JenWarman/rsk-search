A seemingly simple concept, but the realities of making those good laws and enforcing them have troubled society since time immemorial. From community service to capital punishment, everyone has a view on how we protect the innocent and punish the guilty. Is one man's law another man's tyranny? Is justice available to all? Does prison work? Should we lock up law breakers and throw away the key? Or does that fail to address the root causes of crime? To discuss these questions and more, I'm joined by Stephen Merchant, award winning writer and graduate of the University of Warwick.",

But um, this time I was given a security and he came in a suit. He was about 30, he looked quite unassuming. I thought he was from a, just a security firm and there was a couple of them and uh, first of all, they were talking to each other and I thought, \"Well, the stakes are higher here, I don't know why.\" And uh, they drove us to the hotel and there was  uh, loads of people going into the hotel. I mean, much bigger stars than me, you know? There was Ed Norton and- and George Clooney and they were going in and out. And he goes, \"I- we can go past these.\" And he called ahead and he knew everyone, he just knew everyone. And we went down in the car park. We were met by another security guard in the hotel that let us go past everyone. I mean, Clooney's having to queue up and sign. I'm thinking, \"This is weird.\" And I was feeling bit guilty because I was there to promote the film and I think, \"This security guard is so good, I'm never going to ever have to bump into anyone.\" It was amazing.",
