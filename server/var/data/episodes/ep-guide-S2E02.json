A seemingly simple concept, but the realities of making those good laws and enforcing them have troubled society since time immemorial. From community service to capital punishment, everyone has a view on how we protect the innocent and punish the guilty. Is one man's law another man's tyranny? Is justice available to all? Does prison work? Should we lock up law breakers and throw away the key? Or does that fail to address the root causes of crime? To discuss these questions and more, I'm joined by Stephen Merchant, award winning writer and graduate of the University of Warwick.",

I didn't have to go to court, but I had to meet with the CID for all the details and take that - it wasn't me - and all that. So the funny thing was, I'm there with the CID man and I said, well, how did they think they were going to get away with it? And they said, well, they turn up with them a fake passport of yours, show the ID, and I walk away. I went \"right, okay\". And they said \"they get a passport from either a dead man or they steal one and they replace it with your details and your picture\". And the CID man started smirking. The picture they used was this one. And he showed me this fake passport. And I'll tell you what, I was laughing. Then he started chuckling and we laughed about ten minutes, because all they did was, they cut out the picture on the first series of The Office from the DVD. So it's a picture of David Brent sitting behind the desk with that little smug look on his face. That's my passport in this thing. So, I mean, they might have got caught. Anyway.",

And uh, I've had security before, often have security, they just sort of get you in and out of the car and- usually just to control sort of autograph hunters and things and... But um, this time I was given a security and he came in a suit. He was about 30, he looked quite unassuming. I thought he was from a, just a security firm and there was a couple of them and uh, first of all, they were talking to each other and I thought, \"Well, the stakes are higher here, I don't know why.\" And uh, they drove us to the hotel and there was  uh, loads of people going into the hotel. I mean, much bigger stars than me, you know? There was Ed Norton and- and George Clooney and they were going in and out. And he goes, \"I- we can go past these.\" And he called ahead and he knew everyone, he just knew everyone. And we went down in the car park. We were met by another security guard in the hotel that let us go past everyone. I mean, Clooney's having to queue up and sign. I'm thinking, \"This is weird.\" And I was feeling bit guilty because I was there to promote the film and I think, \"This security guard is so good, I'm never going to ever have to bump into anyone.\" It was amazing.",

And then um, I found out I had a gun. He said, \"I can't come in the airport with you, I can't take my gun.\" So... he's armed. So I've got a security who's LAPD, who's- who's armed. And I'm fascinated now, I'm fascinated. This man is walking around with me with a little earpiece, talking to everyone, he seems to know everyone, and he's got a gun. I think, \"This is amazing.\" Then one night he said, uh, he dropped me off at the hotel and he said, \"Uh, I've actually been called. I've got to go on a mission. They need my help.\" I said, \"What is it?\" He said, \"It's a hostage situation,\" he said, \"And I'm, I'm also SWAT.\" So now I'm just- this is amazing. He's now officially the coolest man I've ever met in my life. So he goes off. Then I'm thinking and I'm worried about him. And I was talking to Jane, I was thinking, \"Wow, he does this to get some extra cash, he's risking his life, and now he's going to a hostage situation.\" And I was thinking, \"Oh God, it's just- he's just a silent hero.\"",
