  "text": "Out of time on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me is Steve Merchant and Kyle Pilkington. I really like that blur track. I think it's the best thing they've ever done. Blimey. So strong words. They can quote me on that if they want. On their. One of their albums. If they wanted. Well, listen, you're lucky I'm here, Steve, okay? You can see, you know, something's happened. I've done my back in again, right? I've got a special chair in here. I mean, agony. And I want the strongest painkillers I can get. I feel a bit. Carl. I had to call Karl up today and say, look, I don't know if I can make it in. Can you come and get me? He came over to my house. We got in a cab and he got me here, right? While he was around my house, Jane showed him sort of camcorder footage of how I actually did it, of how. You hurt your back. And I wanted Carl to tell you because I was actually worried that if I didn't turn up, what you'd say to me. Yes. What was I doing, Carl? Right, so I get round to his place, right? Says, right, play on the video, right? Have you ever seen a gorilla having a fight? I think I have, yeah. Yeah, it was like that. Him and his mate around his place last night decided to sort of have a bit of a wrestle. Yes. It went on. I mean, how much footage? Honestly, it was like a scene from women in love. We had about five fights. We had to stop at one point because his arm was bleeding. He'd had about five fights. Yeah, well, we were wrestling. We were doing wrestling, right, in the lounge. Yeah, on our knees. And then sort of like to, you know. And I kept. I kept winning with an arm lock, right. And then the last time he sort of threw me and my back. And my back was done and I was, you know, it was Ian Morris. Yes, it was. You know, isn't he a commissioning editor of comedy at Channel four? And the funny thing was that we'd had lots and lots of wine and we weren't. You surprised me. Yeah, right. Come on, come on, come on. I filmed this. And the time we filmed, I said, film this, and went. And I took my shirt off. It's right there. You can just hit slapping. Why can I just ask, though? I mean, it's a Friday night, you know, you had a couple of drinks, some intellectual conversation. How does it get round to. Do you fancy wrestling me? Well, and having it filmed well, it was on the couch, but I kept sticking my socks in his face to annoy him. Right? And then he hit me on the shin and I got sharp shins and it hurt and I was going to smack your face. And he's done kickboxing and it's that thing like you sort of joke. And they go, come on then. Yeah. And you start. Have you ever seen the thing when Jack Osborne fights that skater dude? No. On the Osborne, I was very much the Jack Osborne figure. Right? Yeah. The fat bloated guy just killed a rehab. I'll tell you what it was like, Steve. Have you ever seen like the David Attenborough stuff? Like, Tiger will be ripping a deer's head off and you think, why doesn't the camera crew stop it? Yeah. So what you're thinking, why was James. Why not stepping in and intervening? Yeah. And the thing is, she said, right, you've seen enough. I mean, stopped it. So I don't know how much footage you got. Because your lounge is not huge and there's not much space between the back of the sofa and the table. I don't need. No, it was just. It was just a pain or a submission. So it was. It was all over with, like one of us throwing the other on the back. And how does it. I mean, how do you start with the rest of my show? You both stood up or, you know. On your knees and you sort of like go together like ratting steel. Yeah. Like a giant walrus. It's not gay. Play a record. Can we put that online? Can we get that on the web? That I would love to say. Better. Roger Stewart. Yeah. Stuart may indeed. You need to say no more. If people don't know what it is from that information. Gervais merchant pil. Exactly. All right. Exactly, Rick. I was out last night in the crouch end area and I passed her. I always. Things upset me like this. It was a restaurant. It was a little french restaurant, but you barely noticed it. You walked past, it was like a row of houses and a little french restaurant there, open. It was kind of summery bistro. No one in there, Rick. It would be ten to ten, I'm thinking, if no one's in there, ten to ten on a Friday evening, it's doomed. And it really upset me. It genuinely upset me because I always think about the little french guy there. You know, he's put all his money into that. He's convinced his wife to do it. Yeah. You know, she's not convinced, but she's a great cook. Eve exactly. And it's already going down the pan. Do you know why? You don't want french food in the hot summers night. You want mexican food. Indeed. Some kind of toughest. Exactly. But then I was, because we were just discussing other things that upset us. And my glimpse. War. Well, true, obviously. War. I mean, obviously I started with war, planning famine, disease, SARS, that sort of thing. And then, then I came down the list to worried about people who manufacture fax machines. Why? Because technology. Well, I mean, if you want to say you're making fax machines, you're a little company. You make fax machines. You know what a little company. All right, you're making fax machines. Are you allowed to use email? What? Like if you work for coke, you're not allowed to drink Pepsi. It just seems like I'm, I'm assuming the fax machine sales are plummeting. Now the thing is, right, isn't it? Now I haven't got a fax machine. You're right, I got email, but I much prefer a fax because you get it, it comes out the other. It comes out the other side. Yeah, but I mean, it is what they've sent. That's what's great about a fact. But you can print off your email, can't you? And then you've got it, a hard copy. Wow. You know, I don't look at the emails. The fax comes out, it's there it goes. It's like someone putting a little postnar on your face. Do you know? I mean, you go, oh, yeah, I'll read that. Yeah. Whereas the email. You got email. Yeah. No, but what worries me is where the facts, I'm assuming fax machines are just, I mean, I don't know if there's anyone listening who works maybe for a fax machine. 700, 801, two, three, four. If you're in the fax industry, give us a call. Tell us, you know, what sort of, sort of figures. Yeah, you know, exactly. Yeah. We want to go down 17% in the southwest. Exactly. Those are the stats. But you got, have you got fax machines yet in the north, Carla? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you're loving it and. Yeah, I like getting letters. Well, no one. You like getting a scroll from a man on a horse. Yeah. When do you get letters? My mum still sends me the odd letter. Sure. Even though I call, she'll still, she likes sitting down at a table. And you know what, you call and. Ask the questions, there's no reply. And then you get a letter a day later. Going, question one. Yes, I am. Well, question two. Yes. Your father's. Well, yeah. Oh, it's nice, though, isn't it? Yeah, that is nice. It's nice to receive a letter. Yeah, it's always nice to receive a. Letter, particularly if, like, you know, you're on a sort of expedition. Yeah. What does annoy me, though? You. You were looking at him the other day, you know, you were talking about the pictures on. And postcards. Yes. Don't like them. You don't like. You don't like postcards? No, they annoy me. Just. Just because it's never anything of any interest. And the fact that even though it's been sent to you, you're the last one to read it. Whenever I used to see my mama postcard every day, every time I send her on, I'd horrify her by putting on it. Having a lovely time. Does that pig of a postman still. Read all your letters? And she'd just be horrified, just be terrified. He looked. It's just what worries me. I've always assumed that people would read a postcard. If I was a postman, I would definitely read about every single postcard. So if you're on holiday, what do you mean? You wouldn't have a lot of time left if you read every postcard? No, but as you were posting, as you're posting through the letterbox, you'd have a quick look, wouldn't you? See what they were up to. Because that's why I never used to write anything of any interest on a postcard, because I didn't want to, you know, I didn't want anyone to sort of know what I was up to. Let's say I was on a bawdy lads holiday. Yeah. I just write sun, you know, nice, sunny, you know, got myself a lovely pair of shorts. So, you know, I'd keep the truth, Rick. Yeah. When I got home. Well, he's looking forward to it on holiday now, Carl, because he's got some prescription lens sunglasses. We're to be talking about that after the break. Look forward to that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. An amusing story about a man wearing glasses. Oh, the darkness growing on me. It certainly is. 104.9. Love those boys. Keep the guitar riffs up, lads. I'm Ricky Deveighs. With me, Steve Murcho. It's good to see that your back pain has not impaired your djing abilities. Yeah, I know, I know. Well, I'm a professional. I'm a professional soldier at all. Yeah, put the glasses on for Kyle. Well, see now, because I wear glasses normally, I've always had problems with glasses. The thing about glasses is it stops you from doing so many things, and you may not realize, if you're a non glasses wearer, certain things that you can never do. Like, for instance, I have never been able to volleyball, go into the mosh pit, gig, carried above everyone on their hands, because I knew someone would just need to. You can see from the back. That's the good thing about you can actually sound. Being able to at least jump on the stage and do a stage dive and all the rest of it. So that's one of the things I've missed out on. Missed out on, you know, sport, really, because lots like boxing, for instance, I could never do. I never do boxing, never do wrestling. So our big championship showdown is not going to happen. We'd probably be the same weight category. Well, possibly. I remember when I first got glasses, I only had to wear them occasionally. I think I was. It meant I couldn't see things a long way away. And also I got them. But I was at school and I was a bit self conscious. Didn't want to really tell anyone I had glasses. I just. I didn't reveal to anyone I was wearing them. So I used to go into a class. I remember being in science, and we always sat in the same spot, and I was sat right at the back and I couldn't see what was on the blackboard, but I didn't want to start. I don't want to put my glasses on because I didn't want people to know I had glasses. So I couldn't see what was being written on the board. You have to copy stuff down from the board. Science equations, things like that. I had no idea. So I'd have to try and copy off someone next to me. But that wasn't always possible because I had to do it surreptitiously. So what I took to doing was sharpening my pencil every sort of 35 seconds, going up, memorizing what was on the board. And I got a d in science. Oh, that's awful, though. It's a big. It's a tough thing, glasses, when you. First start wearing a few, it was education versus vanity. Yeah, it's terrible, isn't it? And now he's think. He thinks, well, he's sorting out his hair. You see his stylish hair, because when I met him, it was like, I mean, words will gummy. He won't mind me saying that. Yeah, his glasses were, I mean, idiotic when I met him. And he's got some stylish glasses now. So he sorted down. Yeah, he's closed. He's quite a fashionable bloke and when I first met him. So it's step by step. And with these, I think you'll agree. Pop them on, Steve. Well, you know, I imagine him in the. On the beach. Close your eyes, Carl. Are they closed? I can't see. I've taken my glasses off. So that's the weird thing as well in it. There you go. What are you laughing at? Look. What you laughing at, Carl? There's nothing funny about those. Stop smirking. I can see, Fliv. You can see. They're not real sunglasses, they're prescription lenses. So we can see you now. You see, I never knew you had to do that. Sunglasses, I didn't think you had to have that. Right. Yeah. When it's bright outside, people who wear glasses don't need to wear them. So they're. They're looking cool, but they're bumping into stuff. But if your eyes aren't that good, then the sun shouldn't be bothering them. No. I always wondered about Roy Orbison. Why was he doing that? What? Roy Orbison always had shades on, didn't he? And he was blind and stuff. It's like, well, what's the point of that? Well, because I don't, I don't. I mean, I don't. I'm guessing. Well, I don't even want to. I don't know, talking about. It's. Roy Olsen was blind, wasn't he? Yeah. Was he? I thought he just had very, very bad vision. No, he was a blind fellow. I don't think he was blind. Was he not? No. I think. I don't know what this conversation is anymore. No. Well, once again we've introduced Carl into the equation. It's just gone off on a completely bizarre tangent. When I went, he went over and pick up my description lenses, and he went, we had to wait and the bloke came, he said, who's it for? Oh, yeah, Mister Merchant, here they are. And as he was getting out to try and embarrass Steve, I went to him. They are the exact ones that Keanu Reeves uses in the matrix, aren't they? What? I went, I'm joking, I'm joking. But tell you what frustrates me. Can I just say, as a glasses wearer, this is just a note to everyone out there who isn't a glasses wearer. When people ask constantly to try on your glasses, can I try on your glasses? And they try them on and they always say the same thing. Oh, I can't see a thing. What were you expecting, x ray vision? No. Yeah, I know. Don't ask where. You don't want people asking to try. Realize that. What? Going, oh, God, your eyesight's bad. Yeah. It's not like going, you know, I mean, it's not like saying, let's have a go with your calipers. Right. And popping them on and going, you. Can'T walk very well, isn't it? Well, yeah, but it's. It's a. It's one that doesn't impair that much. It's an inconvenience that you maybe have to put glasses on all the time. No, but, but it's not. Yeah, but you're, you're not, you're not, um, uh, what's. What's your vision? It's just blurred. Is it? No, I can't see anything. It's really bad. Is it really bad? Yeah. If I take my glasses off, you are just a blur. I see now. I can see nothing. It's just. Just a couple of bald heads. And I know only one of you is bald. So you're looking at Carl twice. Yeah, exactly. All right, what's your vision? 2020. Well, there you go. That's Steve's eyes on XFM next week. Ricky's knees. Yeah. Now listen, I want to mention this. This is from this new Morrissey compilation. It's a new series. I'm assuming a number of different rock stars are going to do it. It's called under the influence. And various rock stars get to choose, obviously, songs which they grew up listening to and have influenced them. And this is from Morrissey. He's the first person to do it. And there's some stuff on there which is a bit old and a bit odd born. There's some stuff which is good. And there's a Ramones on there and Nico and Patty Smith. But this is one of them, obviously. Famously, Morrissey was a member. He was. I think he was the president of the New York Dolls fan Club in England. And this is from there. This is trash, the New York dolls trash from this new compilation under the influence, compiled by Morrissey. Are they the original punk band? At zero eight, 7801. Two, three, four. We don't want your calls, everyone. Don't call in. Don't call in, please. We're not interested. No point. Rick, it's 01:30 yeah, adverts. Yeah, Coldplay and the scientists on XFM 104.9. Riggagemay Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. We saw an interesting sight on the way, didn't we, Steve? Yeah, we can't. When we came in yesterday to play. On the show, to plan the show. Yeah. We actually annoyed Carl for half hour and left. But a bloke with a completely tattooed. Face, I don't know what stage you are in, you know what stage you're at in your life when tattooing your own face. This wasn't sort of like, you know, tribal or religion. It was a bloke just had an sort of tattoo on his forehead and around his eyes, professionally done. It looked quite old. So I don't know if. I don't know if tattoos do that now. I think they've probably got to watch themselves, but I just think there's not. Rules about what you can tattoo. I'm assuming if you're a tattooist, you can do what you want, you can tattoo anything. I wouldn't have thought. There's probably some comeback, isn't there? I mean, I certainly, you know, I think they've got to be so. But I think you got to be over 21. I don't know, over something. And I wouldn't have thought many tattoos would tattoo someone's face, would they? Well, I don't have you, Methodist, somebody. I don't want to slag him off, but they are like, you know, do I? They're big. Well, exactly. And they love needles. A lot of them are big, but. They do seem like they live in a periphery of society a lot. But I wouldn't, I wouldn't. I just wouldn't tattoo someone's face. Do you know, I mean, wrestle a. Man to the ground and then hurt your back. No, I know. Does everyone ever regret it? I mean. I mean, I'm sure some people regret a tattoo. Whenever someone shows me a tattoo, I go, that's brilliant, because I can't bear to go, that's rubbish. Yeah, yeah. I just think that because they can't change it, there's no point. Yeah. What do you think? I go, it's brilliant. What I read in the paper, was it a man or a woman who had David? Betty just had Beckham on their arm, just not a picture of him. But the word Beckham tattooed on their arm spelt wrong. Oh, they missed out the k. Or maybe they missed out the c. So it was b e k a m. No, anyway, it was spelled wrong. I mean. Oh, I mean, firstly, why do you just have the name of David Beckham on your arm? Home tattoos are the best though, that's done with a pin and a link in prison skins. Yeah. It's all wonky because they've done it in a mirror. Yeah. What does that say? We'll read it to knuck. Yeah. In the mirror. Profanity. Yeah. Have you. Would you ever toy with a tattoo, Carl, or something? I've told you about me, my uncle Stan before. Tattoo Stan. No, he's just covered in them. It just looks a mess. Do you know? I mean, you can be wearing the best suit in the world, but you still look a scruff. Sure, yeah. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Once you have it done. Well, no, some tattoos, you know, can be quite tasteful. No, no, he was covered. It was like, you know, cut here on his neck. It's just. Yeah, a mess. And he did a lot of his own. I've told you about him before. Have you? I don't remember. Yeah, because I was saying, if you're going to do your own, at least make sure you're a good drawer. Yes. It was just what he thought. Had he done. He sort of doodled snakes around. Yeah. All these kids names on his arms and it's like, can't you remember him? Yeah. He might have had a lot. No, he did, yeah. And do you remember, even from a young age, thinking, that looks rubbish. Yeah. Yeah. And, I mean, it would probably be about 60 now. I'd love to see what he looks like. Yeah. Just look at this. There was another. There was a story the other day in one of the magazines that I read about this. This fella who had a. Well, this would be bizarre. Or 14 times. Then. One of the magazines you read. Yeah. So it's gonna be the spectator. No. This fella had a big eagle put on his back. Yeah. With a snake sort of covering it. And so such rubbish, isn't it, this guy, symbols of sort of lord of the rings. Yeah. Snake and an eagle. Yeah. A large breasted vampire woman riding a dragon. Yeah. Yeah. That's always a good one. But, you know, this fella had that and he had it in his will that when he dies, he wanted his son to have the skin taken off. Oh, God. I'm putting a. Putting, like a little frame. Oh. Oh, God, that's. That's horrific. What's that? That's my dad's back. Yeah. Oh, are you sure? God, no, no, because I was. I read it and kind of thought started having sort of memories of aunt Inora again. Yeah. Because she used to always, like, now. Anti Nora is the woman for five minutes. Sure. Yeah. But she also. She used to say, carl, rub me back. And with her being quite old, it was also moldy and watery. It was moldy. Moly. Moly. Right. And what you do. I didn't like it. I hated it. It was reading a braille book. Yeah. It was like putting your hand in a load of cocoa pops. Oh, dear. Oh, really big. And I just thought framing hers would be sort of 3d ish. Of the moon. Did you r text that wall. Any piece of your body car? Disgusting. Putting your hand into. Is she the one with the split tennis ball when she wasn't wearing. Hello. Let's not discuss the tennis ball. Okay, so she used to get you to sort of knead her dough on. Her back. With her. With her dress, whatever. She wore those sort of squid looking things that. Oh, sorry, sorry. What? What? Those squid looking eyes aren't in. Nora covered in octopuses. What you talking about? What do you mean? It's like a nightgown type thing. What's squid got to do with it? Because he sort of looked like a squid around the edge. Oh, I know. Frilly things. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And she just said, oh, just. Oh, I'm aching there. She was never. Well, she was never. Do you know what I mean? She's always had something wrong with her. I don't. I don't ask her, you know, she's not going to be all right. Did she have wind when you were sort of neat? It must be like playing an accordion. Yeah. Get little tunebuilds. Who's your auntie with the tattoos? That's Hazel. Oh, yeah. Sleeve that. Why? What have I come across there? What's up with Andy Hazel? What's up with Andy Hazel? There's nothing wrong with it. Why? Just a. What? Just a lesbian. Which is nothing wrong with that. Well, no, but you've made it sound like there is now. Why not wanting to say it? My aunt is a lesbian. I know what you're saying, though. I know what you're getting at. Just because I call her Uncle Hazel. Play a record. He's from Manchester. Please, please forgive him. Lizzie, don't believe a word. XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Jones. With me, Steve Merchant, Pilkington. Email here from Chris. He said you met a girl in Australia whose boyfriend tattooed her arm with the word psycho, except the spelling was wrong and she ended up scarred for life with the word fizzco. Fizco. B h y s c o. If you're going out today to get a tattoo, they're tattooists. English is probably not their speciality, so be careful. Write it down for the nice. I've seen some of these boys, they're big. Big. No. If they're willing to stick lumps of metal through their faces, what are they gonna do to you? Well, yeah, indeed. So, yeah, Steve. Sorry, talking. You say, I have a weird problem with the piercing as well because, I mean, the earrings, that makes sense idea inside. But did you. Yeah. And he's scared everything. Yeah, I was about 18, I took two in one and they did it. Right. And he's went. And I went, all right. I went, yeah. Oh, God. It's just, he just. It was like a staple gun. It's what do. Yeah, yeah, and, yeah, and it really hurt. I thought, well, I'm not doing that again. It hurts too much and it just throbbed. Were you still living with your parents at the time? No, I mean. What? No, I'm kind of oiki reading family. What would they have made of? Oh, well, they know I had them afterwards. Yeah. Oh, God, of course I did, yeah, yeah. Right. You ain't going eight like that. Oh, you'll get followed. Oh, look at you. Look at that. Yeah. That's disgusting. And I was. No one else knew. Roman said, bloody how. I thought I only had one girl. Which is the earring, because isn't it like one ear is for gay people and one is frustrated? Is that just a myth? I don't know, it might, yeah. There probably was sort of like signs for that. Yeah. It's like when you're growing up. I had loads, like, um, a white polar neck. Right. And a ring on your little finger. That means you're gay. Yeah, yeah. You can see him coming. In the left ear. I don't know where I am. That thing, that's the famous cover of boring Bruce Springsteen. Yeah. Where, you know, the handkerchief. Yeah. Even in the right hand pocket, dominant and was. Yeah. I don't know, but, you know, when. Where is this information? I wouldn't have known that. I might have gone around, you know, with, you know, if it was hot weather. Yeah. Something to mop my brow. I would have known that. Can't the gay people kind of notify? Can we have some kind of website or something? Do you still go to that pub with all those sort of like butch blokes with the moustaches and. Yeah, the cats. Great guy. A lot of them are firemen. A lot of them are like traffic cops. Great people, you know, I mean, you know, you're safe in there. There's no women. To having a great time with the lads. It's playing pool stripped to your waist. Yeah, yeah, I can talk. Oh, my back stall. Okay. Yeah, a little bit hip hop. It's nice to have occasional hip hop tune. Just keep it. You know, it's summer. Cruising around in your open top shed. Now, Steve, I see that it's a track by little Kim, but how are you pronouncing it? I'm pronouncing that correctly, lil Kim. Oh, no, t's involved. And it's the jump off, featuring Mister cheeks. I don't know why I find that funny, but Mister Cheeks is involved, if you can spot him. Good luck. I believe that's mister cheeks there. Just busted it on the mic. And that's called the jump off. Talking of cheeks, Carl, have we got another instalment of cheeky freak of the week this week? Yeah. Have we? Excellent. Look forward to that. Is there some monkey news? Goes without saying, of course. Really? That monkey news is safe, isn't it? It's not like you're always going home with monkey news. You know, it's there. Yeah, it's like songs of praise on a Sunday. When I came back, I've been on holiday for a week and I sort of sat in by the pool and stuff. And I sort of wrote about 40 minutes stand up with a new show. And I was going to call, I said, it's great when you get away. It's sort of like you relax and you just. You just think clearly, Ian. I know, I know, I know. He said I was away when I came up with rockbusters. Yeah, indeed. Absolutely. I was buzzing about writing 40 minutes of brand new stand up. He equated that to coming up with Rockbusters. Should I be insulted, Steve, or is rockbusters as good as everyone's saying it is? Is it the one good idea? Is it like EMC MC squared words to Einstein is to, you know, rockbusters is to Carl. What if I do this, Rick? What if we. If I played you some adverts right now and then we talk about it with some rockbusters? Yeah, you could. You could make the judgment yourself. Maybe I'll do rockbusters and show people how easy it is to do it wrong. Adverts, then. Rockbusters. And a cup of lovely coffee. Cup of coffee in the coffee. I want a cup of coffee. Placebo. This picture. Xfm. What's Carl doing? Was he rooting around now? But listen, while he's doing that, can I just say happy birthday from all rockbusters, aren't you? To Sharon. Her friend Terry said, play some placebo for Sharon. So happy birthday. That's done. Cross that off the list. Yeah. That's another thing we've got through today. Rockbusters, please. Do you want to look at the prizes? I'll have look at the prizes, see what people can win. It's an email only competition. Please remember that. All right, we've got the later with Jules Holland. Louder. DVD. There's stuff on there from the Cardigans. Rollins is on there. Mercury, Reverend, Sonic Youth, the Datsuns, Queensland Stone Age. They're all great bands, but I think they need a boogie woogie piano at the top of everything they do. Hopefully Jules Holland will have. Okay, good, good. Because there was something missing there on most of those tunes. Yeah. Current album from Goldfrap. That's there as well. What have we got this on DVD? The Life of mammals, the complete series of that. We've got the inspiral carpets again. A three CD set of the best of the inspiral carpets. I don't know how they've strung it over. Three CD. The best one hit wonders in the world ever and three CD set. I'm struggling. I'm assuming CD three is just the Corals album. Anyway, there's some good things that you've this week. All right? Cryptic, Cliff. Couple of initials and. And you sort that out. Right, first one. Doctor Fox on about that. We don't. We don't sound like proper presenters. It's mad. Go on, Carl. Right. The first one. A customer wanted some paint to darken up a room. Shop assistant knew what to do. Right. Customer wanted some paint to darken up a room. The shop assistant knew what to do. The initials there. CB. Right. CB. CB for the first one there. Right. Second one. It'd be all right if. If their heads weren't that big. Right? And again. It would be all right if their heads weren't that big. And that's SF. SF, yeah. And the last one. Yeah, go on. And the last one. Chanel. I've got another perfume out. N o. Right, Chanel. I've got another perfume out. Ricky. Doctor Vasex UK. Those prizes can be yours. More music, please. Better. Bob Marley. Any of these go annoy me. I've got to stare up. Brilliant. Are any of these clues go annoy me this week? They're all good. Are they really? Ricky Gervaise FM co dot UK. Bob Marley on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant. Karl Pilkin. Wait, did you get up today and just see the great weather and think, do you know what? I'd love to hear some. Stir it up from Bob Marley. Yeah, I did, actually. Well, I was gonna play it last, the week before last, before I went away, and we didn't have time, so. Well, we were crammed full of features like this one. Have we got a cheeky freak of the week? Do you want one? Yeah, I think we should have a jingle for this. Okay. Yeah, I've got a jingle. It's very similar to chimpanzee. Chimpanzee that. Well, let's hear it. Let's hear it. Okay. All cheeky freak of the week. Brilliant. Brilliant. Yeah. No, I think that's excellent. Freak of the week. You've spotted a freak where. This is where, somewhat, I think, offensively, you pick on someone who's. Who's not like other people and say it's your favorite freak of that week. I remember we had the woman whose legs look like the hind legs of a dog. We've had the little fella with the aging disease with a little edge playing the piano. That's. That was your favorite. I think that's your. Probably freak of the year, isn't it? It's a pretty good one. So what's this? Is it a man with a horrendous injury or is it a congenital birth defect or what? Yeah, but you put it like that and now it sounds like I'm being tight. Sounds like I'm being out of order. But I'm just giving him a mention. Just giving him a big shout out. There's quite a lot going on in the freak world. There always is. You've been visiting hospitals the last week, have you? When we were away? No, there was a. There was a thing on the website. This isn't even the one that I've picked, so. So this is just a bonus. This is a bonus. Please. Yeah, yeah. Go on in. This is a free freak. It's a fellow called the lobster man. The lobster man. Of course. Again, good name. You know what you're gonna get? Yeah. What are you gonna get? Some succulent meat. I like the idea. I like the idea that the vicar on the christening suggested that. I know. You wanna call him Mark. Can I make a suggestion? What's his name? Mark Michael Webster. Right. Um. Right, yeah. Have you thought about a nickname? Not really, no. Have you? Yeah. We don't want to talk about that because. Yeah, but it's quite deformed. It's like, you know, we can suggest. Lobster man, that's terrible, vicar. That is terrible, vicar. Then we're gonna see. This is what the sort of feature you come up with, Carl. So lobster man. There's probably people listening now with, you know, lobster feet, lobster hands. So squid boy. So, lobster man, what does. What does lobster man do? Does he fight crime? Not that much. They got into a bit of trouble. He was in a restaurant and this was years ago, by the way, and. Someone picked him to eat him. No, the waiter said, oh, you shouldn't be sat. He should be in me. Up my pants or something. Oh, dear. They had a fight. Got out of hand. Yeah. Got out claw and. Yeah. So that was. A waiter took the Mickey out of someone with. I'm assuming, is his hands look a bit like those of a lobster? Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's fused. So it's just like two big fingers. They're fused, I assume, probably in the womb. And they're just like. Instead of like five digits, they're fused and it. But he can pick stuff up, can he? Yeah. What does he pick up? He mainly eats crabs and jellyfish, doesn't he? Yeah. Yeah. So he was having a fight with the waiter. He snipped off his nose. He just held on to the waiters bib. Yeah. He was screaming, going, get him off me. Yeah. Does he eat other lobsters? Does he lobster? Or is it kind of. Would he feel bad about eating lobster? The little cheek of the freak that we've gone for anyway. The little freak of the week. Yeah, freak of the week. We've gone for this siamese lad. Okay. Right. Happened back in. You can't have a siamese lad, can you? All right, yeah. This siamese twins happen back in 1693. Oh, he's got a date. Blindness first. I never. Yeah. And all it was, he was. It was doing all right for himself. He used to go on there like those circus things he used to do there. Two people. You're talking about Carl. So we're going to him. All right, then. All right. They. They did this circus show, right. And everything's going well, you know, selling out the tents and stuff. People coming to see them. Yeah. He was doing all right for himselves. Yeah. Right. Before I said that, did you think a siamese twin was a man with two heads? Well, it can be. Can it? Depends. There is two people. They're conjoined. No, no, no, but it depends on it. The one that I showed you in that book that time was a fellow with two heads. No, it wasn't. That was. That was a stupid picture in one of your stupid books that he had a growth that looked a little bit like it had a face on it. It wasn't a man with two heads. You're the same sort of people who send good potato chips to Esther Anson and say, doesn't it look like Norman cook? Yeah. It's not two heads. We'll bend this feature. No, no, it's two people. They're two people. Conjoined twins. Right. So these. They just happen to have a similar taste in clothes. Okay. Anyway, so, yeah, they were doing all right and it all went wrong when he crossed the road. Got run over. The lad with two heads got run over. That's it. What? How is that. How is that cheeky freak of the week? Just because. Just because he got my interest and I kind of thought, why don't he just look both ways? I'm intrigued to know, why wasn't he looking both ways? I know how you. How you get run over. What was it? 1629. Yeah, well, it's horses and. Yeah. Oh, why wasn't he looking both ways? Carl. Carl Pilkington, you are a genius. Player record, you fool. Well done, Carl. More cheeky freak of the week next week. So what's going on? Universally speaking, red hot chili Peppers and XFM 104.9. So I've got a lot of rockbusters coming in. Yeah. All right. Actually, people actually seem at long last, to have tuned into your wavelength, Carl, which is, of course, 104.9. Yeah, very much. Exactly, yeah. Should we give the clues again briefly? We just haven't even. To be honest with you, that's not because we've already had a load of answers. You know, you didn't get it first time around, you don't deserve to win. We had an email saying, because I've got a bad back. Am I squeezing? Carl's a. Rob already had a little squeeze tonight about half hour ago, didn't I? You just gotta be careful because I don't. I don't any strain. So I say, keep still, whatever happens. And he's. You're right about there. Could I ever squeeze? You know, just as well you're not really kind of capable. Squeeze it, isn't he? I've never squeezed it once. Remember, sideways temples go quite hard, but not too hard. Yeah. Front to back, go as hard as you like, because that's never tried. You've got a bucket. He sorted it out. He says every Saturday. So it's the front of the back. Yeah. No, get round, get round. So you got. That's it right now. Usually use the thing not too hard at the front. No, really hard. Front and back. There you go. Yeah, you got the angle there. Oh, God. It's good fun. I know you like. It's great fun. Yeah, it's great. You know, there's a little bit of, you know, grip there with the short hair, but obviously not too much. There's not much up there up top. Goodnit. Yeah, I'll be doing that again next week. Do you know I got a form, right? You know I'm staff here, right? I'm right on the staff. On one of the staff. Got some internal mail the other day that you have to fill out about. If you die at work, who gets your money? He says, do you put yourself at any danger? What did you say? Well, I asked Susan, I said, does. That, you know, my leg lock round your ribs that time? And I had to, it was like, like a little alligator, like a python analogy, didn't I? You get quite some, you know, get a little bit of leverage. You can crush a man's ribs with you, with mighty legs. Oh. Something I want to ask you, Carl. I. There's that program on now, I figured what it's called, is it something like, guess who's coming to dinner does that. I did the non broadcast pilot for that. My mate was the, well, you know, the Phil, welcome. And the premise of it is that it's, it's one of those things about, you know, a conversation piece, the ultimate dinner party. I think you can have six, invite. Six guests, dead, alive, all fictional or fictional. Yeah. And, you know, you choose where you want it and. Yeah, and anyway, I was just intrigued to know what Carl's ultimate dinner party. Who would pop round any of your cheeky freaks? So what's this? I'm putting on a, an imaginary dinner. Party and Robinson's there. She's got to be there. I said, I didn't invite you. She said, well, I'm there anyway, so it was actually me and Robinson and six people. Yeah. And I chose people like heroes, like Muhammad Ali, Homer Simpson, stuff like, you know, James, Randy. Yeah. So you could use it, anyone, living or otherwise. Would it, would it, would it look like a circus from the 18th century? I'd have a love, like a few freaks in there. Like what? Who would you have? Well, the first person I'd have is probably, probably have Elvis. I had Elvis. I chose Elvis. Why would you have Elvis? It's just. Good one. It was good that what he did. But once you'd said that to him. What would the rest of singers? A song. Right. So you make him single song. Yeah. The entertainment for the night when he's not on the stage performing. I probably have the Elephant man there. So. John Merrick. Yeah. Elvis John. If anyone's out there and you know, you have anything do. Can you write down everything Carl says from now to a year and send it to me and Steve? Because you might want to put it in a book. Yes. Is that. Is that. Would that be good? Just maybe someone keep a journal of everything Carl does and says. I'm gonna try and keep a scrapbook of pictures. Tell you. I would have Peter K. Right. He'd be good. He'd be brilliant. I might be something. Please. I mean, you friends with. No, but I mean. Yeah, all right. Which one. Which one would you do as himself or one of his characters? He does just as he is. Yes. It's funny. He's a funny man. Yeah. Love him. Else probably that. That fellow who lost his arm when he was climbing that mountain, remember? Yeah. Why would you have him? I just. I'd just like to have a chat with him and say, you know what happened there then. Yeah, well, we know what happened there. He cut his arm off. What would you say? Did it hurt? Yes, it hurt, but I don't think it would hurt. That's one of the questions you talking about. I reckon the shock canceled any pain out. If you're stuck there with a boulder on your arm, you've probably got bad pins and needles, right? Yeah. With a big rock on your arm. And you'd say, right. So how long you sat there before you said, well, I've got to cut this off. Did you read about it? It was amazing. What do you think the other people would be doing when you were talking about this? But about cutting his own mark. John Merrick wouldn't mind. Elvis would probably be off his head. On summer. Elephant man will be having a couple of buns. I hope Peter K didn't make a funny comment. I hope he doesn't make a funny comment. Yeah, right. Bloke with. Bloke with one arm. Bloke. Be careful, Carl, what you serve for dinner. Yeah, cuz he's only got one arm. Yeah. You know, certain things. I mean, maybe suggest something you can eat with chopsticks or a hamburger. A hamburger. But don't go with something like lobster trick. You need both hands for that. And there's him and John Merrick teamed up. I think they've got one good arm each. Yeah. Soup maybe. What? Give John Merritt buns. Dav. That woman. That woman in the boat who went around the world. Why? You know, she might boring guests. Really. Hey, but boring? What do you mean? She was going. Well, I didn't see a lot. I was in a cabin. Really? A lot of water. A lot of water. I was a bit scared. The main thing I'd want to ask her, right. Because I remember when she did it and there was an interview with her and her parents were there or something, and a man was saying, oh, she's dead proud. Because she decided to go around the world in a boat as a kid. Instead of just hanging around on street corners and stuff. She said didn't. She didn't want a daughter to, like, be messing about on the streets at night on her own and stuff. She was a responsible mother. Yeah. And she sent her off on a boat on her own. Yeah. I think even Manchester safer than that in it. Yeah. And I'd have probably another woman. So to chat to her. Probably go for Kim Marsh. Sorry, sorry. You'd have the woman who sailed around the world, right. But you'd have to have another woman for her to have someone to talk to. Well, why invite either of them then if you don't want to talk to either of them yourself? I love this. Round the world yachts woman. Round world yachts woman. And Kim Marsh. But why of all the women you. Could invite Kim love, that's the best list I've ever heard. Elvis, John Merrick, Peter K. A bloke with one arm. The round the world yachts woman. Chatting to Kim Marsh. That is genius. Why haven't they invited you on this show? I'm gonna call Ann Robinson. Right. Okay. If anyone's listening to that, I've. Kyle Pilkington. I know no one knows who he is yet, but what a great bit of conversation. Play a record, car. You're an idiot. Some Smith. Oh, always a treat. Yeah. We played something from Morris's selection. Something that would be on my ultimate compilation is something from the Smiths. And it'll probably be this one I started. Something I couldn't finish up. I think that's one of their underrated albums. Rick Strangeways, here we come. It might be my favorite. It's my favorite, certainly. And that's from the album. Queen of Sunny Dead is a lot of it was favorite, but I don't like the wacky one. He's got some great one. I think he's got some of his best tunes on there. But I don't know, they're frankly, Mister Shank. Yeah. He's always got this. This tendency to sort of write music hall style songs. That's a great one, that. So there you go. Elvis. John Merrick, Peter K. Bloke with one arm, woman who sailed around the world. Kim Marsh. What I like about those two numbers, four and five, he doesn't even know their names. Yeah. I'm hoping you'll just write on the invitation. Yeah. It's better than most, but I imagine most people, they do as if they go, Nelson Mandela. I know, of course. Yeah. Oh, I think I read an interview with Mick Hucknall where it was something like, who do you admire? Nelson Mandela? Brilliant. I was read. I don't read papers when I'm in this country. When I was, there was an article in there about Beckham meeting him and the article was about how many people have met him. And I was thinking, we are the only three people that haven't met him yet. It's just like, does he rent himself out? Know, it's not the back of that. You know, in the back of the stage where you can get a caprice lookalike to wander around. They go, is that a lookalike? No, that's really him. 40 quid he'd come to your party. I think what it is is that he was locked up for so long. Yeah, he's. Now he's a social. It's like Salmon Rushdie. He's running around. I've seen him twice. Yeah. His house must be a tip. He's never in. God. Well, I think it is, if you. If you. If you stay indoors for a long time. Yeah. You've got a bit stair crazy, I suppose. Yes, mate. He's met some of the great names in world events. Obviously, he's met the spicy girls. Alan Titchmarsh. Yeah. They did his garden, didn't they? Yeah. David Michael. Yeah. Oh, that must have been great. But, I mean, maybe we could hold out and never meet him. Yeah. Even if we get invited. One of my. No. Yeah. Not really. We're the only three people who've never met Nelson Mandela. I'm not meeting until I make sure he's definitely going straight. I don't like to hang out with people. No, I wouldn't invite him to my ultimate dinner party in case, you know, the silverware missing. Well, you don't know. He was inside for a long time. You know, they pick up things in these places. You can pick stuff up. It's usually Carl that comes out with those sort of things. Carl, what do you think? Of that. Well, Nelson not having him around cuz he's nicking. Well, let's back out now. Let's back out now while we're ahead. We could in celebrity big brother. Yeah. Being used to being locked up in that. I started something I couldn't finish. Yeah, let's play another record. Or should we talk about some on a lighter note? Muffy the hamster had a narrow escape with it. Play us on. Let's have a Rockmaster's answer. Martina Topley Bird. Need one. All right, XFM 104.9. Well, it's that time. It's getting exciting. We've got Rockbusters results. But before that, little bit of monkey news with. Oh, chimpanzee. That monkey news. Brilliant. Last. We're at that for a couple of weeks. Go on in. All right, so that this little monkey. Oh yeah, it lives in Morocco, right? You don't just warn you now you're on thin ice from last time. Okay, so make sure there's this real think about as you're saying it. Think to self. Is that true? Do monkeys do that? Do they think like that? So corn in. So anyway, yeah, so there's this magician in Morocco, right? Got a little monkey working with him, right? Used to work magician. Used to do his thing on stage, do a little bit of magic. People loved it. Then the monkey came out, had a little cap, walked around the crowd and stuff. Got the money at a good little team thing going on, right? Yeah. So anyway, the monkey's name was 86, right? Because back then there was so many monkeys, it was like, oh, what names do you know? I mean, what name? So they just named, right? So this, this little monkey, he had 86. Monk, other monkeys. No, no, it's just that because a lot of monkeys were sort of working back then, helping magicians out, you know, doing bits and pieces, buskin, what have you. Why would there be a confusion with that? If he only had one monkey, where's the confusion? People would go, I'm not going to go and see that. I want to see 86. He's the better monkey, do you know? I mean, what does it matter what you mean? Well, why do they need. Where was the confusion with people going to the circus and going, what monkey gonna see tonight? I don't know. It wasn't a billing, was it, with a monkey? But Rick, it's just the same with humans. You know, there's so many humans now that we can't give them names anymore. Yeah, numbers. Exactly. Yeah, there's so many humans, you know, with 5 billion people. Like, we can't give a name. It's impossible. But, you know, with a few money. So anyway, so there he is, 86. 86 with his hat, walking around getting the money. Yeah. Anyway, the magician sort of, you know, thinking about moving on, because in Morocco he'd sort of done all the tourist traps. Sure. So he had a word with the monkey, said, how about we continue? Think he didn't have a word with a monkey. Let him continue. So what do you think about going over to Spain? Yes, sure. So the monkey was in agreement. So he said, I go on, then. Right, so. So they get in the car and, like, the magician knew he'd have a bit of a problem on his hands because you're not meant to take monkeys out of the country. Yeah, right. So he thought, right, what I'll do, I'll get a car, right, right. Stick the monkey in a boat, right? Get on the boat and hopefully sort of, you know, stick it in some luggage and what have you. Yeah, we'll be over there. We'll be earning big money. Everything's gonna be great. The monkey was like, brilliant. So they get in the car, they're on the way to the. To the boat and pull over at a petrol station. And just before filling up, he opens up the boot and he goes, you all right now? And it's like, yeah. He leaves the boot open so he can breathe and get a bit of fresh air whilst it's filling up. Goes in to pay the money. Yeah, pays the money. Goes, I'm just paying for the. This monkey is not going to drive away in that car or we're never doing this feature again. Carl, what happens? What's up? What's number 86 up to? 86. So that's the ending, isn't it? That's the story. Come on, let's. Brilliant. You're gonna love it. Right, so he's in the petrol station and he's going, right, I'll pay for pump four. And the fellas is what you talk for. Isn't that a monkey? No, sometimes I use numbers for monkey. Sometimes I use. No, I mean pump four. Sure, that's what you're talking about. There's no car up pump for. Right, keep going. Sticks his head out of the door. The monkey's giving it some. Went over to Spain on its own. Let's just. Let's just get a couple of the facts right here. What do you mean, couple of the facts right? There are no facts. So he drove to Spain. You are, honestly, Carl, you must know. It was an automatic. Right. You must know that is shit. There is no way among. The thing with customs mental. How would he get through customs, Carl? Sneaking about because he didn't have a passport. So he parked and then snuck through. John, the facts. Let me see it. Well, I'll examine this, Rick, and we'll play record player. Record. That's. That's nearly as bad as the armed robbery. Right? Go on, play record. Better. Suede. Yeah. Stay together. My favorite. One of 86 is favorites. Yeah, brilliant. My favorite. Sway track. No, stay together. XFM. Well, nearly time to go. But before we do, a little bit of rock buster results. Just checking some of the answers, Rick, and it seems that an awful lot of people have got it right. Go on then. Tell us him again, then remind us of them before you give us the answers. All right. Rockbusters number one was like this. It was a cool stuffing monkey news, by the way, until you start getting some credible ones. Because it. Because that's ridic. Is ridiculous. It's not true. It seems. Seems mad. But no Internet again. So anyone. Anyone can go online, download that story. It's insubstantiate. It's get ones. Get ones from journals or where the source is quoted. Okay. Or we're not interested. Or we're not winner. Well, you don't. Okay, so. Same with on thin ice. We've pulled this once. We've pulled rock. But we suspended it once and you came back again. So it's. Do you know? I mean. So go on then. Right, so rockbusters. Rockbusters number one was about a customer who wanted some paint, wanted to darken up a room. The shop assistant knew what to do. What did she do? The initials were CBD. Seller, black. Right. Seller, black. Seller. See, I thought cineh black because it's CB. And I thought, well, it can't be because it's not seller. It's not sell her black. It's cryptic. No, no, cryptic doesn't mean it's wrong. They all got it anyway, so it's a bit weird in it. Second one. It would be all right if their heads weren't that big, right? Right. The initials. Well, one of my favorite bands. Yeah, yeah, the. The smaller faces, isn't it? Small faces? Well, no. Doesn't make sense. Okay, go on then. And the final one. Chanel, I've got another perfume out. I just say we've had an email for one of our listeners who said, if this turns out to be new order, he's never listening to XFM again. Again, Chanel, I've got another perfume out. New odor. Right. Well, that's another listener gone. What do you mean? There's not a group called no odor. No, it's cryptic. It's not. That doesn't mean cryptic. Wrong. Doesn't mean cryptic. It's like saying, what animal I thinking of? Frog it. That doesn't mean cryptic. Sell her black. What artist is that? Small faces. Works just about if I say what. Animal I'm thinking of monkey. So it does work. Play record. Play record. So who's a winner? Ah, yes. Now I'm gonna give it to someone who emailed in with the correct answer. And his name is Steve Martin. The last few weeks, I've been given the prize to people with just a kooky element to them. You know, sending that name in like Barry Bump fried. Well, don't worry, because I can spot if it's like it was a fake comedy name. What was that last one we laughed at? Gerald something. Yeah, it was. It was like Gerald Smethurst or something. Preston. Why is that funny name? Jerry Preston. A great guy, but Jerry Preston. We laughed at that. He caught my attention. So this week Steve Martin's caught my attention. Right? Yeah. When was the last time Steve Martin made you laugh? This Steve Martin. Dickers has been. Yeah. We've had no correspondence from. From Dickey Anderson for some time, which saddens me. Little Dick Meister general. What is he doing out there? Has he got what he's got? Like he's got something better to do. Ridiculous. Pathetic. Right. So that's the end. We've got the last song. So is there anything. Rockbusters. And it's the end of monkey news. Monkey news. I give you one more. Go for it. It's got to be crazy. It's gotta be real. It's gotta be true. We need to see your sources. It needs to be. Okay. Rockbusters. They've got to be real band names. New odor. New odor. New odor. Just anything. Just brilliant. Hold on to Steve. You got them all. So is that it, then? Yeah, pretty well. I've enjoyed that. Hope your backs better, Rick. Yeah. And Carl, I hope you buck up your ideas. Your brain's better. Yeah. Got something interesting about a brain we can talk about next. No, tell it now. No, quickly. What is it? No, we'll leave it. Oh, that's a hook. Like, people will be going for a week. What things are Carl's brain? Was it a brain that drove a motorbike across to Switzerland? You've heard it.",
