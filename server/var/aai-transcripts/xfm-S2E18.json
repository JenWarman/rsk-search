He's been in about three minutes and he's in a bad mood, getting stressed. If you can't hack it, leave. What's the matter with you? No, I'm just saying it's been. I was meant to enjoy last Saturday often. I didn't. Why not? Why is that our fault? Because you weren't here. Just because. I don't know. But are you not in the Christmas spirit? Why didn't you enjoy last Saturday? What did you do? I went, right, I went all the way back up north again, right, because it was Suzanne's dad's birthday, right. I was busy last week. Didn't have time to get him a present or anything. Didn't have time to get. So I got to Houston station, bought a card for him, which was a Christmas card. So he wasn't happy because he was saying, it's me birthday. And I said, well, I won't be seeing you again. So I've got a joint card. And then we went out. Did you get him a present? Well, no, because we went out on Saturday night for something to eat at this pub that he likes. It's a nice steak and onion rings, right? So it should be happy anyway. Yeah, but what, you paid for it. No, no, but you should have been happy. Suzanne pay for that because it is her dad, right, not mine. So I said, all right, what can I do? I said to her. So she said, just buy a few drinks or something. Anyway, I didn't get around to getting drinks, so I said, right, I'll pay for the cab. Right. Oh, what a lovely Christmas gift that is. Yes, I paid. No, it was like three quid back. So six quid you spent on him? Well, no, I spent more. They, see, that's what he said. He said, bolton and back. He said, oh, you've spent on me six quid for me birthday. I said, no, I haven't, because I. The tax driver, I'm a little bit. Worried about his attitude as well because, I mean, that is a stingy present. But you don't go. You don't say, I mean, let's go. Is that's the worst Christmas gift ever because, I mean, you're pretty bad, like we discussed in the past, but at least you spend a bit of money. Yeah, it's just thoughtless. Yes, it's nothing. Giving him any time. I mean, I would and I knew, and I knew. My, my demographic, they loved it. My family, they couldn't believe their luck, you know. A tenor. You spent a tenor on him? Well, the cab, there was six. But the thing is, he doesn't. It's not. I don't think he's saying that. I think it's the fact that this is like, you know, frittering away. He would have loved. I'm sure he would have been appreciative of a lovely ten pound gift that you cared about and bought. But he probably likes fly fitting, doesn't he? By Junior Hartley. If you'd have bought that either gone. That's what I was looking for. Or what I was looking for. Carl. E bloody el. Carl. You little bald twat. That's just what I wanted. So, all right, so just calm down. So what have you got planned for for Christmas? Is this what. I mean, are you spending. Are you doing the same? Excellent. You've paid me milk bill for this week. That were reap nice. I'm spent this year. So have you planned anything for Suzanne or you just. Yeah, I'm taking her out Christmas day for something to eat. Well, don't. Does she know that is that was that. She's working today, so she, you know. Right. So what Christmas gift have you got? I say I'm taking her out. Well, young. Got young. Got a present? No, because we spent a lot. Don't forget. That's half yours, though. You're gonna be. You're not gonna just be sitting there watching her eat, going, oh, I'm hungry. But I spent all. You're gonna be eating as well. That's half yours. So you've got. She's got. She's got nothing to unwrap. There's nothing. She's gonna hand something over to you because I've met the woman. She will. She'll hand something over. You'll open it. You'll love it. I might get something today. God. Well, we're gonna try and stick in some Christmas songs. We're not playing all Christmas songs. But I've already covered. So this is Christmas. John Lennon, Joni Mitchell time, New York. One of the best Christmas songs ever. Oh, what about a bit of pretenders? That's a good one. 2000 miles, pretenders. 2000 miles on XFM 104.9. This sort of Christmas edition. We're not here next week, are we? No. Carl is. Aren't you? Well, you are, in a way. I was doing the best of it. Is it a best off? Yeah. Brilliant. Have you been putting together? Not yet. Okay. I'll do it today. Tell me what bits you want in it and I'll sort it out. It's not for me, is it? Yeah, these are best stuff. Well, maybe people could email him with their. The highlights of the year for them. I'm trying to think what they were. I mean, mostly every. Mostly Carl. Mostly Carl gibberish from Carl. I think it'd be an awful lot of educating Ricky from Carl. Hmm. Well, Ricky dot gervaisfm dot co dot UK, if you've got any thoughts on stuff you'd like to hear again, is. There anything you'd like to hear of Carl saying somewhat stupid me and Steve laughing or slapping him? Yeah, that's basically the competition, isn't it? There's a couple of instances where I tried to kiss him, I think, and you encouraged me. Yeah, those are some highlights for me. I wish I had a video that. Yeah, so do I. You mentioned educating Ricky. We've only got. Do you know we normally have like three instalments? Yeah, we've only got two today. Why? Well, you clearly weren't busy Christmas shopping. So what's next? Yeah, yeah. Well, like I say, every week it's a bit of a struggle finding stuff that I can teach you, but at the same time, what we have got, we've started the feature, a teased MTV with it. Right. So I thought I'd best start doing it before they get someone like Zane Lowe presenting it or something. So do we need them? Do we need them? You should explain. Do we need them for those that don't like the show? Well, it's sort of education about animals and stuff and if we need them. So, like David Attenborough once said, you can get rid of people off the earth and it would carry on, there's no problems. But, you know, get rid of a monkey and you could have problems on your hands. So is that a direct quote from Attenborough's current automatic? I think so, yeah. So what I've done today. Right, so then. Yeah, exactly. So. And he always ends things. You've got yourself all quite sort. Yeah, yeah. So that's, that's coming up. Enjoy that. Enjoy that. I've spoke to a woman about jellyfish. Oh, yeah. Because I know you're not a fan. Not a fan of them. So we'll be speaking to women or jellyfish. This is a woman. Yeah. So we'll be sorting that out before 03:00 we'll be finding out if we need them and then we've got a Christmas edition of Rockbusters. Found out yesterday. Go on channel four. Have ripped it off. Go on. It's on their teletex thing. That's. Yeah. On their teletext page. Someone said, what are they doing, then? Like rockbusters? The copying the format. You sure they're not copying blockbusters? No, no, it's. It's. Someone said, it's a cryptic clue of abandoned. That and initials and you work it out. That is despicable. I mean, investigate this. So they've fundamentally ripped off the idea of being out allowed to do a cryptic clue to get a band. Yeah, but they saw clever cryptic clues. I should just point out, because it's Christmas time. We've had an email from Dickey Anderson. Dickers. Yeah. Ra is. I suppose he's a long time listener. Yeah. And emails us most. Most weeks. Ricky, if, as I suspect, I'm your only listener, I wouldn't bother with your show today as I've got to attend some family Christmas nonsense at Auntie Marion's house. He's good because considering he hates the show and everything we stand for. He does. He does take the time to email every week. That counts. That counts to advertisers. Yeah. I think we've got a lot like him. We've also had a lovely Christmas card here from Alexandra. Right, who's wishes? She loves the show. She loves you, Carl. And she's enclosed some biscuits. Biscuits for you to save you a bit of money, because you goes out and get your own biscuits and we've got some lovely little packet. Why don't you wrap them up and you can give them to your girlfriend, Don and blitzen from the about boys center by badly drawn boys. Christmas theme there. Christmas theme there. You spotted the Christmas theme. Yeah. Carl's not really in festive mood, but. I can't imagine Christmas is your time of year, is it, Carl? I'm not sure any time of the year is really. I liked it when I was about. I think when I to was about seven. I enjoyed it. Was that the one? Was that the year? The big year? Loads of stuff. You don't have to worry about anyone else, but once you've, like, got a job. What did you get when you do your pay? Proud. Older you then? I was about 1340. That was you then. You're a man when I had to buy stuff. Oh, but you still. That's coming from him, Carl. My dad always. Oh, it's. Did he on that said Christmas morning was for like, you know, for me, so he used to stay in bed, so he never. That's brilliant. That's a great thing saying it. Yeah. Yeah. Christmas morning's for you. Run wild, do what you want. Just don't bother me to Honolulu for two weeks. That's great. Dad, it's Christmas. Do I have to do anything? No. So my mom used to get up because she used to like to see my face light up, you know, when I opened my presents and then fireworks and then go to my bedroom from about 06:00 onwards, because, like, my mum, dad were in serving big Christmas parties, and I wasn't, like, old enough to go. Right. So they say, right, you know, you've had your fun, there you go to your bedroom, staying there. Really? Yeah. I remember one year, right, I got. Got a train set. That's what I wanted. Yeah, right. It's brilliant. Playing with it all day, I thought, I don't mind about the party. I'm happy staying up here, playing with this brother comes in. He's had a few, right. He's going, yeah, give us a go on yourself. How old is he? He's. He's a bit older than me, so he might have been like, let's see. Well, let me. Let him be 18. Yeah. Probably about 1819, I was. Well, I had a train set, so I don't know, about 14, something like that. Right. So I'm playing on that, loving it and stuff. And then he comes in and goes, oh, gives a go. He turns the transformer up to, like, 14. He went really fast for about 5 seconds, broke it, and then he went back downstairs. Wow. So Christmas ironing got, like, the conservative. Government with British Rail. Satire. Satire. It doesn't work in any way because it says the analogy falls down apart from there being a train. Think it through, though. British Rail was trains. Yeah. And the government broke the trains in many way. They didn't break them, like, not officially breaking them, but they can. It does work perfect. I'm pretty pleased with that. And I can't. And no one's asked him to be on if I got his view. It's weird, isn't it? Because it's strange that you're going, that's as quick as that. Yeah. And it's broke, your little train set. So what did you do? I just, like, watched telly and had some sausages. I bet you happy with that. They weren't, you know, you know, when your main present of the year has. Been broke and did it ever get it fixed? Now, that was it. That was it. I'm intrigued why your parents wouldn't let you come and join in. The festive fun was it like, really the borch down there, was it like eggnog everywhere? Well, no, but I mean, that's fair enough. Six seems a little bit early, but I just think, you know, if you're your kid, you know, he had those fun. Put him to bed. Put him to bed at eight maybe. And he was on Christmas day for. That was a day for family. Well, not if there's a party going. On and have the party on the Christmas days. Well, that's, that's, that's another option, yeah. Your parents are weird. Are they? A strange breed. Well, I think that was the year, right? I. You're talking about buying presents and stuff. I think I did treat me man, so I didn't buy me dad anything. I think that was like when I got a bit older, used to get me to him because he wasn't that bothered. Anyway, so got me ma'am. It was a cheap shop, of course. Thank God for that. Called snips. So I went in there and I thought, let's see what I can get her. And remember Victoria Plum? I don't think so. Well, it's like a fairy character, right? Right. I mean, I'm into gnomes and stuff, right? So I thought, right, she must be. Pleased with you then. Victoria, I was thinking, is that one of the neighbors? Is it, is it like a brandy or. Victoria Plum. Victoria Plum. Victoria Plum. Yeah, it's like a little fictional sort of character. Okay, okay. So I saw it, I thought, yeah, she'll love that. Right? So I did me paper round, saved up for two weeks, right? Got that sorted, went to snips, bought the Victoria plum next day. I mean, I'm in town with her, right? So I think, ah, I know what I'll do. I said, come, come in here a minute. Right? So we go in and we're looking around and I tested her, right? I went, look at that there. That's all right, innit? And she goes, oh, it's bloody awful. Oh, Carl. Oh, Carl. I just, I. Oh, God. So then Christmas day comes, I said, don't bother opening it. She said, no, no, why? Oh, no, why don't you still give it to her? So, well, it's too late, I'd already bought it. Oh, cool. So she opened it and I was like. And she said, oh, that's nice. I said, why are you saying that? I said the other day, so it's bloody awful. She said, oh, no, I thought you're pointing at something else. Oh, no. So that's why I don't get anyone anything anymore. Oh, God. Play record. Oh, God. Oh, that's good. Gold rush let you down? I'm actually quite affected by Carl's Victoria plum scenario. Just the fact that, like, that, that eagerness. He wants to make sure it's a great present. He's saved up his paper round. He thinks it's like a gnome, but modern. I'm worried that you're using it as an excuse now. And that's why you're not buying anyone any gifts, because you had your fingers burned once. I mean, you were six, seven years old, to be fair. No, you weren't. You're about 13, weren't you? If you're doing your paper round. Yeah, it must have been, yeah. Eleven or twelve, then. All right, yeah. So that saved up. Oh, no, I'm not using it as a thing. It's just. What do you get your mum this year? I've sent them some money so they can get a passport. Are they trapped somewhere? They're in a holding bay somewhere in Dover. What do you mean, so they can buy a passport? What do they do? Sell it when they were a business? No, they haven't got that much money. Right. They've never been abroad and the mate said they might tack them next year. And they said, oh, we haven't got a passport. So buy a passport, have you? Isn't that your God given right as an Englishman? No, you got to pay for them. They're 30 quid each. So you better add do. Otherwise they're conning me. Right. 60 quid in the well check. Right. I love that. If you're watching Teddy France to come on and they go, oh, what do you think of that? She goes, it looks bloody awful. Don't open it, don't open it, don't open it. You've not paid for a holiday for them. You know, just sorting out the. Well, it's the better prize in it because they can't go anywhere without it. Well, the passport keeps on giving. Yeah. Ten years. Ten years, that is. Yeah. So. But no, I never used to. I mean, I can't think of other things. I used to get me dad once. Once I started getting him stuff, it used so used to be dressing gown and then. But as an extra surprise, he used to put, like, a cigar in the pocket. So he'd think that was it. Yeah. Then he'd put it on and put his hand in the pocket. Right. And then he just hit you because he thought you'd nicked it. Yeah. Oh, dear. So you bought him a jacket with a cigar that's quite thoughtful. Did you sneak a cigar once on Christmas? Well, it was when. That's when they used to have, like, the big do's. Like I say, you know, they would do a. Known for it, like the whole estate used to know that, you know, we were having a party. Yeah. So they'd all come round. So they all come round and food and drink and that. I cannot imagine how unpleasant that must have been. Awful. And you locked in your bedroom with a broken train set. Yeah. And looking at Victoria Plum, whatever that was. In the bin. Oh, in the bin, yeah. And here a mom saying. And he got me this piece of rubbish. You could hear him just throwing it against the wall and laughing. And you'd come down just being pieces with loads of spit on it, just loads of scratches. And all the Polaroids are them. Just like, laughing at it and pointing, stamping on it. But no, no, I used to get up in the morning and then, like, they'd still. Still sort of all be there asleep on the floor and on the sofa. Christmas is surely the one day a year which is a family thing. It's for the kids. They're the ones. That was boxing Day. Well, I know. That's all right. It's over. Back on the bike. All right, who's gonna pay for this? What, me? Yes. Carl. You're doing two rounds today. Yeah. What's your paper round? Supporting the entire family. So I used to get up and, like, go downstairs and they'd be asleep. So I'd be mooching about, trying to find, like, another present that's still working. I love the idea that these people from the estate had, like, squashed his presence. Yeah. So I found a cigar that had been sort of lit up and then put out. So I thought, oh, I'll have a go at that. Going outside and had a go. And that's the last time I smoked. Right. I tried it. I thought, I don't like that. I love the fact that he does everything once. Yeah. In his life. It's like the line of, I've done everything once, I don't need to do it again. Oh, dear. You know, I said in the past to you, Rick, that my grandparents. So I love them dearly, but it's like, for the last 30 years, they've been waiting to die. I know. It's like they just sort of. It's like, you know, the novelty wore. Off of, like, in the fifties. Got kind of bored of it, like. Yeah. In the forties it was brilliant. All sat around the old Joanna singing, they love that. The fifties, you know, that was great as well, because that was the post war years. It was a bit tight in the pocket, but it was all right. Everyone pulled together. Then the sixties came along. All the crazy music, the funny hair. Let's stay in bed. They basically stayed in bed. And it was one Christmas when my grandmother said to my dad, what Christmas? What do you fancy for Christmas? And this must have been, I don't know, 20 years ago. She said, what do you. What do you fancy for Christmas, Ron? And he went, well, you know, I could do with a nice big kind of warm winter overcoat. She said, don't worry about that. Don't worry about that, because your father will be dead soon. It's. What you can have is me and my granddad. Let's be honest with you, my father's still waiting, which is good news. Good news for my grandfather. How is he today? He's fine. Okay. Oh, I'm freezing. It is such a weird mindset that. I think it's. That, to me, is what sums up people from that older generation, the forties and fifties. And it seems to me that you've got that kind of mindset. It's like you were born in the thirties. Whenever you talk of your childhood, it's like you had like, a baked potato to take. The other thing is, I think that sort of generation, it seems that the man is dependent on the woman. There's a total dependent. If she dies, he's done. Yes, he's done for it. Just pine away. If he dies, she's got 30 years of pottering. Absolutely. Going to like, you know, the youth club and it's sort of like that. It's. It was sad. Of course it's sad for them, but it's not the end of their life. No shit. It sort of is the other way around. I don't know why that is. Yeah, it's terrible. It's a little melancholy thought for. I know. Brought. You brought it down. You've brought it down. I bought it. This isn't a nice show at all. This is terrible. We're gonna killing themselves. What? No, I didn't really want to make it a Christmasy type show because I don't really like it. He's done it again. What? He did Christmas once. Didn't like it. No, he's just religious or anything. What are you? You're not anything. Teenage fan club from the XFM Christmas album. And that's Christmas Eve. Their guitar sounds are just brilliant. They're just always so nice. All right. Carl's like that teenage fan club. Yeah, yeah, they're good. I feel like you've never kind of enjoyed the wonder of Christmas. I don't think I can ever get the sense. Maybe, except when you were very, very young, you know, that kind of bright eyed, you know, thinking of Santa, you know, kind of landing on the roof and coming down the chimney and drinking the sherry or whatever. I like. I like the idea of it. The sort of, you know, I used to like. I used to get a couple of annuals every year, you know. Yeah, totally. Yeah. And I was allowed to open one on Christmas Eve. Oh, that's brilliant. Just. Yeah, so they could throw it on the fire. Off the cooker. Well, anyway, listen, I'm a good friend of ours, Ross noble, comedian, brilliant. He's giving me this picture, Carl, which he's got from magazine. He loves you. I think this. I just looked at it then obviously it's not going to mean much to the listener. Oh, this is currently available, I think. It'S in the current edition of Bizarre magazine, so you might want to buy. Not horrible, though, is it? There's a certain grotesqueness about it. Oh, it's a deformed person, isn't it? To a degree. But I think what it's going to do for Carl is giving. I think just. I think for you and I, Rick, we're going to see his face light up, brighten up. Lighten up. Like opening a wonderful Christmas gift. I think I've seen this. Is this the one with the kid with the big head? I'll be honest with you, Carl. It is. Have you seen it already? Let me just show it to you. Again so you can see. We shouldn't be laughing at that. No, but that is like the kid who I went to school with. That is the same. So do you recognize him? Seriously? That. That is the same thing. Yeah. It's being computer generated. It's so odd. But look at the child's face. I know. Don't take another photo of me. I'm not sure this is right. It's not right. It's not right. But I just. I was hoping that that would give you, Carl, just a little glimpse of. We've had a request as well. The best bits to. Someone wants to hear you talking about your mates with the big heads, because. Every time we go there again, we get some sort of complaint about something. About what? Leave it. Well, that for some reason that always goes from the story with me dad going to Blackpool for taking those kids there. And what, kids leave it. No, there's people when we put a song on. No, well, I know what it is, but you can't just say that. Is it when. Okay, is it when your dad put a kid in the wheelie bin because he was getting out? Yeah. We can't go through it again. Too controversial. We're gonna. What's her name? No, the thing is, right, you were just saying about. What are you, about Christmas? That's the funny thing, right? Because in our house there's no one who's religious, right. No. My dad got annoyed when I went to church that day. Like what you're doing that for? Course. I went to see a gig in Liverpool. Remember the band the Christians? Yeah. He thought, join some club. Yeah. I said, I've been to see the Christians. He was saying to me, man, what's he doing going out with them? Yeah. Yeah. And then the other thing is, because I'm not christened or anything, my mom used to say to me, don't tell anyone that because there's witches and stuff. I just want to go back and see him at seven. One day. One day in the life of Carl, just doing ghosts, visiting tonight. Back through time. But we could go with him. Well, we. Give me some of the ghosts. Yeah. Remember this? That's incredible. So she was what? She thought maybe someone could take your soul because you weren't christian. Like this cult. And if they find out you're not christened. Right. I don't think they care. I don't think a lot of cults care. What can they do if you're, if you're not christian? I just said, all right. Because then through that time, there must have been a time when. Yeah, but I'm older now, so I'm all right. She used to worry about me playing out on the street. Oh, she was worried about whether you're not even stupid and easily led. Yes. Yeah. No, good point. No, you're right now. Yeah. So, yeah. Good. Rockbusters. Rockbusters will tell the prizes. Steve. Yeah? We have Christmas gift. This is Christmas gifts. I don't know if you'll receive them in time to actually pass them off as gifts. I wonder if I can tell that Ross noble story that he told us. I don't know. We'll have to discuss that when the records play. Okay. Okay. So you heard a track from it just then? It's the XFM Christmas album, I think that's been knocking around here in the office for years. Isn't it, Karl? Or is it new? This year. It was brought out about two years ago. Christmas songs are Christmas time songs. Yeah, it's not bad. It's got bands on there like Dandy Warhol's, the web brothers are on there, drugstore Bell and Sebastian, flaming lips, all sorts. So we've got that to give away. We've also got this smashing pumpkins compilation, which we seem, again, that seems to be knocking around for weeks. Another one of those 50 years of the greatest hit singles. I don't know, culture clubs on their queen. I've seen the cult film. Yeah, the cult film we'll come back to shortly. This, I think, is one of the most exciting gifts. If you have a video player and you want to get trimmed, then surely big brother three champion Kate Lawler and her cardio combat video, in which I think she uses kind of, I don't know, military boxing training to get you trim and taught and looking as good as her, then you can get that as well. We've also got a exclusive seven inch single from the White Stripes, a kind of Christmas single. Is that from them? Yeah. Yeah. That must be quite rare. That's probably worth something. And the current badly drawn boy album, have you fed the fish? Which they've gone up, actually. I think that the level of prices there has gone up. Not bad selection. But here is the big movie. And actually, I have to say, this is not a bad one. No, it's not. Again, it's not. Not terrible at all. It could be worse. It's James can in the original rollable, not the disastrous remake that came out recently, but the DVD version of Rollable. So that's there as well. So something fairly interesting that's worth winning. Right, come on, then. Let's do Rockbuster. Will we play a song to give picture time to get a pen and paper on that? Yeah. Yeah. So we're doing it next? Yeah. Carl Pilkington, the man of the moment with his rock busters, coming your way with all those great prizes. I noticed Heat magazine sort of put a bit of a spanner in the works. Why? Because they were saying, oh, maybe it'll be a Christmas edition of Rockbusters. And I'd already sorted them out. I wouldn't worry, Carl. Well, what I've done, I've cleverly tweaked them to make them Christmassy. So the Christmas bet in it has got nothing to do with. With it whatsoever. But I just thought. So you mean the clues have a Christmas element, but it's nothing to do with the answer? Yeah, it's nothing to do with the answer. Right. So why don't you just ask the normal ones and I'll ring a bell. I'll shake some bell goes in sort of speech. So the first one, there's a load of letters there asking for advice. Put them on Claire's desk. Oh, and have a good Christmas. Give it to us again. Oh, God. Right, so there's a load of letters asking for advice. Put them on Claire's desk. Owen. Have a good Christmas. Right, bear in mind, people, that the Christmas element may not be relevant to these clues. Nothing to do with it. I don't want to. And the initial letter is f, right? That's f. All right. The second one, ask your mom if you should after you've wrapped the presents. Ask your mom if you should. Ask your mom if you should after you've wrapped the presents. That's, that's s s. And the last one, a couple of people were arguing in the supermarket at the fruit and veg counter. But it's busy in there because it's Christmas. So they're the three or just recap. Yeah. I have no idea. I don't know what to start thinking. Well, right, there's a load of letters there asking for advice. Put them on Claire's desk. Have a good Christmas. Second one, ask your mom if you. Should after you write the prison s. And the last one, a couple of people were arguing, arguing in the supermarket at the fruit and veg counter. But it's busy in there because it's Christmas. That's a b. So they're the three things. It's email only. This one, please remember that. Ricky Gervais at XFN. Co UK. Ricky Gervais fm dot co dot uk. All right. Is there gonna be more rockbushes in the new year? We're not sure. I'm still thinking about new ideas that we can do. Okay, are we starting Ricky Dicky list today? Have you done forward to Ricky Dick? What he did? He said asked and he just stopped because he's worried because he's a producer. Yeah, well, I've got a set of standard. Oh, dear Carl. You have, mate. You have. So that's that. We've still got to come. Oh, I tell you what, why don't we have a lovely tune, right, you make the tea, we're open these biscuits from Alexandra. We'll be enjoying that. Right. Maybe segway so we can have a nice little rest. I don't want to talk through it. It'd be rude. And then we're coming back and as part of, like, Pilkington Parkinson. And do we need them? Do we need them? Carl has interviewed an expert on jellyfish. We've got that. Plus, of course, we've got two part. A two part educating Ricky. Got educating Ricky still with Christmas theme or not. And we've still got things like the pogues, John Lennon, Joni Mitchell, just David Bowie. Are you suggesting there's gonna be some. Great music and some fun chat? Lovely. Good. We had our little biscuits, haven't we? I think I can just sum up the station, can't I, Steve? Without just last coming. You're probably right. I just came in, I just went to toilet there and it's a disabled toilet, it's close to it. So, you know, you go there. I had a way. I thought, oh, the thing doesn't work, didn't flush. I came back and said, oh, the toilet doesn't work, doesn't flush. And Kyle went, no, just stick your hand down and pull that wire up. At the hand in the water. I mean, just when David Bowie interviewed Zoe, there's toilets on flash, he goes, all right, bro, just stick your hand and pop the shit down the. Down the u bend and just wipe your hands on your pants. Thanks very much. I mean. Oh, sums up this station, doesn't it? Absolutely. Tin pot. Have you ever done this? This is one of my most embarrassing moments is, you know, because sometimes you'll see, well, you'll realize. What I was going to say. What happened, Rick, was I almost leapt to the end of the story. Right. But I realized I had to go back a few steps. I just don't. Have you ever cut? Well, it was going to be coming, but it. But you'll understand in a minute when I finish the story that it's not coming in the traditional sense. All right. Because it also is followed by coming out of. Oh, sure, yeah. So. And not your trousers. Okay. Okay, now, awkward moment. And I should just. You know, if you're Christmas shopping, maybe you're in a big department store and you see the disabled toilet and you think to yourself, I can nip in there. I can use that. You know, because it's close to hand, because I got a wander miles for the regular toilets. I went in there once in 20, you know, disabled toilets. Snuck in, came out, disabled person furious. That was. But it's really awkward because it is like it's their sort of private domain, you know, it's like. It's like they're part of an exclusive club. They've not got many perks in life. And that's one of them. And here I was, you know, kind of. Kind of exploiting it. Well, yeah, I suppose they can be annoyed. But what do you do affect a limp? You know, I normally do. I often do. I often. I've affected a limp many times. Like, for instance. Yeah. If I take the lift in a building when it's only one flight of stairs, right. And they know and I get up on the first floor, I always reflect a limp coming out. So that justifies why I would come up the stairs. Like, who is it that I'm scared is gonna sort of say something? Yeah. But if someone asked me for directions, I always pretend I'm foreign. I always go, I don't. Why do you do that? Because I'm just terrified of giving them the wrong directions now. I don't know. I don't live because I feel bad, because what? I used to sort of give directions because I like giving directions. I like helping people out. But then I realized I didn't really know. He used to hang around going, you right? Yeah, we're fine, yeah. Do you want to know where to go? I tend to have a go, even if I don't know exactly. But I'm always terrified they'll come back and find you and go, you led us astray. So I. Now I just affect a foreign accent. There's a fellow the other day about two weeks ago, and I was walking in, little old woman, little old fellow come up to me and said, where's Wimpole street? So I said, I do know it. So I think it's over there. And then I'm not very good with street names, but I'm good that if you say, oh, there's a boots on it. I mean, if there's something near. I'm slightly the same with directions when it. When I used to drive a lot. Yeah. Or historical facts. I didn't. I don't know, like old motorway names, you know, and this and m that. Never remember that. But my dad used to always say, right, there's a horse in the field, turn right and stuff like that. And it's the same with this fella. They sort of said, you know, where's. Where's Wimpole Street? I said, well, what are you after? And he said, I'm after some blood. And it was a lot. Yeah. These doctors around there. And they. So I was like, ah. So that didn't help me. What do you mean? He was after some blood. He said, I need some blood. He must have had an illness? No, he just must have needed some new blood or something. He had some illness and I was like, you know, the petrol, get some power. No, like, he didn't have fangs in a cape, did he? Yeah, but do you know what I mean? Oh, that didn't help me out. But what if you said, well, some pile cream. Actually, can you. You go, oh, we want boots then, yeah. Oh, he would have been all right, but I didn't know where to start with that. I need some blood over there. Yes. Sort of pointed him away, but. So he was, he was losing consciousness, you said, in the wrong way. He's dragging himself along the pavement. Is there blood this way? She's growing ever deeper. Well, we've got a. We've got to do Pilkington, haven't we? Yeah. Okay. We should explain this, I think. Well, this, Carl's new idea for a tv show. He wants to do a tv show called do we need him? Where he goes round and he talks to experts like David. David Bellamy, maybe Lenny Henry doing David Bellamy if he can't get the real one and he just picks on an animal that he doesn't really like, doesn't eat him. And an expert will tell him if we do. If this is the first installment, let. Me put a song on right now. We've got them and then I can set it up and tell, you know, explain it in that. Let's do a classic, let's do a big stomp in one of the best Christmas songs of all time, shall we? What you're thinking. Fairytale New York featuring Christian McCall on XFM 104.9. The Christmas edition. Indeed. Next week. We've had loads of just suggestions, Carl, for your best bits, especially all your best bits. Me and Steve are largely irrelevant in the, in the voting, so. Yeah, you can compile your best bets next week and they'll be loving it. We've, we'd request for the. The little chinese fellow in his pants. A horse in the house cutting your hair on the wire. Railway station. If. I mean, if you haven't heard those stories, what does that mean? The little Chinaman in your pants? You've got to be tuning in next week to find out what that is. The only thing is, the old horse in the house was in the last best of. Was it? Yeah. Well, that doesn't stop what's his name. If you're one of those people that want to see these clips again. Yeah, tune in. It'll be around on the night. 84. Yeah. Someone killed me. I think I'm gonna live forever. Like we said before, who goes to the recording of one of those people in the audience? Yeah, that'd be great. Ticket to it. We were out on the night and. They laugh at his jokes. But I mean, I don't know. I think how many takes it, you know, I mean, how long it takes. Takes to record that. This shows about 3 hours. So the recording must be about nine. Have you ever seen Kirstie's home videos on Sky? I think so. I think so. Dogs falling down. It's like. Yeah, it's like you frame but it's. Falling over in a wedding. Got audience laughter but I'm assuming it can't be a real audience. I'm assuming it must be like they've lifted. They've just lifted it from the Flintstones. Yeah. Forget the Flintstones had an audience. If you watch the Flintstones, there's laughter. When Fred does something funny. Yeah. The idea of people shipping shipped in. But we were talking about the idea. That some jokes weren't as funny as others. Like the director going, we'll put a laugh on that. It's not as funny. I think Dino should get a round of applause every time he comes in. Everyone knows him. The kids love him. He said this. Yeah. Barney getting disgruntled because his jokes never get. He's like, wise. Okay, here we go. This exciting feature that will, I think, will be picked up by channel five. It's going to be Carl Pilkington. Do we need them? Where Carl goes around checking out animals with top experts, asking whether we need them in the world. Yeah. So, yeah, this is the first one. We won't do it next week, but I'm already sorting out the contact. We will be looking at Octopus because they're a bit weird. That's what you got to look forward to in two. Again. If you have an animal that you feel is unnecessary in the world, then email us and I'm sure Carl will investigate for you. Well, the other thing as well. Whilst we're onto that, I want to sort of have a better research with me. So when I speak to the, like, the bloke of the woman about the octopus. Right. I want, like you want to be. Well, sort of response from listeners. So I can say, well, 70% of XFM listeners said we should get rid of them. Sure. Like Jon Snow does on channel four when he does all like, politics. So if you agree with me, just send an email saying yes. So, yes, we should get rid of them. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Get rid of them. Because you're. You're always. You're. The house believes always, we should get rid of these animals. That's. You're picking animals you want to get rid of. So, yes, is get rid of them. No, is don't get rid of them. Well, and not. No, it's Noah because they go on the ark, the ones we keep going. The ark. That element I'd completely forgotten about. And I think that's a wise move, because I don't think that's working. I don't think you thought through the whole Noah. See, that's just complicating in the show. I think. So, yes. Yes. We get rid of them, Noah. They're saved on the ark. Right. Okay, so here we go. Today we're looking at jellyfish in Pilkington. Right. I'm talking to. To Vicky, who works in an aquarium in Anglesey. Yes, it is. Yes. Right, brilliant. Today we want to find out if we really need jellyfish. I've got a bit of a problem with them anyway, because I've been stung by one and I've done a little bit of research into them, so I'll tell you what I know about them. Okay. You know, you might learn some stuff from me. Oh, you never know. And if I'm talking nonsense, just. Just tell me. Absolutely. Yeah. Right. So first of all, they don't have eyes, do they? No, they don't. So. All right with that? No lungs. No lungs. They haven't got a heart. No hearts. Heartless. And they're made up of, like, 97% water. Yes, they are. So they're pretty useless, really. Well, they have got a nervous system. They are actually about 650 million years old. So they. They've evolved and they've outlived the dinosaurs, and they're even older than the sharks, and they can even outfox us because NASA scientists have worked with them to try and work out how they operate in weightlessness, and they still don't know how they do that. Took them into space, actually, to figure out how they did that. Seems like a bit of a waste of money. Do you know Port Maddock? I used to go there a lot from the holidays, and there used to be a load of them washed up on the beach. People on motorbikes used to go over them and stuff. Yeah. Well, we get the moon jellyfish. That's the ones with. They've got pink bits in the middle. Yeah, I think that was them. I think they're the ones that went over on the bike. You could see bits. What. What do they do? If the jellyfish went, would we have a problem on our hands? Do they? Okay. You might have a bit of a knock on effect because things like turtles eat jellyfish. Do we need turtles? Well, don't forget that when you take out one, when you take out something from the marine system, something normally feeds on it. I mean, they're not just there for the fun of it. Something either feeds on it or feeds on what they excrete. What you're saying is they exist to sort of feed others and also to eat some stuff that's. Well, yeah. They control the population of other fish and species that might otherwise be a problem. Okay, well, let's, let's kind of wrap this up, right. The question that I'm asking today is, do we need them? Say if. Say if. Noah. Yeah. At his ark. Right. You're, you know, you've swam and got on the boat. You're all right. You're safe. He's going to keep you to sort of populate the world as well. Right. So it's you and him. He's not a bad looking fella. So. So you're happy. Yeah. He says to you, Vicki, do we need them? Absolutely. I don't even know why she even gave you that interview when you start off with. Right. Yeah. Trying to find out if I need Jennifer. What did you tell her to get her to talk to you? Just, just said, I'm doing some research on stuff. Did you think you were schoolboy or something? No, she just said, all right. She said, you know, how long will it go on us for? Not long. Just like five minutes. Have a quick chat. And she was loved it, and she sounded happy to take part in that. So I know you've got an expert, and you, you suggest that she's going to be having sex with Noah. He's good. Infinity or happy? She goes, yeah, I mean, I don't know why you stopped there. Didn't go into positions or something. I, I can't believe. The problem is, really, I didn't get to the bottom of what I wanted to say because. Oh, no, you did. That's it. That's a, that's done now. That's a pretty good academic work. That's proved. No, but the turtle thing, you know, when she said, oh, if you get rid of them, the turtles, you know, won't have anything to eat. But when she said that, I mean, I couldn't say it because it would have took her off and confused her. But what? She's a scientist. She's easily confused. Say, like when. When Suzanne is working, right? I'm not a very good cook, so I always get, like, an indian. In what? I love an indian. Right. Now. Say if for some reason it closed, I get a Chinese. So why don't the turtle just. There's loads of stuff in the sea. But I didn't want to get too heavy on her. But it's pretty deep. Oh, that is genius. But we'll look at. But so the fact that she said, yes, you need. You need jellyfish. Does that mean that you've changed your. I mean, what I'm saying is, does her answer go, does that sound. It does, it does. Yeah. Whatever. That. I get the expert to say, I try and get them in a corner, right? You try. Arguments. A corner. But that time she wasn't having any of it. So we've got a carry on having them. Yeah. So in the new year, we'll be looking at octopus. Okay? Yeah. Yeah. Great place to feed her. Christmas, I think. This car with his Victoria plum. I want to see a Victoria plum. I want to know what it is. I said, is it. Does it look like a little gnome? It's a woman gnome, a female name, a little known. And. And did your mum collect names? She likes anything. Gnomes. She likes fairies. She likes Indians. She collects all that stuff. And it don't matter what you mean, you know, like a proper indian with all the ad gear on or need to. Likes anything with them on. Like, you know, it can be a fridge magnet. It can be, yeah. Just. Just a lot of native american wisdom is. Is around the fridge magnet because I think our special powers of adhesion. Yeah, yeah. That you read some of their writings, the great works. Now, it reminds me, talking of gnomes, he said to me in the week, he went, oh, did you see that program on telly last night about dwarves and fellas without legs nicking cars? And I went, no. He went, oh, it's amazing, right? Because they haven't got legs and that. They scoot along and they can nip into a car like the dukes of hazard. Explain more, Carl. No, you see, I didn't see it. Someone else told me about it. Oh, that's what I said to you. I said, did you see it? Because I missed it. And it's about these, these little fellas who specialize in carnicking. And the thing I wanted to know is, because this lad who sort of watched it, only watched half of it. Is he like you? Well, I said, I can understand how it's easy to get in, but then how do you get away. You can't reach the pedals. Yeah. Can there be two of them? But presumably. What do you mean? What? So he's steering and he's like, right. Press the brake a bit and then there's. Then there's one that's just legs but without the top half. I don't understand how this helps them, though. What are they? What? Why are they. Why does this make it easier for. Them to just get through the window really quickly, like in the dukes of Azid? Why? Because their legs don't get in the way. Right. Do they just run and. Just the wind, I mean. What? So someone's driving a lot. I didn't see it. I didn't. I didn't leap in when there's someone still driving the car. I don't know. Well, there's too many things left unanswered here. I can't go in. But that sort of. This panicked you anyway, I imagine. I bet you were gutted you missed that program, weren't you? Well, I'm interested in stuff like that because I like learning, which gets us on to educating rich. Oh, excellent, slick. We've had a good year of stuff. Teaching us. Well, yeah, I've learned a lot. Can you remember any? Of course I can. There was a deaf girl and she. Her head and she could hear. There was also some people who ate tomatoes, thought their poison was on lead. There was also a fellow who, a doctor who gave a blood transfusion with some parrots from the pet store because the doctor in America, and it was the olden days when the lines were bad, said, give him his parents blood. And the doctor this side thought said, give him some parrot's blood. So that was true. And that educated me. That was fact. What have you got for us? Well, we've only got two, because I've taught you about jellyfish today that we need them. So we've only got two things to go at. And I give them a little headline so you remember them to make them snappy. The two headlines you've got. Oh, what a cato strophe. Okay. And the second one is. Well, you'd think it'd be bughead, wouldn't you? What? Well, you'd think it'd be bughead, wouldn't you? You'd think it beat. No, you'd think it'd be. Yeah, I think it'd be bogged, wouldn't you? Bug head. Bugger. This can't be. If this is anything with a bug living without a head, I'm not interested, because we've done it. All you've done is, let's just do what I catch. No, do the bug head one. Right. Well, the book. The bug head one. We've talked a lot about animals and aren't we without heads? Surprisingly, we have, I think, a disproportionate amount on it. If you're a new listener, this is the first time you listen. You'll be surprised. We've covered worms the way, if you cut the red off, it grows back. If you don't cut too. Too high above its neck. We've covered the chicken. The fellow who blinked. Yeah. I can't go into it again. Right. Let's not go into it again. We've had the chicken. We know ed that lived for eight months. Yeah. And we've had cockroaches living for a week without an Ed. Right, okay. It's a bit more on the cockroach front, really. They found, right, that if you get a cockroach. Yeah. And you cut its head off. Yeah. Right. And then you find a cockroach that's still got its head, but it hasn't got any legs. Right. Right. It's not over for both of them. Right. Because what you can do, you get the one that's got the legs. Right. With no head sort of running around. Get the one with the head. Sit on top of it. Right. Get a little tube. Okay? So that the fluids. So is this. Is this. Aunties go out of the room. This is like Blue Peter. You get this for Christmas, right? You get a little tube. You set that on top. So the bodily fluids are still running between the two. Right. The head of the one on the top will control the feet of the one on the bottom. Okay. What about. Good. And will it continue to live? Yeah. Okay. You don't know that for sure, do you? That was just a question that the blue wasn't expecting. What do you think of that? Good. Yes. Great. Yeah. Just a primitive nervous system that can. Yeah. Yeah. Did you expect us to be more impressed and excited by that? What, do you fall off your chair when you read that? Did you think you're gonna be the Frankenstein of the insect world? Yeah. I just was thinking, if they can do that, you know, can they do it with humans? Because I also did a bit of research. Did you ever. Did you come to the sort of conclusion that apart from the moral aspect of it, that the human was probably more complicated than. Yeah, but, you know, I mean, things move on, don't they? Science, Rick. You know, I had been atone as a kid. Now they've got PlayStation two. And the difference in ten years if, if you lose your head, the cockroach can live normally on your body, but not the other way around. Your head on its cannot control his legs because it's too complicated for your brain. So. Yeah. So then, then other research, because I thought, if you don't learn from that, I'll give you something else for free. Right. That they can clone people. The only reason they don't do it, right, say if like Ricky needed a lung, right, they could clone you and make you the same. But the only reason they don't want to do it is because it'd be a bit horrible on it and it would turn. It would take sort of 18 years for me to get an adult lung. And there's all kinds of moral implications. Yeah. Sorry. So because lest we forget, Rick, he ended with, the only reason they don't do it is because it's a bit horrible than that. Which scientists said. That's not it. That's not the other one. No, no, no, that was. That was just, you know, we've got. Another one to come. Oh, I can't wait. The headline again. What was the headline? The headline. Oh, what a cat Tolstruffy. Looking forward to that mark. Yeah, a bit more title. This is from his covers album. This is called Snowbird. He's so happy that the x and m listeners understand his stupid clues and he knows it annoys me. The answers. Just quickly, just in case someone sort of missed one of them, I'll just quickly do them. Yeah, go on. First one. There's a load. There's a load of letters there asking for advice. Put them on Claire's desk. Oh, Merry Christmas. Ask your mom if you should. Oh, and Merry Christmas. A couple of people were arguing in the supermarket. It was Christmas and that's b. Okay, we'll give those answers out shortly. Yeah. I just have to show you something, Rick, before we move on. I know we've got another educating ricky, but someone just sent this in. They've been looking on eBay for Victoria Plum. You're joking. Come here and see the photograph. Oh, God, that's fantastic. Oh, God, he got that freeze. It's the worst piece of tat I've ever seen. Oh, carl, imagine how gutted. Imagine how. Think of him now. Right, there it is. I tell you, it looks like a diddy man gone wrong. It looks like a diddy man prostitute. That is. A different color at a yellow app. Mine. How do they get. Tell them they go into eBay, so. You need to log on to eBay co dot Uk. I'm sure you've used it before. It's the online marketplace e bay co uk. And if you type in victoria plum, I'm assuming that you can. That's amazing. The worst piece of rubber. Just think how cute he was as a kid though, doing that. Just think of him just going, gnomes. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. I mean, to be fair, I mean, I don't know what her price collection of gnomes looks like, but I can't imagine they're much better than that. I mean gnomes are fairly grotesque thing, but certainly your mum's taste and discretion is. Did you have any, did you ever. Those houses on your state, you'd go in there and it was just loads of those dolls still in their packaging all around the room and sort of like one of those homes that keeps the sort of packaging on, the three piece suite. Why don't you buy another one for her for Christmas? Yes, it's 399 it looks. But that's two pounds 49 because that was $3. Oh, buy it, Carl. So I've sorted out our passport this year anyway, I'll get her that next year. Okay. So, educating Ricky of the year. Oh, what a cat toast. Yeah, let's do that. Then there's this woman, right? Yeah, this woman, she's reading Guinness Booker records, yeah. And she's flicking through and she notices that there's a world record for a cat, right, with 27 toes. So she reads it and she thinks, well that's not right because her cat's got 28. What do you mean your cat's got. 28 cats got 28 toes. So she was like, well, hang on a minute, mine should be in there. So I missed the very beginning of this. She was. The woman with a cat with 28 toes looking through and it said the record for the cat's toes was 27. She thought, hold on, hold on a minute, Ross McWhorter, my cat's got one more than that cat. So go on. Anyway, so she said, you know, the person doing the interview with her said, you know, is it happy? And she said, yeah, yeah, you know, she's great and it's really good in the snow, right. It gets through a lot of nail varnish. Well, yeah, that's, that's what he said, right? He said it's really good in the snow. So I just was thinking, I mean, that's it really. That's not it. That's the end of that story. Brilliant. But what I'm thinking is, right, it. Was two cats welded together. No, she. She said, you know, it's happy. So is the other sort of disabilities where in a way it's not all bad. Oh, no. Do you know, like that book Steve brought in for me and there was a fella there, one, he had three legs. He was a juggler. And I was like, what's the point of that? What's the point of that? What's the point of what? Taking advantage of having three legs. Is he being. He said he should be a footballer, right? No, but in a way he's used it, hasn't. He's probably not even that good at juggling. But because he's got three legs, people have gone, well, give him a chance. Let's go and see him anyway. See if he's any good. Yeah. Right. So what I'm thinking is, is he. Anything else? We've mentioned the midgets today who are good at robbing cars because they can get through the windows like jukes advisors. Sorry, sorry. So listen, listen. I just like to say, this is the radio authority listening. We are in no way suggesting that one midget forte in life is robin cars. Or if you're immediate, sitting at home feeding service, I think you should go out robin cars. I just say, this is Carl Pilkington talking. The views of Carl Pilot, those of XFM or us. Yeah. It was a tv program, so it's not me. I'm just saying what I've seen on. But you did see that somebody told me about. Yeah. Just so you could be wrong. Just like a lot of your spurious fats you just see on the Internet. You know, I'm just saying. Yeah. So is he. Anything else? We've seen that fellow with three. So what you're saying is, is there a disability that is actually an advantage? Yeah. Right. Okay. Steve mentioned about the disabled, Lou, they're always really roomy and like, got multi gyms facilities in them. Multi gym facilities? What do you mean? Bars everywhere. And that's not parallel bars. I'm just. I'm just saying, though, do you know? I mean, so in a way they've. They've got that. So always. What I'm saying is, when you look on the brighter side, my elephant man would have never got up and gone, oh, look at me hair today. Nor do you know, but. Would never have that problem. You're a maniac. Forget it. I thought we'd be able to get a serious discussion going here. Well, okay then. So this is a serious discussion, is it? Okay, well, let's treat it sensitively and if you really want a serious discussion and talk about whether there are some disabilities, our advantage. Let's think of some then, shall we? Well, I've said three already. Yeah. You can't say if you're deaf. Bobby Davra won't annoy you. That doesn't count as an advantage. Do you understand? Do you know what I mean? Carl's looking at you thinking, that's brilliant. Yeah, yeah. We'll leave it, then. I'll come up with a better feature for next year. Like that was gonna be a feature. What, you were hoping that that would be a spin off feature. Disability, sir. Actually form of. Do we need them? It's like. That's called think of it. It's like that. It's like that joke bloke that as is wakes up in hospital, says good news and bad news. Bad news is we've had to amputate both legs. What's the good news? The fellow in the next bed wants to buy your slippers. See, that's not an advantage, it's a joke. That doesn't really happen. People don't go, oh, that is good news. Yeah, I'll probably get a quid firm, do you know what I mean? But the fellow with 3ft, what would he do? Well, he'd buy a pair and then just nick one of those. Because they put out one shoe, don't they? Are those. Yeah. If you've got one leg, you can nick shoes. Good point, Carl. Now I'm getting you thinking. Yeah. Right, so we'll do rockbusters on today next, then Christmas wars over and all that. Indeed. Brilliant. Brilliant tune. Great. You and I've had a great time. I had a great time. Merry Christmas, everybody. I hope we haven't offended you by some of Carl's rantings. Just think of. Just. Just think of what he's gone through in his life. Victoria. Plum incident. Carl, I've got a little gift for you here before we go. Well, no, you've got your girlfriend. Anything. It's not. It's not exciting, but it's worth taking. In fact, you could. Why don't you just regift that straight away? Cheers for that. Yeah. Don't even look to it. That's not the champagne we got free from the BBC, is it? It's not, actually, no, Rick, because that is far too good for the likes of Carl. Oh, right. And I wasn't good. To me. You wouldn't appreciate it. That's just sparkling. Oh, but I love that. Yeah. I'm seeing Carl on Christmas day because, uh, he's around Christian London. So I'll get a little giffen. Carl. All right, that'd be good. When? It'd be a nice little. Okay. Answers we must give you. We'll have to go to bed at six, though, so we. Right, here's the last clues of the year you had. Uh, there's a load of letters there asking for advice. Put them on Claire's desk. Go on. That was for foreigner. For Raina. I don't even. Clair Rainer. She took advice. She gave people advice. So that's a foreigner. That is shit, right? I'm sorry. Maybe Christmas. That is absolute dark. A lot of people got the right answer. I know. Well, that annoys me even more. Number two. Second one. Ash. Your foreigner. Yeah, foreigner. Second one. Ask your mom if you should. That was s. That was Shalamar. Shalomar, right. No, bizarrely, what was the clue there? Ask your mom if you should. Now, we got a lot of people saying smashing pumpkins as the answer to that. I don't know who's saying that today. Mum. Smashing pumpkins. Merry Christmas, mom. Thank you very much. Nice wallet. Oh, that's great. That's great. Smashing pumpkins. Your dad bought them for me for Christmas. Yeah. And the last one, lovely plums. What am I, victorious? Oh, God. We've got. We gotta wrap it up. Come on. Then a couple of people were arguing in the supermarket at the fruit and veg. That was b. That was banana drama. We're like, I'm gonna. Drama? What group is banana drama? What group is banana drama? You're a fool, you twat, when you say that. But you accuse her. You accused Karl of that. You're also accusing lots of listeners, including the winner, Nicola Rogers of London. And she wins those great prizes and she got them bang on. So. So can we finish there now? Yeah. What do you mean? What do you mean? Can we finish there now? Just play the ads and go. What are you talking about? We're gonna play that then. Goodness. Merry Christmas, Carl. Let's give a little kiss. Christmas.",
