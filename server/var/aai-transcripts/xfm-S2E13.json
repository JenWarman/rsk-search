  "text": "Foo fighters. All my life on XFM 104.9, I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington. Indeed. Genius. Carl Pilton, as Heat magazine said. Really? Is that what you refer to now? Yeah, yeah. Genius saying about people tuning just to hear his games, such as educating Ricky. Have you got some educating Ricky for me? I need some education, Carl. I desperately need some education. I want to learn about chinese kids that are born hairier than average. I want to hear about deaf girls that can hear after their mum hits their head against a wall. These are the things I need to know. I mean, I don't wish to be disrespectful. He doesn't look like a genius. He doesn't like genius. Looks like. Exactly. I don't want to be enough. Look at Einstein. Yeah, yeah. His mom thought he was mental as a child. Where'd you get that information from? That was in the Einstein book. Then it's really true. Which Einstein book is that? Relative? The big book of Einstein stuff. Oh, yeah, yeah. The big bumper book of Einstein stuff. Is for a coach trip and you. Have to fill in equals mc, one squared, two fish or three. Hello. And then it's multiple choice and you feel it's great. It is not. Think a, he's a genius. So most people go for a, but is in fact b. She thought he was mental the age of 28. Oh, Carl, you never let me down. You never let me down. So have you got educating Ricky for me? Educating Ricky coming up. You got rockbusters? We've got rockbusters. Great. As seen and talked about in heat. It's got really tough this week. Now we're not messing about anymore. Got some good prizes. Absolutely, yeah. We'll talk about those later. Because, I mean, was it last week that you had the classic? Was it? I can't remember. I'm paraphrasing, Carl, apologies. Something like, I'm here in Texas, I've fallen in a puddle and my knee has got wet. Yeah. Whitney Houston. Whitney Houston. Whitney Houston. Yeah. So it was last week when there was a little bit of confusion over the one for Holly Valance. Of course. I don't think it was confusion. I think it was your error. No, it wasn't. And it was holy valance. And you meant pelmet. Ah. Then Becky, who called up that time and said, oh, if you. You get mistaken with pelmet. Right. She sent me an email in a week saying, I've done a bit of research, it was my fault. I've made an error. Yeah, it is a valance, okay? And I know about valances. As I told you last week at the very end, me auntie loves them. Yeah, right. She. She makes them. She started off just like putting them on top of the window around the curtain, and then she thought, oh, I can do more with this. And she had a little coffee table that had magazines underneath and she said, I'm sick of seeing them magazines when I'm sat down. She sounds like a pilkington. I'm sick of seeing the magazines when I sit down. So she put a valance around the table. Then next step, she tapes everything. She never actually watches telly. She tapes it all. She gets sick of listening to the adverts, Matt. Yeah. So she tapes everything. She's got loads of videotapes and that. And the video used to get on her nerves when she was watching a film. She'd see the clock changing. Oh. And it distract her from the film. So she felt a valance. That's genius. Yeah. Or is it mental? I don't know. She's even made a little Jack Russell look like a hovercraft. So everything's got a balance. If you go round and you stand still for too long, the chances are. This is that this is Auntie who in Nora. And this is the one that fires five minutes less, lest our listeners forget. Five minutes. Called his mum saying, I'm farting two minutes into the fart. She said, about two and a half minutes in. She said, I'm about two and a half minutes. Said, well, it was about two and a half minutes before I called you. Yeah. And then it went on for a further two, two and a half minutes or something. And then it stopped. She couldn't. She couldn't talk about it because there was a balance over the clock. Yes. She used to annoy her when she was on the phone. You put her off. Seeing the time. She was guessing it was five minutes. This was one consistent fight. Yeah. I mean, it wasn't making a noise, it was just. It was making a noise. Just gas. Endless gas. So that's fantastic. Well, we started off with a new one. Little bit of foo fighters. We like new and old on this show, don't we? Like to mix it up. I'd like to play to Smith's from there, from their debut album. I don't owe you anything. I don't owe you anything. The lads from Carl's hometown. Indeed, the Smiths. Brilliant, that one. Wow. I went to Manchester United the other day. Went to Manchester for the corporate. It was all right. He went and wait till you get out, you see, because it's better than Houston. Right. It was. You know, it was. It was nicer. I went outside and there was a ridiculous queue and sort of one cab. Right, yeah. So horse drawn. Yeah. And so I walked. It was okay. It was only down the road a bit dark. It was wet and raining, of course, the north. I know, yeah. The hotel was very nice, but no minibar. I've never seen that before. I've traveled all over the world to the hotel without a mini bar. So I don't know what's going on then. I know what is going on there. And then I did this corporate gig in Old Trafford. The pitch was up, don't. They were doing. But, you know, very impressive. Big impressive, I think, the british football club, aren't they, Kyle? Yeah. You did a gig at where? Old Trafford. It was in a function room stadium. No, no, I'm not that big. Yeah. No, but I mean, you know, I can't really comment on Manchester. I do know that Liverpool was voted most important music city via parliament, so. Carl, you're making noises while I'm talking. Yeah. But you do this all the time, trying to wind me up. And I'm not. I'm not saying Manchester is the best place in the world, but what I'm saying is there's bits of it that I really miss. Yeah. Like last Sunday, right, when I'd met up with Ricky, we had a spaghetti polar names, which was all right. And then I said to her, I said, I need some soil. Damn, I wish you'd invited me. It sounds so. They need some soil. What do you think? You need? Somewhat soil. So, yeah, I need to repot a plant. Right, yeah. So you need to repot a plant. Yeah, fair enough. So I'm like, where? You can't see these shops in London. I mean, there's nothing. I took him straight to one in my street. Yeah, but near your street. And that's probably the only one in London. Well, you say that, Carl. No, it does annoy me around my way. It's like, you know, you can't move for soil shops. You can just pick up the hand walking down the street. Incredible people just lead over into someone's front garden. Take the plants. Yeah. What I'm saying is. Go on, Manchester, there's loads of decent hardware shops. Yeah. Here, you know, if you are a panini in a latte or whatever, you can't move from. But for soil, I had to go virtually how many miles away from me to carry that soil home and stuff. Yeah. It's not good. I mean London's all right, but if cities were sort of. It's neglecting the peat market. Really? Well, there's barely, I mean there's barely any mulch available in central London. I'm sick and tired of not getting a good decent compost of a Sunday. So I'm thinking of moving to the north where there is loads of soil and gravel and animal shite, whatever. Yeah. So. So you were gonna say if you're marking cities out of ten, what would you give London? Well, if you were marking them on like, you know, on what they have. Right. As opposed to what? Well, as opposed to. How do you spell it? I think the greatest city in the world is Rome. Pretty amazing. Yeah. Have you been? What? Yeah. Why do you think that though? Just because like you turn a corner and there's something there that's really old. Right. Like you're going down normal street. Go stay in a derby and Joan club. Yeah. No, no, no. But, but it's like you're going down the road and then you turn a corner and the coliseum's in the middle of a. Like a busy road. It's like what's that doing there? Yeah. Yeah. And just when you think there's no more, you turn another corner. It's almost as if that was their first. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. But you know, I mean, London. Yeah. What have we got? You know, Trafalgar Square is world sort of world known. And you go there. What's that? Yeah. Do you know what I mean? So there's a lot of space there. Get one big b and Q, intra focus. Great. So cater for the whole of people who live sort of central London ish. Yeah, yeah. And then I'd be happy. But what I'm saying with Nelson just. Popping up through the middle because you can still see it, couldn't you? Yeah, yeah, it's a great. So B and Q could be like the whole sort of flat thing and make it sort of gray so it looked like rock. And then Nelson. Make it classy is what you say. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Stone clad it. So it looks like you've made an effort and then you can pop in and you can go out and go, look, Nelson's column. Oh, look at that. Isn't Nelson. Oh, look at that. The victory. Defeat us. Fantastic. One of the greatest living. Yeah. I need some nails. Yeah, perfect. Kim. Two bridge, one story. But why don't. Why isn't there more than. More than them shops. Because when I went into yours, every time I've been in there, I've been in there twice now. The first time was to get a shower head. Right? Right. And I went in there, couldn't resist buying something else. I ended up getting some superglue as well. Hey, big spender. And then last Sunday we went in there, got two bags of soil. Not one, about two. Yeah. Bought some scissors to cut plants with. Secretaires. Well, you don't. You never know when you want, you know, you might need more soil, I suppose. Well, I've got. Where'd you keep under your. Sorry. This isn't going out, is it? This composite, it's not going out on air. I can't feel it might be. You're joking. We've better play a record. Okay. Play a classic. I hate to say I told you so on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, obviously, with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Genius Pilkington. Absolutely. I was watching Carl the brain Pilkington. The brain. Brains. I was watching it tv last night. Rick gone and I had little need. No, I didn't watch children need. I think it was last night was bit earlier. I don't thought for lads that might be out tonight, you know, on the. On the raz. Yeah. Maybe they get a little bit success with the ladies. Yeah. This was something that struck me as I was watching it. A lot of gentlemen, you know, when they're. When they're engaged in, you know, an act of, you know, relations with a lady, they like to sort of, you know, think of an image or something that will prevent them from, you know, and you get. You catch my drift? We're men in the world. Grandmother's funeral is a cliche, isn't it? Exactly. And I'll tell you what. What? I think it should be Rick Waller jogging. I was watching fit club. I have never seen anything. I liked it when Harvey lost it with him. Oh, man alive. I mean, I know I slag him off, but I do. I don't really like him either. I just think he comes across appallingly. And I think, you know, when he. Just walked away, when that mid conversation, talking to that bloke. They're doing it for his good, really. But he's. He's, he's how? He's like 30 1 st. I think he lost a bit. I think he's 29. Now. Don't exaggerate, Steve. You make him sound like a fat. But, um. But, you know, it was close, wasn't it? When having sex, you know, apparently thinking of Rick. Rick Waller helps. Oh, don't look. What's happened exactly. Oh, no. Me and Kyle, if you're with a lady. If you're with a lady, that works. I know. He's out now, Eddie. He's out. Did he walk out? I think so. I think that's it from what I can. No, no, I think next week to kick him out, because I read something about to get rid of him next week because of his attitude. And first time I read it, I thought he'd actually ate someone's hat. Everything you think of now is puns. You can't get puns out of your head, can you? Oh, God, you're great. Look at his little face. He's so. How long ago? You're working on that. You gotta love. You've gotta give him that. That was a real joke. Look at his face. He knew it was funny. It was meant to be funny. He said it to be funny and it was well done. I. Well, I'm just interested. I just want to dissect it because it was brilliant. And I'm wondering, how long you working on it? About two weeks. There's only one band that can top that. Another band from Manchester. Oh, Isis Vines, misses Jackson on XFM 104.9. Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Right, getting towards that time where Carl really kicks into action. We've got the quiz. We've got rock busters. The quiz. That's a bit like blockbusters, but mainly around music. Yeah, and a pun scenario based in word play by Carl. You know how good he is at that. Can I tell you what the prizes are this week? Because they're worth playing for. Please do. Okay, we got on DVD the Manic street Preacher's greatest hits. On DVD, the videos I was the film Human Traffic. It's a remix DVD version of that, I think. We were giving this away last week. You've obviously got a bulk stock of these. Groov. Armada's love box. An album from them. The best air guitar album in the world ever. That's got the likes of Queen, Adams, Palmer, Leopard Idol. I don't see any. Smith should be on there. We've got purple Wolf, Cooper Top and back. Nickelback. There was another one, actually. I seem to have lost one of the prices. Car. Oh, here we are. Yeah, this is. You might see this advertised on tv. The best bands ever album. And just. Just imagine who this is aimed at. It's got Oasis on their nickelback. Coldplay, that it. The Dandy Warhols, bohemian like you in brackets, as featured in the Vodafone tv ads. Then it's smash mouth walking on the sun. As featured in the Ford Fiesta tv ads. It's for people who didn't know they liked indie. Exactly. Exactly. I don't like indie. But you do. Do you like this advert? Yeah. Do you like this advert? Yeah. Well, you like indie then? I do. I love indie. Don't believe it. That's great. The mock turtles. Can you dig it? As featured in the Vodafone TV ads. I really like indie. Do you love the T mobile tv ad? Yeah. You'll love this. It's got Royce cup on there, which. Is featured in there. So that's. That's an album for people who don't like music. That's great. That's kind of rockbusters. But I also have a movie because, you know, last week I gave away executive decision. Yeah, that was on tv last night. Yeah. Receive my copy. But they probably watched it before last night. I found another one, which might be just to entice people. Gone. What is it? It's coming out the bag. The pelican brief. Oh, another arbitrary film choice on VHS brief. Roberts or Washington? You know, VHS. VHS is around 699. I'm giving that away. That's great. And that's his personal collection. That's from my personal collection. Did you see that gum picture? Cardboard. I don't think it's even rewind from when I watched it. Really. No, it's not. You can rewind that yourself. Brilliant. That's a little touch of Steve match in there. Did you see that picture that you bought in? I have actually gone see it again, Carl. Yeah. It's just a picture. This is. You carry it with you. Do you know what else? He found it last week. I was sorting it because I'm moving. I'm sorting all me files out on that. And because this is the only school. Picture, one school picture taken when he was that. 10 19 81. Okay, tell the story. Why is that the only school picture I've taken? Just because. No, I had them all. I was always Adam taken. Right. But my dad thought they were overpriced for what you get. Because, really, you said that they have that sort of. The whole idea of a good picture is like, not only the person that's in it, but. But like, the surroundings. Yeah. So, like, if you're on holiday, it'll look at me and I'll go, oh, yeah, you're looking well. What's that hill in the background? Or something like that, whereas with Rick Waller. Catch it up. But all you get on these school pictures is like a blue background in it. So it was like, I'm not. I'm not paying for that. Sure. And it was a big one. You get a bigger one than that. But that's just like a little passport size in it. Yeah. Yeah. That was one pound 60. He wasn't really happy paying that because he said you could get like some done from true print for a lot. He could take himself. Yeah. So that was the last time he was playing for a school. He said, I'll get you one because it's good to have a picture of you at school. Yeah. Because they hardly ever went and all that. What's that in the background? That's my school, Dad. I don't recognize it. Any interesting stories about it? Not really. So I was good looking kid, though. What are you doing with your mouth though, Carl? It looks like you're sort of. It looks like a bit like you're a ventriloquist dummy. What do you mean? Well, it looks like you're sort of scrunching your mouth up or piercing your lips or something. Do you not think? I mean, now you've got, dare I say it, very kissable lips. Look how thin they are. Look at those little thin lips. It's like you. I'm smiling. That's a smile. Oh, that's what. I didn't recognize that either. Is that what you look like when you smile? Oh, what's happening with the head? Seen you smile before then. Well, I think that's why he wanted to buy one as well. That's like, so he can remember what it was like. When did you stop smiling? When did you. When was the last time you had fun? And you slightly like a happy go lucky. When. When can you remember when you had no weight of the world on your shoulders? I often think that because I don't sleep like I did. Like when I was. When I was a kid, I had really good sleeps and now I don't. Right. So I think why? You've got a lot of things on your mind. Where can I buy soil? Yeah. How can I confuse a computer? By tapping in y in the search engine? Probably when I was 14. I was stress free. Were you? Yeah. When was the paper round? Probably when I was 15. Right. That's when it started, was it? I reckon that's when I started getting stressed. Yeah. I'm just looking at the haircut you've got in the. Because obviously I've not seen you before. With hair. And it's an interesting mop. Um, did you. Do you have that done at Barbara's? No, my mum. Mum used to do it. She got. Yeah, right. What she used to do, you can't see in that picture, but there was one where she did a bit of a mess of it. I mean, it looks quite. I can't tell from this picture. That's one of the better ones. Oh, really? Yeah. Were you bullied much. On one of them? She used to, like, use a better newspaper in front of me. I. So she didn't like sticky scissors in my eyes. Newspaper stop scissors every time. Yeah, because I think they use that for bulletproof vest. Yeah. The type. The tough fabric of a reconstituted newspaper will stop the scissor anytime. No, definitely. I remember it because I know a lot of un guys, when they're on patrol, they use some old copies of the sun. So she used to. Used to always be on a Sunday night when, like, songs appraise is honestly nothing. Was on the telly just before last summer wine. She used to get the. What a depressing time that was. It was your haircut and listening to songs appraise waiting for last summer wine. Yeah. I was used to get depressed on Sunday night. Well, I tell you, it wasn't because school was the next morning, it was because the telly was so shy. I think it was because school was next morning, because Antiques Roadshow still does that for me. I see. The antiques roadshow, I love it. But I'm just thinking, I'll go to school or work tomorrow. Yeah, the roadshow. I wish they put on the weekend. I know. I've never. I've never really had that when I worked. I suppose I work now. No. Oh. Sorry. You were telling a story. So anyway, so you get the newspaper, right? And she'd stick it in front of me eyes and what does that say? Go on. So she. You inherited a lot from your mum, didn't you? She'd cut me fringe. Right? Yeah. Well, then she'd go, oh, it's not straight. Not very good. So she'd go again and she keep going. Is that what you're baldness? I was to say is this, that you have got hair, but she has to get it right. It takes her to the back of your neck to get it even. She sort of removed the newspaper and she was like, oh, God. I said, what? She goes, oh, I'm sorry. And like, what? Did this happen every Sunday? Can I ask you, Carl, when she was cutting your hair in this picture, which do you think? She was maybe sidetracked by an interesting article in the paper and really wasn't paying attention. So, yeah, I ended up with, like, you know, fringe, sort of on the back of the head, because she just kept going further and further. Sure, but when did you start going to that barber that was on the railway station? Must have. That's when I started work, so, you know, sort of 1617. And is he the one that said you have the hair of a chinaman? He's the one, yeah. He sounds like a wise man. Well, can I just stop? Maybe we should play a tune, but maybe you could bring in some photos next week, Rick, and we can talk about them on the radio. Yeah, and I'm just gonna do a card trick, right. Take any card. Yeah, right. Look at it. Boy with the arab strap. Bell and Sebastian. Coming next. Educating Ricky. You, too, electrical storm. Steve, am I mental or. We've been playing some great tunes. We've been playing some great tunes. You're not mental. Yeah. Our next fa. Wonderful. With an archer, gervaise, would be Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl Pilkerton in the chair. Now, the talked about the acclaimed educating Ricky. Right. Well, just in case anyone's new doesn't normally listen, basically I'm educating Ricky. Do a bit of research in a week. Find stuff, news, history, anything that's interesting. Three stories are given, a nice little headline. You take your pick. Between now and three, you're going to learn three things. Yeah. So the headlines are. I'll be no buying one of them. Give us that again. I'll be no buying one of them. Nice. Okay. We've also got hippa Potter news. Okay. And chicken, you believe it? Chicken. You believe it? Well, I'll talk to hippopotamus. Hippopotamus, right. Well, this one, it's. I'm not going to take the credit here. I heard Christian talking about this on breakfast. Right. Because it's a good, good, good story that happened, basically. I don't know if I told you about it last week when we're having our spaghetti, but I think you did. I know what it is. I've not heard this. There's a little midget. I've loved it already. Circus going on somewhere? I think it was in America. Is that present day or old times? I'm talking, like, in the last three weeks. Okay. Right. Little midget circus really packed out. Show people are loving it. Steve, you're asked the same question I did. I know. So there's little midget jumping up and down on a trampoline. So everyone's clapping and he's getting carried away. Because he can't believe he's like, they're loving it. I didn't know they'd like a little person on a trampoline. But they love me. But you know what it's like when if there's a crowd of people sort of encouraging you to sort of go higher and stuff. Yeah. And I'm sure he knew he was, it was getting out of hand, but he was jumping and he was coming down the road going higher and he's going really high in the air. Right. So he's, he's doing this. Crowd are clapping. There's a hippo, right, just sat next to the trampoline getting ready to come on and do his act. Oh, right. I thought he was in the audience. Invite the trampoline waiting to do his app because it's why they sit in the dressing room and they go, five minutes, Mister Musk. Five minutes, mister Mus. So anyway, right, so the hippo's there. He's getting annoying. Is he? Because this, because the midgets, how can I follow this? This is really annoying. They're going to be, oh no. So he's thinking, he's already done the trampoline. My pogo stick act is never going to work. Yeah. It can't wait. See, it's a great story and I just know he embellishes it or gets slightly wrong. Go on. So, so there's a midget jumping up and down. The hippo's getting annoyed. The crowd are going mad. The midgets loving it. Can't believe his luck. Although we think, you think he probably knows he's dicing with danger. Yeah. Yeah. So next thing you know, they're all saying, hi. Hi. It gives it one big like heavy sort of landing on the trampoline. Goes really high but goes off at a funny angle. Oh, hypotenuse. Okay. Yeah. And sort of flies up, flies off at a funny angle. Hippos there swallows him whole. Crowd are clapping thinking that's why the hippo is waiting there. Rubbish. Rubbish. It's not rubbish. No. Maybe there was an accident in a circus with a midget and a hippo. But at no point was this hippo waiting to go on going, come on. The midget flew off at hypotenuse and landed in the hip hop, his mouth and was swallowed whole. This is, this is what you embellish it. That is great. I have to say though, Rick, when I heard midget trampoline, hippopotamus. I was thinking, actually waiting to happen. Yeah. So, yeah, maybe. I mean, you should never put those three together. Never. It's. It's a recipe for disaster. Everyone knows that. Midget, trampoline, hippopotamus. Are you mental? Ill ask you for trouble. Well, you know, when he told me it, he said, and the midget, he didn't. He didn't mention hippopotamus. And he said, the midget went on and soon he fell off and the hippo at him. And I said, sorry, what was the hippo doing there? He went, it's a circus. I've never heard of a circus having a hippo. What do hippos do? What can they do? You can't train them. Are they like, very deadly? They're huge. You can't have a hippo in a circus. Hey, sure you're not thinking of Zippo? He's neither kind. Yeah, no, you know, it wasn't. It wasn't. It wasn't some sort where Zippo was eating a midget and it's. It's some sort of horrible sexuality. No, it was definitely on breakfast. Right. Oh, okay. Sorry. No, it's definitely. Okay, good. Well, let's play a record then. I'd like to play a classic Springsteen. We're both fans of Springsteen there. This might be his debut album. I'm not sure. Greetings, raspberry PI, New Jersey. And this is growing up. It's great. It's classic Springsteen and growing up off of Ashby park album. Great. They make you feel good. Springs a joy. He's an absolute joy. Rockbusters. This is what they're all reason and writing about. Absolutely. Before you get the clues, let me just remind you of the prizes you're playing for. We've got the manic street preacher's greatest hits on DVD. We've got the film human traffic on DVD. We've got the best air guitar album, two on CD. Groov Armada's. Is this their current album? Yeah, I guess. It's not selling very well. They're still trying to promote that. You can have that as well. If you are a fan of the Ford Fiesta TV ad of the Vodafone TV adverts, you will love the. You didn't think you liked Indy. Well, you do. Exactly. And that's got feeder and Travis and badly drawn boy and all sorts on there. Plus my own copy, 699. It cost me the Pelican brief starring Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington. If you've not seen that panned and scanned on VHS. So what news Pelican. I read the other day that has to turn its head upside down to eat. Give us the clues. So, rockbusters. Well, let me just explain. A bird. A bird has a gullet and esophagus and a gullet is all in one thing. It hasn't got peristalsis, which is the movement that we have that can make food. So a bird can only rely on gravity, so it has to have its head up and has to shake. It can't eat. You were going to say that, weren't you, Carl? Yeah, yeah. So, rock busters, you mentioned it earlier. One of last week's was, it's a cryptic clue and then some initials. I was in Texas, I fell in a puddle on my knees. Knees got wet. Wh. Wet knee, Houston. That's the sort of thing we use. Of the word knee twice there in the cryptic clue and in the final. And the word wet. Which is wit. So, fine, good. So there's three of them. It's email only. Ricky Gervaisfm dot co dot uk. Load of stuff to win. Here they go. Right. The first one writing these down. Go on making it. Um. The fella has only got one badge left. The fella has only got one badge left. What are the initials? That's just e. Just e. Just e. The fella has only got one badge left. This is either a solo artist or a band. Yeah. Second one, the unmarried lady is a friendly out with. Say that again. The unmarried lady is a friend I eat out with. The unmarried lady is a friend I eat out with. Yeah. Md. Md, m, D. And finally. I really, I really, really love that woman. I love everything she does. That's m. Excuse that one again. I really, really love that woman. I love everything she does. And that's m. I know I've got that one right. That's lovely. So that's great. I think. I think that the second and third ones, quite easy. First one is a killer. Is it tricky? Yeah, it's a tricky one. So, Ricky Gervais, XFM dot co dot uk. And what we pick a winner out at about quarter two or two? Yeah, absolutely. No, quarter three. Quarter three, yeah. So there you go. That's dynamite stuff. Well done, Carl. More educating Ricky next. Yeah. Back lost cause on XFM 104.9. Wow, Carl. We haven't had a lot of emails. They're tough. I'm struggling. I've got one and I, I'm struggling with two, but I know one of the words. But I can't think of the band that fits it. Unless the clues wrong and I've got no idea with the first one. E. Give us quickly recap. Number one, the fellow has only got one badge left. That's e. Second one, the unmarried lady's a friend. He out with. That's Md. And the last one, I really, really love that woman. I love everything she does. That's m. Well, Ricky, what is it? Ricky. Ricky Gervais. Ffm dot co dot UK. So keep those coming in. If there's no winner, we don't know whether to give it to the person who gets the most right first or have a massive rollover. And what a Christmas booty that would be, as Carl said, all those. Imagine what you could have. Indecent proposal, maybe. Who knows? You know what I mean? I've got some real junk, so I can bring that in. Yeah, it the mean machine. Imagine someone is Christmas. Yeah, exactly. This Christmas. I can't believe I thank you so much for the pelican brief. I know she left the price on. And it's on VHS as well. Oh, great. Brilliant. So perfect Christmas gifts. Yeah, it's great. Okay, now, um, so that's going, that's going, that's going on. That's a big, big, big prize. It's a big weekend prize on XFM. Educating Ricky, part two. Right, what's the. What's the clues left with? We've got. Left the headlines. I'll be no buying one of them. Yeah. And we've also got chicken. You believe it? Chicken. You believe it? So they're the two that are left. Which ones you wait for chicken. You believe. It is not that picture, is it that we saw? Which picture? The bloke with it. No. Okay. God, that was bad. Right, okay, so explain. We can't really discuss this on it, can we? Well, we can. Steve brought in Carl the best book ever. Which is. What is it? I found it when I was moving house. It's an FHM publication. It's kind of like lots of grotesque pictures and stories and, like the book of the Book of freaks and weirdos. And Carl opened it and the first one was like, well, you couldn't believe, you luck. What was it? What was. What was number 50? A bloke with two heads. And he said, what's number one? Yeah. And then number six, there's a bloke who's a squid or some octopus. Yeah, he's loving it at number one. He said, what's just a fella under a rock? And I went, oh, no, read on. I think I know about this. And it's the fella that was found. He caused a landslide while having sex with a chicken. And they pulled him off and there he is, the chicken. So Carl could not believe his luck. So it's not that chicken. You believe it? I love that one for that one. Yeah. Right, well, we've talked a lot on the show about. We talked a lot on the show. Yeah, yeah, yeah. About animals without heads. We talked about cockroaches could live without a head for seven days. Yeah, we talked about that. And then of course there was the. The well known one about the. The fellow who had his head cut off and he blinked and he said to his mate, count how many times a blink when my head comes off. Yeah. When you told it to me, you said his head came off and he said, quick, count how many times I blink. And it was Nick Frost. I had to go, no, Carl, no. He said it before I went and that was. That was lovely. So, yeah, we've talked quite a lot about things. Ed's coming off. Go on then. Well, this one. Yeah, back in 1945, he looked up. The date, got a specific date, make. Jonathan sent this one, you know him as well, at the BBC. Right. He emailed this one in. So thanks for that chicken. It's called Mike. There's a chicken coop. Sorry, I missed a bit there. There's a chicken called chicken. Cold, Mike. Okay, yeah. What happened was he was living on a farm, loads of chickens knocking about and the owner of the farm is like getting ready for tea and his wife says, go out and get a fresh chicken because my mum's going round. So he thinks, well, I want to get a good one in because what, impress her back then, even then they wanted to impress the mother in law on that. So they said, I'll just nip out and get one. So he sees Mike. Chicken running around. Just during the war, after the war. 1945, I'd say that was after. No, ended. Well, it ended in 1945. September gone. Yeah. So chickens running about. He thinks that one, look, you know, that looks alright. I love that one, Mike. He picks it up and he cuts his head off. Puts it on the block, cuts his head off. Runs about a bit like they do. He thinks it'll stop in a minute. Keeps running about what's going on here, right? He's now like chasing the chicken without an Ed. Yeah. Saying he should die in a minute anyway. Doesn't die. Chicken's walking around with no head. Lives for 18 months. Yeah. Chicken with no head. Yeah. What do you think of that? Well, I'll tell you, I've heard this story before, Rick, and the explanation, as I understand it, was that certain vital cords, spinal cords weren't severed when the head came off. So that was why it continued to. To live. Yeah. I don't know if that sounds plausible. It's fine. Absolutely fine. How did it take on protein and. Energy, the fella who owned it? He said, well, hang on a minute. He said I could. I could kill it now, but I've. Got a wonder chicken here. But he's thinking he must really want to live. Sure. If it survived that. They sort of got something here. Yeah. So we. What he does, he gets a little eyedropper thing that he used to use on it. Obviously not. Not anymore. Right. And he filled it with grain and water, and it had a big hole in its neck where its head used to be. Incredibly. And he dropped, you know what? This. This. I mean, that. That is possible then, if it, you know, without infection, if he is taking on things, it is. It is possible. Right. Why? What? Why did he do it? How cruel is that? I mean, that was not cruel because it. Chicken, obviously, you know, he said. He said if he thought it was a bit fed up, he would have killed it, he said. But he was running around quite happy. Well, it wasn't fed up at all because it had no brain. Well, what do you mean? Wow. I'm just saying. What? It was nothing. It was just. It was just sinew and nerves and electrical impulses breaking down energies. Right. That's all it was. It didn't have a brain. So it was. But I'm worried about the psychology of keeping a pet without a head. I'm worried more about what the farmer was thinking. I tell you this. What I'm. The question I'm asking is, was the mother in law impressed? I mean, that's why. That's why he's out of the shot. Mike's head. This is lovely, but it's just ahead where you don't kill a chicken like that all at once. I thought we were having chicken for dinner. Come and look at this. Running around the yard. Oh, dear. There you go. You've learned something there. Yeah, I have learned something. Yeah. Yeah. One more. That farmer. I've learned that farmer was very strange indeed. I have to say, to be fair to call, I've feeling like when I read it, the reason he kept it alive was as a novelty he sold, he got charged people to come and see the incredible headless chicken called Mike. Right, so here we are. That's great. So, tune Steve Attune. Yeah, I just thought I'd like to hear a little bit more from that nerd album. We played some of this from. From there when it first came out many, many moons ago. Since then, it's gone on, it's won awards, all sorts. And obviously nerd now, nerd, as I sometimes know, kind of big producers, they're producing Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, all kinds of people. But this is a track from their album. I've heard that they are indeed. And this is called things are getting. Better. Nerd from their album in search of. And that's. Things are getting better. After the break, we got more educating Ricky and the results to this week's rockbusters. And Richard Ashcroft. Oh, dynamite. Richard Ashcroft. Check the meaning of on XFM 104.9. Wicked advice will be Steve Merchant. Carl just remembered a little story he was excited to tell you. Okay, go on. Oh, are you gonna tell him? Oh, okay. When we went into this cafe last week, after Carl got his soil, we got two big bags of soils going, get a bag for me. And he was a knock and walk home. After about ten yards, he was going on my arms out, so he had to get a cab. So we stopped in his cafe. He had spaghetti bodied days. You're loving it, weren't you? It's good, it's good. Little day. And there's a woman that worked there and she saw. I could see her sort of looking at me and she. And then she came and said, are you off the telly? And I went, yeah, yeah. She went, yeah, Chris Miles. Oh, beautiful, beautiful. And I just laughed. And we both started laughing. She went, no, sorry, I don't know. I'm not. Because. What's your name? And I went. And I had to say it, I went, Ricky Gervaise. She went, oh, all the thing in the office. Oh, yeah, yeah. No, the only thing was she said. She went and said, oh, no, I saw you on Jonathan Ross. That's it. Yeah. She'd obviously watch the Jonathan Ross show, thinking Chris Miles has, you know, lost his looks a bit, or whatever. That's what I found funny, the fact. That she must think, yeah, yes, we know. I saw you like I saw you the other day. Yeah, yeah. She went, oh. And then we were still sort of laughing. I was thinking, she went outside, I was going, no, it's fine, it's fine. I was thinking, imagine that. Just like, great. There's not a better one to pick. That's just appalling. Oh, that was lovely. It's the second time as well that. You'Ve been mistaken for Chris Morris. Yeah, I've had miles, I've had Vegas. A few Johnny Vegas here. So people are going up to miles, going, you were. You don't think about working in office? Yeah, well. Don't know. I don't know whether I hope that or not. I don't know. It depends what he answers. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, I like that. I thought you were gonna say that. You Chris walls? No. What's your name? Ricky Jamaica. Never. So, yeah, okay, right, educating Ricky, number three. Well, we've got the emails in. We've got the emails in. Yeah. People are finally. They're finally trickling in. I think people have got the full three. Right. But, I mean, it's still worth emailing him because we never know who we're going to pick as a one. Tell you what, we've still got 50 minutes before we give the prize out, so let's give this. Give them again. Just give us a quick run there. Because I think these are. These are. These are tantalizing. They really are. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the first one, the fella has only got one badge left. Yeah. That's e. The second one, the unmarried lady, is a friendly out with Md. And the third one, I really, really love that woman. I love everything she does. That's M. Ricky doctor Vase. At XFM co dot uK, you can win all kinds of prizes. Educating Ricky number three. No one. You've had hippopotamuse, you add chicken, you believe it. And the last one is, I'll be new buying one of them. I love that one. All right, interesting one, this. I mean, I spent probably three days looking for this stuff, right? And another one that I came across, right, and I was gonna use. I was just, you know, going on the Internet and that. And I also looking magazines found a story about a bloke who, I don't know, he's messing about with a chainsaw and. I don't know, the chainsaw. He was juggling the midget and whilst taking his alligator for a walk and go on. And his arm come off. Right? Come off. What do you mean his arm come off? The chainsaw took it off? Yes. Okay. Again. There'S a picture of him on an exercise bike, sort of, just with a little stump sort of balancing. But he's getting on with his life, he's happy and everything. Everything's fine. He's not complaining. It's his own fault. He's got no one to blame, right? So anyway, he goes to the doctors and the doctor said, I can do something there. So he goes, well, it's all right, you know, I'm getting by all right. Don't worry about it. And he goes, no, no, we've got an arm in, right? We can. We can attach that. A real arm from someone who's. I think they passed away or lost an arm or something. And they lost an arm and didn't want it back. Yeah. I love it. Are you using that? No, because I know someone. Because I know a bloke, actually. Well, can't just put this one back on. Wow. It's first come, first serve. Really? I was just. Listen, I was just building a bionic man. We've replaced one arm with the robot's arm, so we got spare one. So the doctor's going, let me put it on. He's like, well, all right, then. So. So he does the operation. Everything's fine. He's loving it. He's happy again because he said he can brush his teeth, right? Okay, if this is. If this is gonna be. Because now he can brush his teeth, right? If this is gonna be. And it was a leg or it was a chimps arm or killer. It was. Yeah, it was two left arms, right? I'm going to kill you. Oh, that's. Leave it there. What is it? What's the answer? No, it's not that. I'm just. Okay, right. So. So he says, go on and do it. So he sews it on. And like I said, he's happy. He's brushing his teeth. He can have a pint in the pub. He's lifting a pint with it. All his mates are happy for him. It goes on for about two years. Everything's fine. Then it all starts going flaky. Oh, I knew it would. Was it made of chocolate? All right, so it all goes all like Cammy. And then the arm starts going gammy. Goes gammy. And it gets longer. Of course it does. So there's a picture of him, right, stood in the magazine. He stood there with his arms by his side. One arm's normal, the other one is, like, past his knees. It's really. He can pull his socks up without bending over. So is this gonna be. They gave him. They gave him the arm of an eight year old child who would have been the tallest man in the world. No, he just said, oh, what am I gonna do? And the doctor said, oh, there's not much we can do. And left it. Tell us the explanation. What was it? An incredible plastic arm. An incredible expanding arm. Did he fight crime later? No. Well, that's the end of the story. You've got no scientific explanation as to why. That's why I didn't pick it up. But you just told it to us anyway. Yeah, but I'm just saying the sort of knowledge I come over when I'm looking for. The good knowledge. Yeah. Why did this arm grow? He must have had an adult arm then. Couldn't have given him an arm. I don't know. I don't know. It's just one. It's rubbish. Again, it's an interesting story, but you should have. There was photos. Yeah, but you should have read to. The end of the article, Carl. No, I did and he said it, you know, he's not happy and he wishes he wouldn't have had it done and all that and, you know, did. Sure. This wasn't entirely unexpected? No, seriously. He was saying, you know, his teeth are nice and clean again, because he could brush him and that, but his arms getting in the way, ruining his shirts. So leave that. Let's play tuneless. Come back with the next one. Because I love the fact that this is like Ronnie corn. That wasn't even the story he was going to talk. That's all right, isn't it? Travis level come through quite like that on XFM 104.9. Ricky Steve Merchant and Kyle Pilkington in the chair. We've had the. We've had the answers in. It's rockbusters. It's the results. Carl. Give us the winning answers. Right, Steve, you search for a winner. I will slip into that. So the first one was the fellows only got one badge left. I have no idea. The initial was e. Go on. Will I go out the answer now? Yeah. Give the answer. Yeah, I think you should. That was his last sticker. Yeah. Elastica. The band elastica doesn't work. The word. The word sticker and the. And the badge are not interchangeable. And it's not his last sticker, it's elastica. Yeah, but like, islastica. So someone's got it. Oh, so. So say a different word and it works. Also, if the band is islastica, then it works. God, if only Justin would have named it different. If she'd have just gone, let's call it Islastica, then we'd have. Yeah. Second one. And what was the clue? The unmarried lady is a friendly. Out with. Go on. That's Miss Dynamite. Miss Dynamite doesn't work. Yeah, but it's been running for four weeks. We've done. We've done the obvious. Doesn't work. Doesn't work. Mister Ma again, if she'd have called herself Miss dinner mate, it would work. She didn't. See, what's happening is pop stars are letting you down by naming themselves incorrectly for your clues. Those don't work. They don't count. And the last one, I really, really love that woman. I love everything she does. That was M. Yeah, that was Madonna. Yeah, Madonna. I'm gonna give you that. That work. Yeah. Right. That's the end of that feature until you can get ones that work. Okay? So you won't hear any more that it's rubbish. You're running out already, do you just think of the first three things come in your mind and make them fit? Just think of three bands and make a clue. And if it fits, it fits. If it doesn't, it doesn't matter. I just. I just went through rubbish. It was rubbish. Right, player record. Hang on. We've got a winner. We have, actually. You say all this, Rick, but lots of people got them, right? Yeah. So I don't know what that proves, really. I don't know if that says, you know, you're the tosser or they're as stupid as Carl. One or the other, okay. But I'm gonna give it to Simon and Daisy and hitchin. They got the right answers and well done to them. They get the pelican brief and some other treats. Serves you right. Look, says you're right for understanding. Carl. Swade's new one, obsessions on XFM 104.9. Well, I'm Ricky Jamais, obviously. Steve merchant. Carl. Pilgrims and. Well, Carl, that's about it. And we got sidetracked on the last educating rookie. You telling me about a man whose arm grew? Wow. So something went wrong? I'm not saying it grew, just saying the restroom shrunk. It went along. It went long. What is that growing there? What do you mean, it went long? Did it grow or what? Did it come loose? That's. That's what I was thinking. Oh, so it's hanging by a thread that's made it look long within the skin. It's like how you can stretch a pair of tights if something is too heavy. Arms are very much like tights. They are? Very much. So. The ones. The one that we didn't get round to on educating Ricky was, uh. I'll be no buying one of them. Go on. Are you familiar with the. With the same white elephant? Something is a white elephant. Hold on. You phoned me last night and said, what does white elephant mean? And I told you. Yeah, I know, but I know where it came from. But I just was wondering what it was about. So in what way is educating Ricky? You calling me up and asking me somewhere? Do you know it came about, you've. Given away some of the secrets of the show there, it would appear. I didn't realize he was phoning you for information. We just asked me what the term white elephant went in. Sort of like colloquial. Did he say, why are you interested, Karl? No reason. No, go on. Go on. What it is ages ago. So what do we understand white elephants mean? What? Some of the shoes list. It's like a bit of a, you know. You know, somewhat that you wouldn't want around this. Just stood there doing nothing. Yeah, I'm looking at you, Carl. So years ago, when. When people used to use elephants. Years ago, when people used to use elephants. Yeah. More than they do now. Right. This doesn't involve a midget, is it? So, you know they use them in the workplace and stuff. Yeah. As factories. Yeah, yeah. To move stuff. Tea, ladies? Yeah. Security guards. Yeah. Can't trust them with the buns, though. That's why they stopped using them. Oh, God. Go on. So there was loads of. Loads of elephants knocking about and the. Thing is, right, could move from. If you have a lot of something, you also have a lot of demic ones, don't you? A lot, yeah. Sort of demicky ones. Ones that aren't. Right. Really demicky. Well, you know, like if they weren't. They weren't properly. They weren't. They weren't properly. Right. I'm getting to the story. So what I'm telling, what, they were a bit democracy. So they weren't properly making words up. Yeah. You, Stanley Unwin, reincarnated Demoche. Yeah. There was a lot of albino elephants knocking about. Where? Where is this? Olden times. Africa. Yes. Should we say Africa? Yeah. Yeah. If an answer's got a question mark at the end. I'm not sure it's either Africa or India, but I'll give you a clue. Well, these elephants, do they have big ears or little ears? I didn't sort of notice the size of the elephants. I noticed. What I noticed is they were white because there were albino elephants. Okay. Right. So that's why they're heading. I'll be null buying one of them. Okay. So what would happen is people who didn't know what they were doing, like, you know, you get people making a mistake buying cars that are full of problems and that back then, when people were buying elephants, they'd go up to someone saying after an elephant. And the fellow would say, yeah, I've got one here for you. This is a nice one. And it was all white and stuff and it had like, blue eyes. You should never trust a used elephant salesman. So a fellow who didn't know what he was doing would buy the elephant and he'd get it back and it'd be all sort of lazy and stuff. And he'd say, what's, what's up with this? And his mate, who's a bit of an expert with elephants and go, where have you bought that from? And he said, oh, I got it off that fella. And he goes, oh, all this embellishing nonsense about that. So he goes, why? And he says, it's only albino in it. And he's like, what does that mean? And he said, oh, it's. It gets tired. It's not that good at doing work and that shouldn't steal from you. But elephants back then were like a God, you know, I mean, right? You couldn't, you couldn't say, oh, I'm sick of this. Then I'm going to abandon it or anything. Because elephants were seen as like pretty high up on the chain of things. So they'd end up being stuck with an elephant that's an albino. Couldn't do much, gets tired, basically. Gets in the way. So they said. That's where they're saying, like, you know, but a bit of a white elephant there. What do you reckon, Rick? I feel I don't. I feel like I haven't been educated. I feel like I've lost something, a time in my life I can never get back. I feel like I've sort of been soiled and I. I don't know where to start. I'm angry. Do you know? I mean, I'm angry. Yeah, I can see that. And all that rubbish around. Look at his little face. What was that? All that shit about a second hand elephant salesman and his mate knew about elephants. What is it? What? They had blue eyes. What are you. Well, albeit have red eyes for a start. Oh, that's it. We've run out of time. Oh, what? What? I mean, what are you gonna do about this next week? Are you gonna actually do some educating next week? And what about rockbusters? Are you gonna make the clues? Proper cryptic clues? Well, that's the teaser and that's what we'll leave them with. Will it be any good next week, tune in and find out on XFM 104.9.",
