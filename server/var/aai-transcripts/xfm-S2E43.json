I think they're funny. I think they're straight down the line with a little bit of tongue in cheek. Ah, brilliant. See them on Jules Holland. I didn't sadly know. Brilliant. Really good. Absolutely jumped. Oh. I mean, Jules didn't know what to do. Was he playing spooky woogie? They wouldn't let him play boogie woogie over the song. That's what I mean. That's why he stayed back. But I can't imagine it was very good. They shook. That's what. I thought. I thought, oh, this is missing something. Yeah, this. This is missing someone from squeeze vamping over them. But they did. They did well without him. Extraordinary. Yeah. Well, here we are, then. We're back. XFM one at 4.9. Cards leave early last week. But you can you stay to the end this week, mate, or. Yeah, yeah. You don't need another holiday. Oh. Oh, he started already. I mean, you know, Steve's made you look like a bit of a twat already and it's only 01:05. But the only reason you don't go on holiday is because you have to spend money. Oh, and he's come straight back. I can't come back to that. Oh, it's just dynamite. It's just absolute. That was. That was last holiday, Steve had. He sort of found a third world country so he could live like a king for a week. It was Cuba, wasn't it? Going to Cuba. Amazing. You can. We can almost rule the place. Castro. I'd have been in charge. Cash. I was flashing around to do anything for a dollar over there. It's extraordinary. Literally. I mean, it's amazing. Yeah. Oh, definitely. I went to Kenya before that, so. He thought the prostitute said, no, you were going. Yeah, well, it was $2. I'm not made of money. Do you have a good holiday, Carl? Uh, yeah, it was all right. It's all right. Went down to Cornwall. Now you're going to some odd people down there, Steve. Well, don't look at me. I'm not from Cornwall. Well, you're from that sort of area. Well, not really, but they're genetically means, right? Well, you must have slid right in. Why are they weird? What do they look like? Sort of odd people. A lot of old people. But not just old. Sort of messed up old. What do you mean, messed up old? You can't just say that there's a. Woman with a funny neck. Okay, in what way was it funny? Why did she have a funny neck? If you were writing an essay, you wouldn't say, there was this woman with a funny neck. How would you describe it? She sort of had her head like pointed down all the time. Don't do it, it's his radio. No, but just for you. I don't like that. What about art? Okay, right. So brilliant. I don't know. I was saying to Susan, what happened? You know, what do you think? Because Suzanne knows everything. That's the good thing about her being with you. You just ask her what happened to her. And Suzanne goes, Carl, I don't know, I haven't been here before. Suzanne, your girlfriend or mummy as you call it. Oh, sparks are flying. A little bit of chocolate. Can you just lick a tissue and wipe it off? Oh, she said it might have been like, because back in the olden days they carried stuff on the old days. This one was probably what, 50? No, she looks about 70. Yeah, but like I do on cheeky freak of the week, right. I always turn it around and we get like something good out. Positive. Yeah. I said, I said to Suzanne, bet she finds a lot of money always. Staring at the ground. Yeah. So just add new shoes. And she was admiring them. Yeah. Do you think of that before you point the finger and judge? Our necklace was too heavy. So you're back refreshed. So what we got for this week? Have we? Sort of. Because we didn't meet last night, which we usually meet. I called you and said it'd be good if we could, you know, I wasn't getting back into long past seven, but. Yeah, but we all need to be there. Yeah. So, yeah, no, you're right. I mean, you're absolutely right that I wasn't there yet because I wasn't willing to just be governed by your particular schedule. You want to jet back in from an of your holidays. It wasn't a holiday. Clock wasn't a holiday that you mean. What do you mean it wasn't holiday? What was it? Well, it was a treat, wasn't it, from my mum and dad. So it wasn't a holiday. So you didn't enjoy the five days off? You'd rather have been here moaning 8 hours a day. 7 hours a day. You see, we said last week that you're always whinging here. You are whinging now and you're saying. It'S not even a holiday. You say it's not even a holiday. What was it then, would like a. Nurse who took sick children to Florida, would they say, having a great holiday. Sorry? What particular ailment did your parents have for the week? That. To fly in. Carl Pilkington, Md. Yeah. What are you talking about? Well, all right, it was holiday. Well, then, good. Now, some honesty. There's some truth. So you came in, you came back from holiday, you wanted to start back to work straight away. Steve couldn't be bothered to meet. Is that what you're saying? That's what I'm saying. So we've got nothing prepared for this. Well, you can rely on rockbusters. Right, that's. We've got nothing. Monkey news. Even though you're away, you were still working stuff. Did you go to the monkey sanctuary? I'll tell you. Tell us about it. Play smashing, smashing pumpkins, cherub rock. Yeah. Smashing pumpkins, cherub rock. That, of course, Rick, is available on their greatest hits. Brilliant. If you want. I mean, that's how I rock, so. I know, I know they. I'm very much the shape of a cherub as well. Indeed, indeed. Naked with a. And a rosy, big arc and a trumpet. Yeah. Do they have trumpets? I don't know. I've just got an email here. Monkey news from a listener. Monkey spotted holidaying in Cornwall. A chimp was spotted holidaying in Cornwall last week after befriending a family of three. One onlooker said it was incredible. He dressed and behaved exactly like a human being. He even settled the hotel bill at the end of their stay. The only telltale sign was his lack of table manners and the incoherent babble when he opened his mouth. Well, we did that, Carl. That's the listeners. Carl, that's Joanne. Amusing, articulate, accurate. She remembered exactly who's there and everything sitting in the bill. It's all there. So, I mean, even though people think that you're slightly simian, you know, slightly less than human on the evolutionary ladder, they do listen to you. I don't know who's more stupid in the end, you or the listeners. Well, you may recall, Rick, end of last week, when Colin had to shoot off early, we issued a little request. Yeah. For listeners just to bombard Carl's email with just pointless emails that really weren't about anything, just to clog up his email for when he returned. Yeah, Rick, they sent them all to us. Brilliant. I mean, that's the kind of listeners that we've got. We've got reams here on our email of just junk. I mean, it's like a marks brothers plot, isn't it? I mean, just listen. I listen to what we say. I got one about a shaved cat. Well, that's not pointless. I'll be reading that later. That'll keep me going for a couple of weeks. I'll be reading that. Did you get to the monkey sanctuary because this was the big thing. You were going into Cornwall, you were going to visit the monkey sanctuary. I've never seen someone more excited. You had two days put aside for the monkey sanctuary. How did it go? Monkey world? We were on our way, right. I found like a little. In a little cottage that we had, right? It's like a little folder, you know, with little leaflets. Insane. If you, you know, if you're into mountains, you want to go here. Yeah, if you're into castles and that little monkey on the leaflet, right? So I thought I'll be needing that. Took that out, made sure that's safe and that, right, we get in the car, getting ready to go. My dad says, where is it? A look on the back. It's in a place called low or something like that. Right. So we're on our way. Can't believe me. Look, it's gonna be a great day and all that. And then start looking at the leaflet and noticed didn't have any chimps there. Yeah, it's not, it's not monkey world. It wasn't a monkey world. Well, how was it called then? Something like monkey town? Yeah, it would just add like woolly monkeys in it. That's, that's what. Woolly monkeys. What are woolly monkeys? Those things. Johnny Vegas off the advert. Most of them. They're dumped now since ITV did. You went under. So they just put him in a cage. I don't understand. What if they're dead? Like, um, they're sort of like little fluffy little baboon type things. Woolly monkeys. I mean, not, it's not your chimpanzee. It's not. It's not your classic chimpanzee. So did the car screech to a hole? It was like. Yeah, it was like the mission in armageddon, as you said. Abort. We're on the way back. So how far have you got before you bothered to read the leaflet? Uh, probably about 5 miles away from where we were. So what did you do with yourself? You must have been distraught. We were. They broke down and then they heard banjo music. No, I went to a sort of an amusement place. Right. I'd love to see you in that. What with putting those coins in so it has to roll down and they go flat. And an arm pushes. Really? I spent years on that when I was little. Well, there's a new one. I can't be bothered explaining it, but it's a con. We went to this place, right? My mum and dad had been there before. You said, you'll love it, it's brilliant. It's got like a war bit in it. A war bit, right. Because they know I'm into tanks and stuff, so you'll be loving that. So sorry, I didn't know you were into tanks. No, well, they're all right. He's gone from one of his childhood passions to whether. All right, I know, yeah, go on. But it was. It was. It was awful. I mean, my mum and dad been there before and he said, no, you'll love it, but it was like a really miserable day. Sure. All the rides and that were broke. Yeah, broke. It just reminds me of Manchester. My dad just ended up. He was more interested. There was a really fat family there. Well, presumably he was breaking into the machines, trying to scoop off the cash. I like the fact that those poor fat family were going, why are those people looking at us? Yeah. Oh, do you want to ride one? No, but we're not. We're not a ride. They were massive. And he's just like, look at that. Look at the state. That whole family. Yes. You know, fat bloaters. Yeah. No, because fat. There's no. No need for it, is there? And he was really like, oh, God. And then he wanted to follow them into the outer mirrors to see what they look like. But my mom had got bored. She went off to buy a little snow white figure. She couldn't believe her look. It was only $2.99. Yes. Thought it was going to be really expensive, so she enjoyed that. And then my dad says, come on, we go in, let's rubbish this. But the fat family wouldn't let him play with him. So he just said on the way home, he said, I can safely say that I never want to go there again before I die. So that was that. And then we went home. Why would he ever give you that information? In case it was like a secret birthday present. Oh, God. What if they get me a trip to here? Or if he's in a coma and you go, I'll tell you what, I'd bring him out of it. That fat couple. Yeah, yeah. By his bedside. But Suzanne said she now realizes why I am the way I am after spending like a week with them. Well, they told her that they dropped you on your head as a kid or. No, just like, you know, the way they act and that. Right, yeah. They were saying things like, Suzanne, so why is the moon out at night? In the sun, in the day? Oh, God. Yeah. Oh, God, there's three of them. Suzanne, can you tie my shoelaces again? It was the bit when my dad said, don't waste money on a coffin for him, just put him in a bin bag. Your father said that about himself. That's a great idea. I'm glad you mentioned that, because that is great. That gives me an idea. Coldplay. God, put a smile upon your face on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Karl Pilkington. Reading the paper yesterday, Rick, they were talking about the fact that Blair has been, I think he's been in Greece discussing EU matters. And they used the old trojan horse analogy to say, you know, here's a particular policy, and it seems like they're trying to sneak in, sneak in some kind of dubious. Something else. Exactly. And it's always struck me, ever since I was first introduced to the trojan horse theory, I never understood how it came about. Do you know what I mean? So Karl has got a frown on him, like a thing I haven't seen. Tony Blair is the prime minister. You know what the trojan horse was. Go on. Have you come across. Wasn't that Ascot or anything? Well, the Trojan horse, what happened was, it's a famous kind of greek story about the fact that the Greeks, in. Olden times, olden times, specifically, the Greeks. Laid siege to Troy for six years. Basically, things have got out of hand. I think the Trojans had done something with Helen and someone else was annoyed. Anyway, it all got very complicated. It got out of hand. And the Helen went with the mashed up face because I used to use it to launch ships. Anyway, the Greeks laid siege to Troy for six years, right? And they weren't getting anywhere. They were outside the gates. They were saying, let us in. They weren't. They were. So what they did was they all disappeared. They all wanted to get in and kill everyone. Yeah. That's why they wouldn't be letting in. But they couldn't get inside the city walls. So what they did was they left as a gift for the Trojans. They left an enormous wooden horse, okay, as a gift. And then they all buggered off, like. 40 foot high, 50. I mean, a big, you know, big wooden. An arc. And the Trojans wheeled it into the city. So that's nice thought what a lovely gift. Yeah. And lo and behold, he was hiding inside. But the entire greek army, they let out, killed everyone in their sleep. Yeah. All right. And that's where the famous idea of a trojan horses come from, you know, sneaking something in disguise to something else. All right, okay. So if you ever. Yeah. He doesn't really understand, does he? No, but to be honest, nor do I. Well, this is the problem I've always had with this, because I don't understand who comes up with the idea. I mean, I can't think that was the best idea. Well, no, there must be another ways if they come up with that. How long did it take them to get when they said one before I said, oh, um, can I have a word? Go on, general. Um, I've got an idea. Yeah. Build a big horse, right. Hide inside it, and then, then, ah, I know what you're thinking. They won't let us in, even in the horse. Yeah. Leave it as a gift. Brilliant, right. Who are you? That's the best idea. Are you the guy that came up with, why don't we get a giant bra and twing? Let's get, let's get a hundred foot ruler and, you know, like, at school, used to, like, flick the teacher's ass with, like. Right. I could flick you over one at a time, right, on this giant ruler. That's for your idea. It's on the table. Yeah. We've got a couple of suggestions on the way. What about a million elastic bands tied together? Yeah. And you all hold it down. And then I just let you go, right? And you all ping over and then you kill them in their sleep. You're the best tactician we've got. Are you? What the other thing is, right? These people open the door for some reason. Open the door. Well, I don't understand. Firstly, there's suddenly the. The army that's laid siegel for six years has disappeared in their place. An enormous gift of a giant wooden horse. Oh, they probably don't want to kill us now, but what they've done is they've built us a. Yeah, they. Great gift there is. A giant kind of card or something. You know, something for you, you know, sorry about the land siege and everything. Forgive you. Here's an enormous gift. It's an enormous trojan horse. We know it's what you've always wanted. We're not inside it. Why don't they write that? That's suspicious. Well, wheel it in anyway. But in terms of it as an idea, initially, I mean, we're gonna give them a gift. Well, what should we do? We could bake an enormous quiche, be inside that. We could have an enormous soap on a rope. It's the fact that it's an enormous horse, enormous wooden horse as a gift. Anyway, I don't know if this was a popular gift at the time, but it's also the stupidity of the Trojans saying, brilliant. I've always wanted the enormous wooden horse. Well, what we gonna do with it anyway? Leave it in, let's go to sleep. Let's worry about it tomorrow. Yeah, but it's this idea of going, someone going, is this definitely the best idea? And they go, yeah. And they look to the carpenter and he goes, it's gonna take a while. Yeah, we've got to get wood. Well, you haven't put a door in, how are we gonna get out? Does it look like a horse? It is the worst horse I've ever seen. It looks like a cow. Wow. The adder is where we hide. There's a horse, it's got no tail. Yeah, about, that's the rope that you climb up. But I don't know if it's one of those things where, again, because we kind of learn these things at school, that somewhere along the line the truth of it has disappeared and we are. Well, I imagine it lost a bit in translation. Yeah. Because in eohippus in Greek means giant tank. So that, actually, I was a Sherman. Yeah. And it burst through it. It shot them all. Yeah. But of course, down the years they've tried. Look at Carl's face. Look at Carl's face. If everyone on webcam, Carl, just keep that face and look up to the camera. Right, just, right, get, look at that now. Player record. Carl, educating Carl. We should bring that back. We should bring that back. Yeah. What do you want to learn about next week? We've told you about the trojan horse. Know anything about any freaks? Placebo? This picture on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington. Right, so you've been educated there, haven't you? The trojan horse. And that's, of course, where the phrase be where Greeks bearing gifts come from. Silence again. Yeah, go on, what's that again? Beware Greeks bearing gifts. Right. What do you think that means? Uh, I don't know. I mean, what is that? Is that used worldwide or what? Will they say that in Greece as well? Or. Imagine Christmas day is rubbish. No, it doesn't actually mean we wear Greeks wearing gifts. It's more to do with, like, maybe it's too good to be true or, you know, it's the opposite to don't look gift horse in the mouth. Probably where it came from as well. Justin from south ending Mullin. He just said for the trojans not to have spotted it was a trick. There must have been the biggest bunch of Moronic. Mmm. Yeah. Ever to have walked the earth. Does Karl have any trojan in him by any chance? Cheeky, innit? Hey. What? Never mind. I think that properly proves it. I thought another I like as well. I was saying you might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. I've never heard, I don't think I've heard that. I have heard, but I don't think I've ever used it in common parlance. Well, it's like if you're gonna do something, you know, you might as well go the whole hog, depending on the, the outcome, because it's based on reality. That's why I like it. Because obviously the poor people used to poach, and if they were caught stealing, you know, a sheep running, they would be hung. So if you're gonna get caught, don't steal a lamb, you know, at least feed your family for a few weeks. Right, sure. Kill a sheep. Yeah, yeah. Actually hung. Hush. Your dad would be in trouble down in Wales stealing stuff from that. Oh, from the phone box. Well, he has a couple of sayings, right? Yeah. Yeah. I've never asked him what they mean. Why would you ask Suzanne? One is, don't try and teach your granny to suck eggs. Yeah. Well, that means it's patronizing to, of course, of course. I know that you're talking to someone who knows more about this subject than. You, but how did that happen then? How did that saying come about? Well, it's not, it's, it's a totally made up thing. It's like your granny sucks eggs, and she, because she's, she's older than you and it's probably a lost art or something. All right. Uh, and the other one, um, sucks eggs. Sucks, yeah, sucks eggs. Sorry, I thought you said something else. Don't nudge your granny when she's shaving. What? Sorry? Don't nudge your granny while she's shaving. Don't nudge, sorry, that's lower. I can't, don't know your granny when she's having a shave. Well, what is that in context? Because I can't work out what the analogy is there, because that might just be you. When you were little, you used to run up to your granny while she was shaving or something. Why is your granny shaving? Well, then what, what context is that said in? Tell me the last time your dad ever said that and I'll try and work out what it means. Uh, can't remember. I can't. These aren't specific to your granny. I was to say, were you nudging your granny? She was going, yeah, lost Carl. She was shaving off her moustache or. Giving herself a brazilian. Egg. Suck an egg. Suck an egg. Oh, God. Carl's granny sucking eggs whilst that's. That is brazilian. We've no idea. I don't know what that means. Don't nudge your granny while she's shaving. What? Parmesan? I don't know. Maybe someone knows. You might be right. Maybe. Well, email in. Tell us anyway. Rockbusters, Carl, should we get the ball rolling? Let me just find the gifts here, the little treats. We've got the album from the coral. You know what I think about that? We've got inside feeder. Well, it's just a novelty record, isn't it? Yeah. We've got on DVD more great comedy moments, favorite clips from the best of contemporary BBC comedy. We've got partridge on the front there. We've got one of the guys from Red Dwarf and brilliant stuff on there. Smash hits, the reunion. More great eighties tunes. Catch a goo goo's on there. Plus some stuff. Too shy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me see if you can guess which one's going. Tiffany. Oh, yeah, I know it. The only one. Yeah. I think we're only here. Melan Kim. Respectable. Mm hmm. Human league, that'd be. Oh, wow. What would it do? Would they have got. Don't you want me? Of course, yeah, yeah. Uh huh. Last take on me. Yeah. Well done. Madness. Baggy trousers, of course. Kim world, kids in America. Yeah. So there's just all those traits. If you, if you like a song from an eighties band, it's probably on there. Okay. Plus we've also got on VHS Graham Norton, some kind of best of compilation from his tv show. So there are the. Is it the one way? Talks to sort of female gay icons and look to the Internet because that's my favorite one. Right, there you go. Let's do rockbusters. Email only, of course. Yeah. Email in Ricky Gervais FM dot co dot uk if you know the answer. Right, first one, bit of a cryptic clue if you haven't heard it before. Not cryptic. What is Carl thinking? If you go into France by boat, I'd get your fags on there because it's a lot cheaper. Sorry, we're out of time. Sorry. Your minutes up. You've won nothing. I was reading that question out. I want it to be exactly the same word. Perfect. I bet you it will change all over the place. Buy yourself a birthday. Okay. Okay. Fingers on the buzzers. You've only got 10 seconds to win the gold run. Okay, first up here, I'll tell you what. No, seriously, if you think you're going to France, well, don't, you know, because go on the ferry, get the fags there because it's cheaper. Go on. Alright, so that one again. If you want to buy some fags, you're going over to France on the boat. Get them on there because you'll save a few quid. Bf. Bf. Bf. Okay. Right. The second one. This little foreign cafe is growing its own steak. This little foreign cafe is growing its own steak. Yeah. This little foreign cafe is growing its own steak. Dump. All right. Right. Okay. And the last one. Uh. Is that part of it? Hang on. He's the best, Ellie. He's the best. The jamaican fella might scream this on the. On the Titanic. What jamaican fella might have. Might have screamed this on the Titanic? Yeah. What's it start with? It's C D. That one jamaican fan. Might have screamed this on the Titanic. Ricky Gervaisefm dot co dot Uk. Please don't phone in if you can get those. We just don't want to talk to you. Is that an Ellie? Yeah, it's a summer, too. It's a summer favorite. Nelly, ride with me, that's featuring city Spud. I don't know if you're aware of that, but there we are. Good. Nice summer tune. Carl, tell Steve what you just told me when Steve was in the toilet then. Right. You know, I've just been away with my mum and dad and that, and one of the things I always like doing is having a good chat with my dad about stuff he got up to when he was a kid and that. Yeah, because he got up to loads of stuff. And every time I see him tells me something. Why are you just telling me that now? Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, to me, he's kind of like Ronnie Biggs or someone. He's just the most extraordinary kind of. Well, this character, I can't remember, there was a delay yesterday. There was problems on the Paddington line and he was saying, our trains are what they used to be. Sure. He said, you know, they used to. Be horses, didn't they? Well, he was like. He was looking in the booklet and it was saying how you can have your bags collected if you want. It cost you a fiver. Yeah. So that's outrageous. Sure, course, right. So he said, that's the problem with this country. We've got good with computers and that, but when it comes to, like, getting service, it's gone out the window. Yeah, right. So he said, when I worked on the trains, you know, and he was going on like this, that the other. So I said, oh, I didn't know you worked on the trains. He said, yeah, yeah, when I was 18, right. It was his job to get the coal, right, and chuck it in the engine and, right, and one day he's in. He's in Grand Central station in Manchester, which is now the GMEC center, right? And that was like the main station. And he was in there, the fellow who should have been sort of driving the train, he said, oh, I'm just nipping to the pub. Sure. So you just stay here, keep the engine topped up and stuff. Yeah. So he's like, for a quick getaway. So. So the fellow goes in the pub and my dad's in there, you know, putting the coal on. He did his bacon and eggs on a little shovel. Yeah, yeah. And anyway, fella comes up, he says, right, can you move the train forward now? Oh, blimey. So he was like, oh. So he didn't want to say all the fellas in the pub, because he'd know we'd say, what's he doing in the pub? He should be working. So he said, yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem. I saw it out. All right. So he puts it. Puts it into gear. Whatever you do on them trains starts going forward. Now, people who don't know about trains, something that I learned is, if you're carrying a load of coal or whatever on the back of it, they don't have brakes on each carriage. Right. It's only the engine that has brakes on it. So when you pull the brakes on the engine, the whole weight of what it's pulling is pushing you forward. So he doesn't realize this, though, because he's just used to cooking bacon and eggs and chucking coal. So you've got to slam the brakes on sooner than you would normally. Well, you have to anticipate, I suppose. Yeah, yeah. But he didn't know that. So he's pulling in this thing. Right, I'll put the brakes on now. Yeah. Puts the brakes on. The train just keeps going. It's going. Oh, God, it's not stopping. Sure, it plows right through the signal box. Right. Pulling the signals. I know what they do. Yeah. Loads of. Loads of damage done, apparently. If it was today's money. Yeah. It'd be about three to 4 million pounds with a damage. It shut the station off for four weeks. But he didn't lose his job. The fella lost his job. The one who was in the. In the pub. Yeah. He said. The funny thing was, he said like 4 million pounds worth of damage. He did. His ankle is wrist in. He had three weeks off sick and got paid. So. I love your family. It's extraordinary. The Pilkinson gene. I'd like to see a documentary following you and your family. You'd have to get the family involved now. Sort of stuff my dad goes on about. Never put it on. Sally. Blair. Out of time on XFM 104.9. We ought to give those rock busters clues again. Very few contributions so far. I think you've really. This might be it. I've told you, you're on thin ice. If this. If this goes wrong, if it's rubbish, and if everyone doesn't get them all, that's the end of rockbusters. Right, well, the first one again, right, yeah. If you go out of France, right, by boat, you might as well get your fags while you're on that because you'll save a few quid. Right. Bf. BF is the initials of the artist. That little cryptic clue makes up the second one. Little foreign coffee growing its own steak. Right, that's d. Little foreign coffee, it's growing its own steak. D. And the last one, if there was a jamaican fella on the Titanic when it went down, it probably scream this circle. D. Right, so email in Ricky dot gervasexfm dot co dot UK. Yeah, they're not flooding in, but, yeah. I'll see how we do. Carl, we still got monkeys. We've got monkey news coming up. Now, you must be disappointed because you didn't make it to the monkey sanctuary, but you've still managed to scrape together monkey news on your holiday. Yeah, that's how I found some of that. We've got. How do you get so many breaks and holidays? Because you went. You went away with Suzanne's parents. You've just been away with your parents. That's a couple of weeks. Ten days. That's probably about three weeks in all. You had that. You went to Manchester, you were. You had that day off because your trousers were wet. I mean, and you've, you know. I mean, I suppose because you've only got one job and, you know, I've got a lot more. This is just one of my jobs. But, I mean, don't you ever count your blessings? Go. God. Thank God. I just. I can have time off. I don't work too hard, you know, I'm not stressed too much. It's just all to do with when you do work. Do a lot. So I get a lot done. Yeah. What do you mean? I'm always doing stuff. I mean, even though when I was in Cornwall, right, I'm sat there on the grass. Oh, I'd love to just sit on the grass. I know, yeah. Well, you know me dad and Susanna playing crib. Right. I sort of fallen out with him. Because you do live in the 1940s. Yeah. Why'd you fallen out? Because we. Crib. Have you ever played crib? Yeah. Right. You've got to be pretty good at maths. Sure. You've got to make your cards add up to 15. Well, yeah, I'm just gonna. I was just gonna correct you on. You've got to be good at maths. Yeah. What, algebra, quantum physics, what? No, just. Just adding. Adding up to 15. Brilliant. You almost do it on your fingers. You could in Cornwall. But my dad's really good at maths and like he said, how many have you got? And he always counts, isn't. It's like 15, 215, 415. Six, three for your ones and all that. He adds it up, really. One for his knob. Right. So I was like, right, hang on a minute. And he goes, no, what do you mean, hang on? I thought, what have you got? Forget it. I said, this isn't. This isn't fun. If you're going to start getting all. Arty with me, I love it. But he's only. I'm sure he's. I don't know him, but I'm sure he's just winding you up. His victory is you going, ah, forget it, I'm not playing well anyway, right. So it doesn't matter. I think I'll go off and do some prep. Right. Do some research for Saturday. Found one of Susan's magazines. Right. Flicking through because there's always interesting stuff in there. There was something about. About swingers, right. I was like, what's all that about? Yeah. And I had an interview with some people, talking about, you know, how they sleep about a bit. Yeah. And I thought, if my wife looked like that, I probably would, because there was a few pictures of them and they were all pretty ugly. Yes. Right. So I took that in. So there you go. Carried on reading. There was a bit in there about our women still have crushes, right? Yes. And the woman was going on about how she's 38, right? But she still fancies Chris Martin from Coldplay. And, you know, even though it'll never happen, she's still got that little bit in her head that thinks one day she'll leave Gwyneth, right. And end up with her. Right? Right. Anyway, so I'm flicking, I'm thinking, this is a bit boring, but I'm flicking through it all and. Is this a Rockbusters clue? No. No. Right. And I read. I read further on. Read further on, right. And she said, you know, I like to go out with my mates and we come up with lists in pubs of people who like, oh, you know, they. They'd be nice to go out with. She also came up with a list of unlikely lost objects, I think she called them. Yeah. Guess who was in that list? Ricky Gervais. Think again. Carl Pilkington. Right, next one. Johnny Vegas said, lanky co writer. Rubbish. Lanky co writer. What do you mean, lanky co writer? Well, do I need to say anymore? Hang on. Wait a minute. Let's not talk about. I don't want you laughing at my expense. I'm an unlikely lust object. Yeah, but you. Yeah. What was it called? The list? The. The unlikely lust object? Yes. You were in there, right? Who else was? Well, you weren't in there. Richard. Richard Madeley. Fine. Yeah, it's a good looking guy. Alistair Campbell. Brilliant. Another handsome dude. What you talking about? How can you. How are you? What, you think I'm ashamed or embarrassed about that? I'm proud of it. What magazine was it? I need to buy a couple of coins. Need to get a t shirt made. Yeah. And did she leave her number? Yeah. What. What magazine was it? Just. I'm just out of interest. I think it's called red. Yeah, sure. But now you've dissed those people that have put themselves in their swingers because you've said they're ugly. So now we know what magazine it is. People look at that. People look at that poor woman and they're gonna know you think she's a hog. No, but I think they. Even though. Was there a picture of a woman who drawn up the list of unlikely lust objects? Mm hmm. What was she like? I wouldn't waste my time. Thanks, mate. I know you're on my side. The thrills on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant, object of unlikely last object. Steve Merchant. I'd like to have that now prefixing my name everywhere I'm written about. I know, yeah. Did he make the freak list? Which is a different magazine, isn't it? And I'm joking, of course. Carl Pilkington, a man of sort of quiet, quite dignity, and. And in a way, he's got his own sort of inner beauty, hasn't he, Kyle? Not really. Do you think? Well, I'll tell you why I don't think it is. Because the woman that wrote the piece saying that I was an unlikely lust object has just emailed in. And, Carl, you've offended her quite considerably. What did he say? I wouldn't waste my time, is what you said. She's repeated. I wouldn't waste my time. The flaming cheek. Although it's a horrible picture. I am, of course, in real life, a vision of loveliness. I'm not 30, I'm 25. I don't think Stephen's that unlikely lust object. A sense of humor is important. And he's welcome to my phone number if he wants it. The sense of humor is important. That's a swinger. Stop it. Don't have a go at the woman I'm messing about. She knows I'm messing about. Well, how are you messing about? I've told you this, though. I've told you that anyone could be listening, haven't I? I've told you that before. Things you say and. And you. But we encourage him. We say, what does she look like? We did, but it's meant to be rhetorical. That was a joke. That was Stephen joke. What does he look like? That is him joking. Like, oh, I'll call her up because I'm on a list. And then you have to say that. I mean, that's what I mean. Just chances are if, you know, if she likes Stephen, she hasn't seen him. She listens to the radio, so the likelihood is that, you know, she was listening to this show. Yeah. So think. Will I drop the thing I was gonna do about Lisa Riley? Well, she's not listening. Some people do it. She's still at lunch. What? From Tuesday? There's an all you can eat place going out of business. You kill me, I got a new bambino. Please leave now. Please leave. So, uh. No, but she knows was only messing, this. Yeah, everyone knows you're only messing. We're all only messing. I hope we don't offend anyone of, you know, any kind out there. We're only joking, aren't we, Kyle? Say something nice about her. What can you remember of the picture that you could do, you could say was good. Maybe she was wearing some, to be honest. I'll have another look and have a look. I think she had a nice shirt, honestly. Forthcoming single from british sea power, that's called carry on, I love it. Great, it's fantastic on XFM 104.9. What do you make, Carl, of these people? I was reading a paper today, they've been queuing up for 12 hours last night for the new Harry Potter book. Oh, God, it really annoys me, everything. Oh, God, it really annoys me. But who has to. I mean, I know it's just a kind of willful sort of stubbornness. I see adults, yeah, reading it, you know. Well, I was up in Hampstead last night, and there's a Waterstones branch of that, and there were a couple of people outside queuing, waiting for it to open. What they look like? Well, things that. Like the ones that come out of a forbidden planet on a. There was one guy, I mean, I don't mean to disrespect him, but he was a big bloater, shorts, wearing shorts. I don't want to see his big fleshy legs. He looked like John O'Colman, if I'm not. Was anyone with John O'Callaghan? They seem to have knapsacks for some reason. Well, they got old, they got old papers in there. Nine years supplier, four of them, there. Was a couple of women, a couple of guys, all look basically the same, they were interchangeable and they were there. From them in a minute. Yeah, I am the fat bloater with. Fleshy legs, I recognize your description, I. Like to read these books whilst listening to XFM of a Saturday. And I was watching them from where I was, and they were. Must be there for about an hour and a half. They were obviously strangers, their common interest was Harry Potter. They were reading, they were chatting to each other for about an hour and a half, so as I'm leaving, I wander past them an hour and a half in to them having met each other, the conversation is. All I heard was, well, of course, apparently she cried when she finished the last one, and I thought, they've not moved on, the conversation had not moved on. Yeah, they might have been talking about Dawn French, you know, her chocolate orange by then. Yeah, I know she cried when she finished the last one once. Yeah, but I got no time for him. No. Am I pop into walrus now? Yeah, I'll tell you what, you get over half one and start reading it. Exactly. Brilliant. So you can put it on the Internet. Oh, your opinions? Oh, it annoys me. It is extraordinary. The whole kind of. The whole kind of Harry Potter phenomenon is passed me by. I know, I know. Good luck to her, you know, but. You meet adults, who are you say, what you doing is. I'm just rereading Harry Potter. What, you couldn't follow it the first time? Yeah, I mean. I mean, it's not her fault, you know, she made 300 million pounds by writing a few books. Well done. But I'm sure they. I mean, I'm not sure they're very good, but I haven't read them. I'm sure they're not. But no, I don't know. No, no, no, I'm joking. And make millions. If you think it's so easy, you do it. You. You like him because you look a bit like him. Wow. You know, I wonder if he's on a. That wish list. That what? That woman who emailed in. Why was she making a list of unlikely. Can we leave this now? No, but I mean, what was it? What was context? Was it. It was like, here's my top ten weird looking fellas that I do. What was it? No, no, but what, what was the. What was she was talking about? What she'd started talking about? What, body wax. And went, and by the way, while I'm here, it's ten blokes that I would if I had to, and they're a bit weird. You'll be surprised. What was the context forgot? He's scared to say anything now. He's scared to say anything. Oh, blessing. I just was looking at a picture because I was attracted to it because she was good looking and that didn't read on. That's got you out of that little mess. Harry Potter. Yeah. Have you read them? No, because the first time it came out, I was a bit confused, wanna. Because I thought it was. Of course you were. Yeah, because. What? This is a what? It's a book. No, I got confused with the little. The little rabbit. I thought it was her dinner. You talked about it. Beatrix Potter. Yeah, I got. I got mixed up with that, so I sort of missed out on the first one. Anyway, sort of too late to get into it, I think, after. Yeah, it's too late now. Yeah. It's impossible. Same with Shakespeare. If you weren't around, you know, the day. The day you wrote the first ones, there's no point in going back. But it's all the fuss that she's getting as well. Like, well, I think it's because she's. A british industry now, isn't she? I mean, it must have made, what, billions? Well, it's the perfect success story. She writes a story for her children and it becomes a worldwide phenomenon. You know, it's not cynical, it's just. It's just a great. Did your dad ever pop anything down in writing? I'll tell you what, my mum wanted to do it. Yeah. There's been loads of things. Little inventions she's come up with and that, which has been too busy doing other stuff. But she used to come up with stories for me as a kid that I'm sure if they came out, they'd be a success. Yeah, go on. Do you remember any of them? There was one about a little red car. I can't remember how that ended, but the one that was really good was about a kid who gets a dog. Right, but it's quite an old dog. This is gonna be an episode of the Walt Ones, isn't it? Go on, go on. And he's playing with the dog and that, but it starts getting a bit old, about 15 or whatever. Yeah. And he goes, oh, it's rubbish, this dog. I would love that book for kids. I would love that. Tommy went, oh, mummy, my dad. Kill it, then? Yeah, just throw it in the lake. I'll get you another one. Do you want a Nintendo? Yeah. Kick the rabbit to death, then, or no food for you. Brilliant. Jump van Halen on XFM 104.9. Right, come on in, Carl. We got a lot to fit in now. We've insulted a lot of people. Only about 25 minutes to go. We've got monkey news, we've got rockbusters, we got a cheeky figure the week. This week could crumb it in. See how we do. We want. Do we want to hear the end of Carl's story? Yeah. Little Timmy and his 15 year old dog lucky, got a bit bored with it, right? So he said, oh, you know, this dog's rubbish and that. I'm sick of it. Yeah. So she goes, how old were you when your mom was telling you this story? About four. Okay. It wasn't last week on holiday, so. So she goes, all right, then, we'll get you another one. Yeah. She goes, brilliant. What do you do with the old one? Just kept it, but didn't sort of play with it. Just ostracized it. Yeah, go on. Yeah. What did you get in? What sort of dog? I think it was a little, little baby like Labrador puppy, not poppy. Yeah, yeah. Good. Well, good choice. Good choice for a second dog. So, yeah, I'm loving this story. I'm actually living the story. So where's he live? I don't know. It didn't matter. Didn't matter. Near a lake. That will make sense in a minute, right? So. So he's got a little dog. He's playing around with it. He's playing with its belly and stuff. He's thinking, this is brilliant. Best dog I've ever had, right? And the other dog sat in the corner looking all fed up. Yeah. So I like this story. So he says, he says to his mom, right, I'm taking little puppy down the park. Yeah. And she goes, well, take the old one with you. And he goes, oh, do we have to? It's the moment. I bet the old one saves him. So. So, because I do have to. She goes, yeah, it still needs a walk. And that. It's crapping all over the house. So takes it down the park, right? And it's playing around. And he's playing near that. Near the lake. Is the puppy near the lake, Kyle? Because this is what's worrying me. Yeah. Pop is near the lake, right? That jumps in. The kid goes, oh, God. He jumps in, remembers he can't swim. Yeah. This kid is based on you in. It, almost certainly flapping about. Water's going everywhere. He's gonna come. Oh God. And, like, he wants the puppy to help him, but the puppy's just like drowning as well. Yeah. The old dog comes up, drags them both out. He goes, I can't believe it. You know, I said I was fed up with you. Yeah, you saved me life. Yeah. He gets home and he says to his mom, kill the little one. Kill the puppy. Yeah. So it's good little. What does he say when he gets home? He said, I don't need the puppy now. Brilliant, brilliant. Genius. Good night. Yeah. So the moral of that story? Well, they follow your whims. They just say, yeah, if you get bored, get bored. If you get bored with the old one again, to do it again, I mean, just eventually, you know, get something. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's brilliant. That is a brilliant story, though. Right? So that's that. Rock busters. Yes. I don't want you to have monkey news right now. Just add a little story there. Sure. Yeah. Don't go too far. Yeah, go on. We'll get rockbusters out of the way if we got a winner. Yeah. It worries me that there's. We've had a very few entries. I think that even your mental fans aren't getting these, which is really worrying. They must be terrible clues this week. All right, well, has anyone gotten. Right, Steve? I think there's just one guy. Yeah. Who I suspect has won in the past. Well, so what? Right, the first one. If you go out of France by boat, you might as well buy fags when you're on that because you'll get them a lot cheaper. Brilliant. Right, yeah. Bf. Yeah. Buy it. Ferry. Right outside. What? Buy on ferry. What? I'm. What's that? Is that a band? What? What is it? I don't know. Brian Ferry. Brian Ferry. What's that got to do with buying on a ferry, though? Just because he's quite close to it. Diane. Buy on ferry. What? Buy them. Buy on ferry. So what's your first language? The second one. That's rubbish. That doesn't count. Brian. Byron Ferry. Brian Ferry. Buy on ferry. There's this little foreign cafe, it's growing its own steak. That's Delametri, the third one. What? Tell me, what. What is that? What is that? Delameitri. Deli is a little foreign coffee. Yeah. A meat tree in that. A meat tree? A meat tree. What were the initials for that? Just. Just d for that. Just d for that. Yeah. So not da. So you didn't even give him a chance to get the group. They got it. Well, they didn't write. It's the end. Go on. Right. Go on. Deli. Meat tree. Deli. Meat tree. One word. D or any letter m's in it. Go on. Okay, so, Byron. Byron. I love Bayern Ferry. And music. Oxy music was brilliant. I love oxy music. Go on. Can I just point, Rick? David bowie. Deli meat tree. Yeah. I don't see why necessarily. Aidan, who emailed in, why he doesn't get to win because he emailed in dire steaks, seems to me just as valid, as far as I can tell. But deli metri it is. And the last one. If there was a jamaican fella on the Titanic, I'm looking forward to this. With a little bit of fear. Jamaican fella. If he was on the Titanic, he probably would have screamed this. Yeah. That's Christ Deburg. Stunning. So who's the winner? I'm not gonna give it to anyone. I just don't. What's the jamaican bit got to do with it? It's the D. Just Christy Burgundy. Say it again. No, I think they've worked out now. What's again? Christ de Burg. And who's that? What? Who's that? Who's what? Who's Christ de Burg? Christaberg. Who's the winner. Steve. I. Do you know what, I'm gonna give it to a. Because he just, he just treated you with nothing but contempt. Steve Martin emailed in again. He got the first two and then the last one. He just emailed. I neither know nor care about this answer I'm tempted to give him. Do you know what you've done there, don't you? You've put the nag in the coffin of rock musters. I warned you. I warned you for three weeks and you sort of bucked your ideas up for a little while but Christ did. Those are the worst you've ever done. The worst delimitri. So. And didn't just put D and then Bayern ferry buy and fairy, but. So no, we're doing it. Play record. Aren't we doing it? I'm a shame. You're an idiot. Are we doing anymore? I'm just gonna keep saying you're an idiot player. You learned nothing from Doctor Fox. Yeah, that's not a Sony out the window. What? You need to start working on it now because they're so good. You need to start working now for next Saturday. Aren't we doing it anymore? Just, I don't know, cardigans? You're the storm on XFM 104.9. Well, nearly the end of the show. But we wouldn't, you know, we wouldn't let them down, would we? You know what it is now, don't you? Oh, chimpanzee that monkey news right? Now. Whilst I was in Cornwall, I wasn't online, I didn't have the Internet. So it's like, oh, what am I gonna do? And I didn't come back till yesterday. I thought, is there loads going on that I don't know about in the monkey world and stuff? I was hoping to get some from the zoo that was meant to be going to. Course that didn't happen. So I said to my dad, do you know anything about monkeys? Have you got any stories? Brilliant. This is. No, this is what Trevor McDonald does. Turned out quarter ten, he goes, nothing, dad, ending up. And you got anything? Politics? Anything politics, dad, this isn't monkey news. I'm just giving you this. Free. Yeah, brilliant. Turned out one of his mates used to have a chimp. What do you mean one of his mates used to have a chimp? Well, two of his mates. Oh, sorry, yeah, I was thinking, it sounds a bit far fetched living in Manchester like. But if there was two of them. He had a chimp. Had to thump it in the head. For doing what? Answering back. Oh, God. Tried it on with his wife. Trying it on with his wife. I love it, I love it. It's a proper fist fight in a pub in Manchester. Oh, I'd call him up, but he's one of them. He like swears all the time. I mean, it'd be good. It'd be good to get him on. And let's interview him. Can we not interview him pre record? We can bleep out this way and I'd love to hear his story. Yeah, well, we're not scared of work. Don't tell us the rest of the story then. Let's let him say no. There's another one as well. When you say you can get him on, but he swears a lot. You mean the monkey? I'm assuming he's more coherent than your dad's mate is. Him. And there's some other fellow we know who had a funny name. I'll have to find out. Because you love his name. But he was a drag artist. Yeah. And I think he said he went, my dad went round one day, I don't know why, right. Went around there, knocked on the door, chimp answered. Carl, I don't know what you're doing, mate. I don't know where this place you live next door, there's an horse in the front room, there's chimps running around. Anyway, chimpanzee, is that the end of the story? There's a chimpanzee in the door and that's the end. You sure it wasn't the drag ice before he'd shaved? No, sure it wasn't your grand because. I like the really airy ones that decide they can be female impersonators. Yeah. Anyway, this is the monkey news, so you got that for free. What's this gonna be like? More jingles? Okay. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey news extra. Okay, right, another phrase. We've been talking about phrases today. Yeah, we have. When she's shaving. Yeah. Don't teach your grand to suck eggs. Yeah, don't look horse in the mouth. Don't let the chin pass the jaw if you're chucking your cock in. Familiar with the phrase monkey business? No, never heard that one before. Carl, that's brilliant. Right, well, it came about, this has been emailed in and I haven't really had a chance to look at it so I'm just weighing it up now. This is the biggest shambles on air, isn't it, really? I'm ashamed of it. I mean, what was Doctor Fox? Doctor Fox must have been really polite. He must been thinking, I don't know how to put this. He must have wanted to scream and go, you shouldn't be in the radio authority. My parents listen online. I can't look them in the eye. I think I've weighed it up. Long time ago, right. In the olden days. Yeah. In the Amazon jungle. Yeah. Right. Little family of monkeys in there, right. Having a good life. Didn't have any predators in there. Right. So they were loving it. Yeah. They had a load of food around them. They had loads of banana trees. Right. No, I don't think so. No, they did. Sorry, everything's going great. So they're happy in that. They go out of bed, okay. Wake up in the morning, load of bananas gone. Oh, hang on. Interesting. Hold on. Wait a minute. So has either your dad's been around. Or this isn't the great Amazon banana robbery, is it? So anyway, turns out it was another load of monkeys from another part of the island. From the rough bit. From the rough bit? From the rough bit. I love it. They went into a middle class area. They're the ones with the earrings and the leather jacket. That is brilliant. So the monkeys thought, well, there's no point getting into a fight with them because they're harder than we are. Yeah, of course. And they carry chains and tattoos. Yeah, go on. So basically they said, let's do some business with the bananas. Let's do some business. What are you talking about? Right, calm, though. We haven't got much time left. Oh God. What do you mean? Liz, forget it. No, don't forget it, Carl, do not seriously. Switch the record off. Switch the record. Switch the record off. Karl, what are you talking about? What did they do? Oh, let's do business with the bananas. Yeah. So they said, well, rather than them coming robbing them, we'll flog them. So that stopped to it. Then the people, the monkeys came, didn't have money. They said, give us someone, you know, give us some bananas. And it says, so what? They exchange bananas for bananas for berries and nuts. So that's where the phrase monkey business no come from. Little business to settle. That's the end of that as well. So that's the end. That is a shame. That's the end of Rockbusters and monkey news. Well done. You've done it in one show.",
