Ricky Gervais, XFM 104.9, Saturday afternoon. If you didn't know that, I don't know why I mentioned it. That was stupid, really. You must know that by now. We've got some great things coming up. We haven't. We got songs and chat and things. We'll also, of course, be running through the white van man questions from the sun again, but this time Carl will be answering them. I look forward to that. Yeah. Can we do that fairly soon? Oh, there's some good questions this week. Yeah, we will. But as I was coming in, there was like a bunch of posh lads, I think, university students trying to get in because they're doing one of those scavenger hunts that they have to get points for charity and do stuff, and one of theirs is get on a live radio show. So I sort of, sort of felt sorry for them. So I said, they come on here just for five minutes. Who are they? And they're just. Are they toffs? They are sort of like toss, but they're trendy toffs. That's obviously trendy toss. I don't know. Is that like Lady Victoria Hervig? No, I don't mean that. No, they're both sort of like that will off Popeye. Right, right. Sort of like trendy, but posh. They seem nice enough and they're doing it. That is for counter cherry. And they just get, they've got, they. Got their sponsor to do very. I don't know quite how it works, but they're gonna, they're gonna come on and because we get that for coming on this live radio show, they get 17,000 points. Right, good. If I can put that in context. Yeah. If they were to say, did it help deliver a baby, they only get 7250 points, but it's much easier. It is. There's lot, there's lots of women happily dropping sprouts all over the place. You can't get on a live radio show these days for love. No money. That's true. I mean. Yeah. So when are they coming in? Our car said they're going to 130. I had a word with them. Okay. What do you make of them? They are posh, really. But they said they're gonna wander about and go and see if they can deliver a baby in that and then come back here for 130. And I don't know if you can. I hope they don't like it. Leave a baby sort of half out, you know, if they've got. They've got it. You know, they push, push, push. Sorry, we have to shoot off. We got. We gotta play an instrument in a marching band for 8500 points. Well, I did say be definitely at 130 because I don't want you getting in the way of the white van questions. The other thing is, right, they get 7500 points for delivering a baby but they get 9000 points if they cut Peter string fellows hair. Well, he's, you know, he's very precious about his hair. It's a more delicate operation, isn't it? There's more that can go wrong. That's true enough. Take an unconventional animal for a walk in a park. What is it? That could be a dog that just doesn't play by the rules. Yeah, that's a dog that's into slipknot. Yeah. Wheeze in the urinal. Yeah. Standing up. Exactly. Yeah. Well, I'm looking forward to lovely, guys. Good luck to. Yeah, we'll see you later. Nirvana, Manus, older world. Carl's all confused. It didn't tell you it was ended, did it? What is that, then? Is that a sort of glitch on the computer? Just applause, isn't it? They might start swearing. You know what they're like. Rock stars. Yeah. Blue language. Yeah. And all their habits. Yeah. That says track ending. Now, stop talking about. It's Dustin. That's that. You're giving away all the secrets of radio and that. People think it's like an old piece of vinyl that we've put on a needle. You know, like those old bits of footage of Tony Blackburn. That's what they think. It's like. They don't realize there's computers doing it all. Yes. You're showing them behind the curtain. Never do that. I won't do that. Um, in the week, I called Carl up and said, how are you, mate? You mean not too bad. Now, as you know, his girlfriend's been away for ages, hasn't she? Covering the World cup, the african american nations. Nations cup. She's a sports journalist. I love about you thinking. What does that mean, like? Well, she's not much of a journalist, Rick. I've read some of her stuff. No, but she's not on air. She does stuff, you know. Yeah. Behind the scenes. Yeah, sure. A lot of journalists do. You're not going out with k 80. That's what you want to make clear in it. Yeah. Now, so she. She'd seen none of the meteoric rise of Carl. She's been away for the whole time. A wit. Yeah, a cult figure, to be honest. And he hadn't. He hadn't told her this, so apparently he went home when she was sitting there looking a bit grumpy, went away. So, yeah, she went, should we go out? Then? He went. She went, I'm not sure I want to go out with an idiot. Oh, no. Yeah, because Loch Ness monster. Won't you just think? Of course the Loch Ness monster lives in Loch Ness and she was given a bit of a hard time. That's why he said. That's why I. I didn't tell her, you know, I didn't tell her, really. Same thing happened when I was at school and I had to play drums in little donkey. I didn't tell my parents, right. But my dad turned up anyway. And what happened? How old were you, Karl? Well, it was, it was the school that I used to go to. Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You used to go to the school you used to go to? No, but what I mean is, I didn't go to secondary, did I? So I missed a lot of that. Sure. But primary I liked. Oh, it was all colouring in and stuff. Yep. And it was a Christmas play and I managed to get a part in it. Did you audition? Got a part in it. And I should have been playing the drums to the one about kings. We three kings. Yeah. I was meant to be doing that, but little Donkey came on and it was one of their. What do you mean came on? That was like, next up on, you know, the next song. Right, right. And it's one of them songs that you can't help sort of tap it along to. Yeah. Do you know, like, um. Like if I. If I was to go. Yeah, you'd have to finish it with. Yeah. Do you know that they actually send that into space? Do they? And what? Hoping the aliens will respond with that? Yeah, they do do that because apparently it's. It. It is one of them things that. You can't help even if you're an alien life form. Yeah, they know that, do they? Anyway, what can they watch? Star Trek or slow knock knock. Knock knock into space? Yeah. They have to say. Oh, that is. That is great. Hold on. What's something out there? Was it a little green fellow? That is great. So anyway, that is. Little donkey is like one of them tunes that you. And I was there and I had the drumstick and I thought, oh, God, the drumstick. I could feel myself just wanting to do it. Yeah, I started going along and playing little donkey, which I wasn't meant to do, but it went down such a storm. What were there people, like, parents and that, dozing off. And then suddenly they heard your version of little donkey. They thought, wait a minute, now it's really picking up. I'm glad we paid a pound 50 for this. What do you mean it went down? Such a storm. They're going, hold on, was it like. People have micros in the air? Ringo joined the Beatles now, going, boo. Pete best. But he went, whoa. Oh, God. But the teacher just said, oh, it went down really well. You can do that again tonight, right, when you're in it again. But anyway, so my dad was there. And you hadn't told him about this performance, so he just turned up his own back. I never took the lighters home and stuff. Show me, mum, dad, because it just put me off. So anyway, he turned up. Don't know why. You must have heard from someone else's dad. Yeah, he turned up and he swore about me, which did he? I don't. Can you. Could you. Could you use a word to be said? The word course is right. If you. If you got a kid in the car or anything, you can turn it down now. Right. But he said there was a guy stood next to him with a camera, big video camera, filming it, and he said, yeah, film it, but try and avoid getting the twat in the hat in the shot, because I had one of those porters, you know, the little round pork pie, hats on. Right. This is so sad. What was this, a nativity play? It was about Jesus and stuff. Yeah. Well, there was a porter there helping him with his bags. It was. I forgot. I mean, Mary and Joseph, they got there. Yeah. Because it was the hope, you know, that the inn was full. But I think the porter doubled up with the inn and the stable. Right, that was. Yeah. He carry bags over. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, yeah, you're right, though. I don't know why I was wearing one of them, but I was. And your father said that. And how did you know your father said that? Did you hear it later? I told you about it later. Yeah. I was talking about stuff I'd done at school and he said, oh, God, remember that now? And he. I spoke to him the other day about it. Right. And. So that was. That was the end of your sort of drumming career, really, because it could have been. I mean, you know, the audience loved it the night before. You could have like, been like, who knows? A whole new world for you. Yeah. I never drummed. I've never drummed. I wish I had. That is that. Is that. And that's why you don't. And you don't tell you still, your mum and dad don't know you on. The radio, do they? I think when they were down the other weekend, they had to come in. I just said, oh, just go in and press buttons because they could listen. On sky digital, couldn't they? They could do, but you wouldn't want that. I don't want that. No play record. I'll talk to you again a little bit about this later, yeah. Princess superstar, bad babysitter, first played on this show by Steve Merchant. By bad Steve Merchant. That's true. By Steve Scratch Merchant. I mean, I still like that, but the videos put me off it a little bit because it's just. It makes it into the novelty record. It always had the potential of being. I agree. Although I was never a big fan of babysitter. Bad babysitter was not my favorite from the album. Sure. If people want my interest in my views on hip hop, then they can always email in, Rick, or call you at home. Just give me your ring at home. No problem. Yeah. Or I just pop out and you hang with them. Yeah, sure, sure. Now it's time for White Van Man. White van man, yes. Those that don't buy the sun, they think it's beneath them. White Van man is a column they have, I think, every day, actually. And they just get sort of some, you know, Joe public to kind of comment weeks news. Just seemed to me, you know, that it might be interesting to get Carl's views. Yeah. On some of the biggest. Not because we think that Carl hasn't got a valid sort of viewpoint. No, because Carl sees the world differently. To some people, that's always. That's what's interesting, you know, like an artist does or. Exactly. He's very bohemian in his outlook. Do you. Do you feel that you're up to scratch on this week's news? I don't like. Then don't you? Don't. Just relax. Why not? It's pressure. No, no, no, because you just have to give us your first opinion. Honest answer. That's all we've ever asked of you, Carl, and it's all you ever given us. You're honest. You're first. From the heart of you. Yeah, don't worry. Just relax. Are you worried that people are listening and thinking, you're an idiot if my. Girlfriend'S listening now, go and have a wash or something. Go and have a wash. Not very nice, is it? Is it the opposite of Napoleon and Josephine? Yeah, go on. Go on. If you're gonna visit me again. Josephine, for sake. What? I'll ease you in with something fairly easy. A music based question. Kylie Minerve versus Dido as queen of the Brits. What's your view? Then. Go and have a watch. It doesn't really matter, does it? What does it mean with the Brits? I was watching it the other night and I think Kylie will be a good looking old woman. I want to. Steve, I want to celebrate with you every time we open his mouth. Doesn't matter. I want us to open a bottle of champagne. I know what you mean. Do you know? I mean, it's like we did that. Yes. Look at people. And another person who springs to mind, Jenny Powell. I don't think she's that good looking now. Who's Jenny Powell? Is she that girl that used to be the assistant on wheel of fortune? Yeah. Yeah. I think she's a bit over the top for a young woman, but when she gets older, I think she'll look. Be a bit of a stunner. So, for you, Kylie, whereas you don't feel that about Dido. Is that right? She's all right. She's normal. I prefer Kylie's sister to Kylie. You know, she. I can imagine her being at hard work to live with and who, Kylie not doing, washing up and that. Right, sure. Okay. And what do you make of taxes rising in the next budget to pay for NHS improvements? Well, my dad went to hospital to have an operation once. Yeah. So I feel like it's worth paying it. Because people. Because people might go after good hospital. Yeah. Yeah. It makes a change when it's someone in your family, doesn't it? Yeah, because you sort of realize. Yeah. Changes as good as the rest. And the weird thing is, if you want, for me dad, I won't be here doing this show. Because when he was in hospital. Well, no, I'll stop you there. Yeah. To be honest, you wouldn't be here. True, but. No, but no, no, because this was after a was born, so I would be here. But his more direct involvement was what? Yeah, because when. When Imam was seeing me dad in the hospital, I got a bit bored, went for a wander, found the hospital radio station. Yeah. And got a gig. Really? So in a really real sense, if it wasn't for Carl's dad, Karl wouldn't be here. And did your dad, like, while he was listening to you, did he, like, sort of tap the nurse and go can you get that twat off the edge? Who's put him in that? Okay, um, what do you make of the real life Mowgli, who's surviving in a transylvanian countryside? Apparently. I don't know much about this story. I don't know. You know, Mowgli, he's the guy's the one. Good book. Yeah. Kid that grew up with bears and animals and stuff. Apparently, there's a real life one in Transylvania. What were the things in gremlins? What were the what in gremlins? They were. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, this is an example. This is what your girlfriend said. Think. What were the things in gremlins called? I can't remember. Just. I mean, really. No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Just really, really think now, Carl. Just with all. With everything you've ever. With all the brainpower you've ever used, think what the things in gremlins were called. It's not there. There's a clue here. Oh, no. Yeah. What? Gremlins? Yeah. Play a record, car. This is XFM. Well, we're back and there's a few more people here. It's absolutely well done. Yeah, well observed. Yeah. Do you want to say hello? Hi, guys. And what are you doing here? This is Mark and Joe. Sorry, your name's what? Sorry, say the laugh again. Or what? Sco and belch. Yeah, that's right. Do you want to explain that? No. From the drinking games, I imagine. Yeah, worse names than that. But it's radio saying. Sure. Now, you're presumably students. We've just. We just graduated. Well, we kind of graduated when we've been in work, like about a year or two. And what do you do? I work for a management consultancy. I work for distribution company up in Birmingham. What you're doing is a scavenger hunt and you're raising for cancer charity research. Right. And you've got to do. And this is. We're just helping out here because for 17,000 points, you have to get live on a tv or radio show. That's exactly it. Do you ever listen to XFM? I know of it, yeah. I've. I listened to a few times. Sure. What kind of music, what kind of sounds would you normally be into? I love cheesy radio. Sort of school disco, sort of, you know, 80 stuff. Sure. So what was your name again? Mark or sco? Sko. And your belts belch. And what sort of sounds would you be grooving to? Belt UK garage. Well, Craig David, a bit of house. Just very occasionally a bit of cheese. It depends what kind of mood I'm in. Yeah, now, you don't listen much, but you, I mean, kiss a celeb because. Yeah, we actually want to do that with you, Ricky. Is that right? No, that's not gonna happen with Ricky. But you know, Carl's now got his name mentioned in Heat magazine. Is that right? Well, that's not Carl. We'd love to see that. I mean, we don't a snog, Carl. But I mean, we were thinking if there was kind of female placenta here, we might be able to do something. But, um. What you saying? A female placenta? Well, if you've got one. Oh, present. Is that why they're on radio? I thought placenta. That's unlikely. I know. Right, now, what's the other things you got to do here? So what some of the things you've done already? Well, some of these worry me. Like start a fire in pudding Lane. We've done that already for 4500, 700 points. Well, I said we have done. We've been on. We've been on Phantom of the opera stage already. Have you? Yeah, we just asked staged all guy. That wasn't during the show actually. In actual fact, we also. He actually mentioned that. Yeah, we shouldn't speak about that too, but yeah, he was really kind less on. We've jumped in Trafalgar Square water with doing a sort of friends impersonation. So that was how many points for that? We got 2000 points for that. We got 8000 points for being on the stage at Phantom of the Opera and we get double that. We get like 18,000 points, which is almost the maximum for being here right now. Really? Yeah, obviously, I wouldn't worry about the little things. I'd go for the big. Yeah, that's it. We're not, we're not interested in little stuff. Want to go for the big stuff? So what were the big ones are get on stage with S club seven. That's not gonna happen, is it? What have you got till two six? Well, s club seven are on at the London arena at about 02:00 so good luck. I think it's gonna be very, very difficult on there, but I think so, yeah. Get in the vaults of a bank. Yeah. Some of these are bordering on the illegal. That's 20,000 points per day. Like get in a cage at London Zoo. Don't do that. I mean, there's 10,000 points, but don't do it unless it's a penguin cage. That's what we were hoping just some. Kind of timid animal we might be all right with. Yeah. Anyone's got any good ideas for sort of funky things to do on air, then? Um. Okay, well, if you leave. If you leave your number and anyone calls in, they can help you then. Well, maybe. Maybe some of us. Club seven, we love them to be. If they are, it is for charity and the points get awarded into money for colon cancer, cancer research. So it'd be absolutely fantastic if we could. Yeah. So, Bradley, John, Tina, if you're listening. Yeah, if you're listening or any celebrity out there who's a female celebrity, we need to. We need to snog them. It doesn't get lost. If we can. This is good for 7000 points. This looks like a good one. Play the organ in a church. That must be easy. Is that a metaphor? Yeah, but you know what church, it. Says the bigger the better. So it might be. That's gotta be euphemism. Yeah, it's gotta be, hasn't it? Yeah. Well, thanks very much. Good luck. Good luck, guys. Standing outside, Les Mis looking miss. That's going to happen. That's good, man. A big gun type thing on the HMS Belfast. Well, we've got a big gun. It's just finding the boat, which is the problem. Calm down. What was your name? Bo. Thanks very much. The streets. Let's push things forward on XFM 104.9, the home of charity. That's true enough. Yeah. I've got to slow down because I'm doing a little bit too much for charity. I've got to worry about myself sooner or later. No, come on, we're halfway through white bam, man. We were indeed, yes. Getting Carl's views on some of the big stories of the week from the news. Carl, what do you make of the fact that the british Olympic curling team won a gold medal? Watch that. Uh huh. I thought it was really good. The only thing that's getting on my nerves now is like, is that a trombone? That was me moving this microphone. Right. Amazing noise. The only thing is that shouldn't sound like that, should it? That's incredible. What a shoddy Tim pot station this is. Well, we know that. Sorry, Carl. Go on. Is like in all the papers now, in like the, you know, the star and the sun. All week they've been like traipsing models over a bit of granite. Do you know like how those things are made out of granite, the things they throw. Oh, yeah. And it just. That bit annoys me. Okay, the Daily Star. No, the way that, you know, this sport, nobody had ever sort of heard of it. A couple of weeks ago, we win a gold medal. Yeah. And now in the papers, it's like they've gone crazy. They've gone curling mad. Yeah. Good game now. Yeah, good. Okay, next. All right, good. Let me see. Let me see. What about the fact that the world's tallest man is living in a semi in Nieston? Something that someone told me in the week is that. Do you know all these tall people, like this guy? Yeah. Which is a bit weird. They've only just found him, considering he's the tallest man. Someone. Told me that. Do you know the guy who was in James Bond? The big bloke? Yeah. Jaws. He's got the same illness as this bloke. Right. And what it is, it's called tall. It's something from tall. You've got a small tumor or something just behind this part of your head. Yes. Oh, yeah. Just sort of in the middle of your eyes. Yeah. And the pressure on that makes you grow really tall or something. Yeah. He needs to get it sorted. That's your advice to him, get it sorted. Okay. Very finally, Carl, this is important. This is them just projecting into the future. Just projecting into the future. Now, Cayman. Apparently, global warming will bring sizzling summers and weird wildlife to Great Britain in the future. You worried about that? Soon. Soon enough for you to worry. Yeah, it's pretty worrying. Okay. You don't. You wouldn't prefer it to be sunny here all the time? No, because with hot weather comes weird spiders and that. See, I always think we're quite lucky. Yeah. If you live in Australia, you might have the sun and stuff, but you've got, like, deadly snakes. Yeah. Which are deaf. Did you know snakes are deaf? Snakes are deaf. They don't have his. Okay, so you're all right walking about behind them? Yeah. But if they see you ahead of you, you're in trouble. But, yeah, with places like Australia, you know, people go, it's great sunny, but they don't talk about the spiders and. They keep the spiders. So I think we've got a bit of the both the best world. So you worried, though, about in the future, vultures flying through the sky? We've got various creepy crawly snakes. You can talk about that. Yeah. Well, there's a load. I saw something in the news in a week that a load of sparrows or something was somewhere. Maybe that's the start. That's an interesting story. Was that front page or, there's a load of sparrows somewhere. Read all about it sparrows somewhere. Sparrow somewhere. Load of sparrows somewhere. Somewhere. Excellent. That's. That's. That's Carl giving his views on the news. Don't do that next week. Why not? Why? Pressure. It's not pressure. You did brilliantly. Lost profits there on XFM 104.9. Now, I like that. It rocks. Atmosphere. It's good. But it's called the fake sound of progress. I know. See, what always annoys me is when people, they dismiss, you know, say, enrique angles. Yes. Current number one. Great song. Good video, brilliant video. And they say, oh, it's rubbish and all that. But I think that songs with titles like a fake sign of progress. Yeah, much more something to get on your hobby horse about what has happened. Bad lyrics by good artists is always worse than. Or if you work for the record company or you worked on that video. Because he's got the money in the girl. And then Mickey rock beats him up, right, as a fight. You just see him knock him over. And then it cuts the next scene. It's night, it's not in the desert. There's loads of police cars. They're not doing anything. They're just standing there somehow. He's probably donut. He's dying of injuries. But I don't know what happened. They don't. What has happened in that video. I think if you heard the twelve inch mix, there's a whole bunch of other sequences to explain why. Yeah, I mean, we all think all that. We think that he stole the girl off Mickey. I think he stole the girl off Mickey Rourke. As well as some money. Some money. Mickey's tracked him down. Yeah. And he's thinking, I'm gonna stop running. I'm gonna face Mickey. This time he does. And then boom, you're right, it cuts. And suddenly the police have shot him. Or I don't know where they are. Don't know what. The police seem to be leaving him to die in there. See, I thought. I thought they'd called the police because the. The sort of like the melee, but Mickey rocks off with his gang. The police are going, well, you know, where are. There's no evidence. They go, well, look, he's dying. They're going, but how did he die? How is he dying? Is not. He's a bit wet for the know. In rock, though, Rick. I imagine he's stitched Enrique up already. Framed him or something, or always. He's no. Sort of like ninja stuff. And there's lots of internal injuries that aren't immediately anyone. If you were involved with perhaps the making of that video, or indeed you are. Enrique Ingles. Yes. Give us a ring if you're around. Come on, just. Just fill us in. I'd rather play some adverts now than. I'd love to play some adverts, Rick. But I'll tell you this. I'd also like to tell the listeners that coming very soon on XFM, some huge news about Carl that will rock. The cap of Idol. It's gonna be an ongoing saga. Gomez. Shot. Shot. Good track, good band. But I'll tell you what, in the second hour, I just want to play classics. I'd love to hear. I want to play some cure. New order Smith. Sure. Do you know, I mean, some. You know, we played Nirvana earlier, but it's not enough for me, Steve. No, you need your fix. I want. I do. Well, it's that point in the show. Now, song for the lovers. One of my favorite singers. What? Probably one of most beautiful singer songwriters of all time. Well, you don't mean that like, you don't mean. He's a good looking bloke. Can you fancy him? I mean, I just want to kill that Rick, because otherwise that would. Yeah. What you mean is that the songs he writes are beautiful. Yeah. You can take or leave him as a bloke. And I've got, I've got. He's written such brilliant classics with his lovely ass as. Misinterpret. Oh God. He wrote galveston. He wrote Wichita lineman, MacArthur park. And just to tickle him down below. What? I don't know what. And this is a song, one of my beautiful songs I've ever heard. It's often ten easy pieces, which is just him doing the versions that he gave to other people on piano. And this is called if these old wolves could speak. And it is absolutely beautiful. Listen to this. If these old walls could speak by Jimmy Webb. Might play another track off that later if we got time. What, today? Yeah, well, maybe. Or maybe next week. We've got lots to pack in. We've got things like new order cure. I'm just hoping that all those kind of new metal fans, Rick, can just calm down for a second, you know? Yeah. And just enjoy that for what it was. Yeah. They're not. Their snobbery is not going to prevent them from enjoying. I hope they can just leave it on for 2 hours for our show. Exactly. We try and, you know, we get triumphant. Lots of new metal. Can I just say, Ian Canfield is here tonight, moving from Fridays. Right. What the hell does he think he's doing? He's just offering up information now. No, it's just that you were talking about the new metlus and now seems like a good time. Carlisle, you're here for our amusement. Yeah. You don't. You don't sort of come in any time you want. When we decide it's time to sort of have some fun at your expense, then we'll let you know. But otherwise, this. When we're not here to help other dj's or even this station. We don't give a fuck about this. See, this is what my girlfriend said. What's that? We should listen to her. She knows what she's talking about. Clearly. Now put your microphone down. She said they just wheel you out when they need you. Switch your microphone off, Carl, and let us finish what we were saying. Right. Just what we're saying. Rick. Um, Ian Canfield has got a rock show. Oh, right. You're starting today. 4 hours of pure rock. Yeah, he's probably here smoking, drinking Jack Daniels and just like having pictures of Vance put up around the mood. Then they go out and rock. Carl, don't be silly. Turn your microphone on. We're joking. It was uh. It was. Is that right? When's he on? Eight till twelve tonight. 4 hours of rock. Lovely. Listen, um, some big classics coming up. Plus huge news about. You really want some? I'm tired of the music and chat. Please play some more ads, Carl. Please. Cure on XFM 104.9. That's what it's all about, Steve. Absolutely. Classics. Yeah, we've got some more classics coming up. Looking forward to them. Now, when we were talking to Carl in the week, things were talking to Carly is that you come up with something that's sort of like um, quite innocent. And he goes, ah, well that wants. Right? And you realize that it's comedy dynamite. He doesn't know it, but we want to go save it. And he let out. You were filling in a form, weren't you? It was all about your girlfriend thinking you're a div. And it's happened before, isn't it? Because she came home and you'd filled out a form to get a job once, hadn't you? Yeah. What was that for? Gravanada telly. And on it. Well, let Karl explain. Yeah. You see, this is what annoys me with job applications. Because rather than just saying, do you want the job? And what can you bring to this business? Yeah, do you want the job? Is a good one. That's what I'm for, boys. Because if they say no, I don't think they want the job. Listen, go on. I mean, I presume with what you do, you have to take people on and stuff. Well, fight, you mean. You know, I mean. Yeah. And I think it's more important that you're willing to graft and put the hours in. Sure. Then say that, you know, you did well at school. Yes, sure. Because if I wanted to, I could have done well at school. Of course. I just. I just didn't want to. So where's this going? So you had the application form. So when it came to the qualifications bit and that, I couldn't fill them in because I didn't have any qualifications. And it was also asking about your languages. And I put down English, quite good. English. Quite good. Hahaha. And his girlfriend came over and seen the form that he'd sent off. This was a copy of it. And so she went, oh, you know what I mean? So that's what started, you know, the disappointment. So they're gonna get that and think that you're not English. I don't think I've got. It was ages ago. Right. How long ago was it? Oh, it was when I was still in Manchester. So five years ago. I don't think you got to know. There could be a long list. I mean, there's probably a lot of admin problems in that organization, but they probably. What I meant by is that me? You know, I can speak English, but I don't know all these long words that people use all the time. Yeah. Oh, God. Oh, can I just tell this quickly? In the week I'm talking to you now, the listener usually I don't. Carl said, oh, about embarrassing him on air and that, and he's worried about his education and he was worried about not knowing long words, like we come up with any long words and he said, no, I was scared you were going to ask me about someone. And he's an eastern european leader, his surname is Milosevic. And Carl said, so I learned it this week and learnt it. So you can't catch me out in case you start. I said, what? And he said, he thought about it. He went, Flobadan Milosevic. So what's his name? That's how Bill and Ben would address this leader. How would they have said it? Flobber. Damn, a lot of lobbies. What's his name? Slobodan. Yeah. Yeah. Well done. Anyway, Carl, you almost let it slip then as you were talking about your filling up that application form. There's some big news that everyone needs to know, which we were stunned by in the week. Although the more we sort of talk to you, the more it starts to fall into place. Yeah, but Carl, what's the story that. I haven't got me exam results from the GCSE's. He never turned up to get his exam results. And so how many did you take in the end? Because you weren't even sure about that worry. You think you took maths and English, don't you? Yeah. And you think you've handed in the artwork for art. Now, art was some continual assessment, wasn't it? Coursework. And what was it that you had you made? I made a man sort of putting his arms into a car. You made a model of a man putting his arms into a car. What was this? That one's passed. Was that homage to break ins in Manchester? Oh, look, he does what he sees. Yeah. So you've got that. That's safe. You definitely got that one. So you've taken art, you've taken English and maths, you think? So this is what we're going to do, listeners. We're going to try and find out his exam results for him and tell him next week we're going to call his school, we're going to try and track him down and we are going to have a little envelope and we are going to give Karl, at the age of 29, his O level results. GCSE's, yeah. Now, Carl, so you took maths, you think you took English? Do you remember turning up to do those? Do you remember sitting in the room filling in the forms? Okay. And how did you feel you did? I didn't. I don't think I did well. You don't think you did well, did you revise? No. Why didn't you revise? Cuz I don't really believe in it. Okay, well, it's just that if you don't know it, then you don't know it. You shouldn't have to start looking at. If I went to the doc, if I went to like the hospital. Yeah. And the doctor said, oh, you need your appendix out, but I'm gonna minute. I've just got to read up on it. Yeah, that isn't good enough. Okay. He should know and that's, that's the way I feel. To be fair, though, he did do the revision before. Yeah. They don't usually pass on, like maybe like when they're in practice. Yeah. Information they took in by osmosis. Yeah. Yeah. They bloke comes in and goes, can I just see what you did with that? You've passed? Yeah. Phew. That's a good one. Good job. I watch casualty. I just like the way, you know, the things that interest me. I remember things like snakes not having ears and stuff. Yeah, I didn't have to read about that. No, you just learned that you saw. On the teddy that you saw on that Ian Wright program. Yeah. Yeah. And this is what Karl said to me. He said, no, it's actually, I called Carl up in the week and Reese was with him. You know, Reese used to be exfm, and he took the phone and he went, carl's worried. I've seen that program. He said, snakes don't have ears. Right? He said, so you can creep up on them and pick them up. And he said, carl's worried. He said, how'd you ever put them down again? Because then they know that you're there. I woke up the other night quite. Late, worried about that. And I said to my girlfriend, I said, how do you put a snake down? What you talking about? I said, that Ian Wright thing. This guy managed to pick up a snake. And you know that thing where they clamp its head on a jar to get the poison out? I do know. Right. They did that, but they didn't show you how they got rid of it. And I thought it could really get nasty because it's obviously annoyed that you've had its head pressed in the jar. Yeah. Right. They hate that now. Especially as it's in front of their mates when you lift it off. Yeah. Right. You've got hold of it. Yeah. If you go to chuck it down, it's gonna turn on you. It's gonna go wild, isn't it? So I just wondered, well, what you. Do is you never put it down, Carl. Yeah. That's why. That's why that bloke has got about, you know, eleven or twelve just carrying him. Exactly. Yeah. You never put down. You sling it. Who cares? You just throw it, don't you, really far. That's not that I don't think you should throw. Carl, listen, don't worry. We're not asking you to get involved with snakes. We're just asking you did. You've done maths, you think? Yeah. Did. No revision for that? No. Okay, English, would you remember what it was? Did they ask you about Shakespeare? Did they ask you about. It was english language, not english literature, wasn't it? So it was expelling and so was it. No. Was it, was it like a comprehension? You read a passage now to ask questions on it. Was it. Did you have to write a short essay I don't know. I can't remember any of that. Okay. I did a science. Okay. Physics or chemistry? Physics. All right, well done. And this is all you think anything. You actually took that. You actually took physics GCSE. You think you're obliged to do a language, I think. Did you do French? I did French for a bit. I don't think you are. I don't think you have to do a language. You have a GCSE. I think you've got, well, English. Quite good. I think that's his language. He did. So you don't know about language, history, geography. Okay. But you just can't remember. You. I can't believe you can't remember turning up for these things because it's quite a big moment in people's lives. Is that thing that you've been working to all of your educational life? On the day that the things came out, I was working at a print, as a printer. Okay? And it was a really busy day. A lot of spelling mistakes. It was a really busy day. So you're bound to forget. Yeah, yeah. No, but I had to use gold ink that day. So you don't. You don't know. No. That's the biggie, innit? But it's tough. You've got to really get your rollers clean. Carl, player, record, mate. And good luck with the exam results. Hopefully we'll have them for you by next week. PJ Harvey on XFM 104.9, the home of the classics. Absolutely. Classics. Classics. Classics. Classics. Classics. Oggy, oggy, oggy. Oi, oi, oi. Wow. We were talking earlier about this as this book, they died young. And there's all these theories about these people, like famous people that aren't really dead. And I remember speaking to someone about this, okay? And they said to me, Bruce Lee is not dead. I said, it's not dead, right? I said, well, how do you know he's going, no, it was a whole big thing by the Hong Kong government. And he's actually working as an undercover cop in Hong Kong using his kung fu powers now. No, he's apparently faked his own death. Yeah. So that he could work undercover for the Hong Kong police, infiltrating gangs, the triads, that sort of thing. Now, my point is this, if you're going to use someone undercover in Hong Kong, right, you know, undercover cop, I suggest using the most famous Chinaman of all time. That that would be guarantee, yeah. Yeah. So, you know, when he's taken away a gang, they're going, you look a bit like Bruce Lee. He's going, no, no. I don't know. See this. This mustache? Wonky. Well, it's just. Just take my word for it, I'm not Bruce Lee. Right. Well, all that stuff he did when you punching us and kicking us and chop. Yes. But coincident. I'm not. It does look a bit like the stuff in my film. In his films. In his films, yeah. It's not. It does. Coincidence? No. Yeah. I'm not sounding bad here, not trying to offend anyone, but they do all right. They do all look. No, no, no, I've gone. No. You know, we're having a serious chat. Right? I'm not, you know, I'm not here to upset anyone. Why? And what I'm saying is, over here. I'm so sorry, I'm not. Yeah, but you know me, I'm not. I'm not. Right. You're not a racialist? No. What do you mean? You. Are you saying or people all look alike. Well, look at the people over here. Right? Yeah. No, you've got ginger people. Oh. You've got people with black hair. You've got people who are fat, people who are thin. But they're also sort of fit, which isn't a bad thing. They all do that sort of thing in the park. They're all fit. It's a place where black hair. I mean, when they come here, they set pictures of people with ginger hair, don't they? Because they don't get them over there. That's what I'm saying. So calm down. So you're saying that Bruce Lee, the most famous chinese movie star of all. Time, they can't tell him apart. Other trial members would. How are they. I mean, how are they going about the business at all? What I'm saying is, how would they even realize. Yeah, that was the guy. What they have to do. We're numbers in, you know, because there's. There's. There's a billion. No, but when. You know. So what? Oh, I see. They can tell each other apart, can they? Well, they got signals. I. This is amazing. Simon. Simon. Which one of you, just raise your hand. Chang. Which one's Chang? Chang. Good, yeah. Oh, it must be murder, mustn't it? Just people going into the wrong houses all the time, getting off with their mates wives. It must be a nightmare. Please don't complain. He doesn't know what he's doing, so I'm really sorry to anyone. He honestly does not know what he's saying. XFM 104.9. Yeah, but what I'm saying is. Go on. I don't think I am offending anyone. Okay, fine. That's all right then. And you know that I wouldn't want to do that. No, I know you don't. Oh, no. Oh, I know I said, right? If you got kids in the car, turn your radio. So before you make any potentially racist remarks, just point out if you are listening and you might be oriental, please don't take offense. Or go. Oh, you know what I mean? Can't play a record. Ricky's having a heart attack. Well, the music of tomorrow is here. That's true enough. Yeah, Exo. It's been some sort of muck up with the post, Rick. A lot of the times when I played hip hop. Hooray. My hip hop track of the week. Yeah, you've sort of scoffed. You thought that maybe I don't have credibility amongst the hip hop fraternity. No, it's just the way you dance. Well, it's merely the way you dance that worries me because people can't see it, really. And it's sort of like, imagine if Mister Bean thought he was in d twelve, you know? I mean it's. It's that sort of. And I don't diss you. I mean, I know you're hip hop. Appreciator, you know, I wouldn't expect you to diss me. I'm a black queen. But the point is that I just. There's a little something that Carl's got on take for you that I think might change your opinion of my whole hip hop credibility. Now, I've told you the best type. Is it not so. Not so much, Carl. Just play, just play, y'all. 1212. We are the dilated people chilling on hip hop. Hooray. That's right, with Steve Merchant, y'all. XFM 104.9 LA to London. Dilated people expanding them all day now. It was just when I was hanging out with my homies. No, did you. They come in the week. They were in the week. I think somebody got him to do. It for him, you know? No, that was when I was just. I was just hanging in the crib with them. No, that's very nice. And the guys just put. Just laid down some beats for me. Yeah, just laid down some vocals and I gave them Max respect for it, you know, the place was mad deep with girls at the time. I assume you're gonna play donated peoples this week. Well, maybe. Yeah, let's play it, Carl. That's very good. Respect, guys. Cheers very much out of here. Yeah, guys, just Max in there. Lovely. Good to hear from them. Good to hear from the boys. I'll probably be heading over to LA, NYPD, and just. Just, you know, chilling with them. I'd love them to meet you. I'd love them to meet you. We would hang out. I know all the jokes I think. They do on MTV or like being dilated peoples. And they come and they make us three. Wouldn't that be great? I told you before, I've always remembered the words of snoop doggy dog. Yeah, bitches, a bitch in the hose, a hoe. But if a man be acting like a bitch, he's a bitch ass homie. Yeah, those are the words from the street. I would be like you. You two had won a competition or something. Do you know? I mean, like that. I just don't think you can. You can believe it, that I'd just be hanging out, you know, so like in the crib, people of courage, and. You get a chance to meet your favorite. It'd be amazing, wouldn't it? Listen, we were talking earlier about the fact that Bruce Lee, and it's a well known fact. Yeah. He faked his own death so he could continue his undercover police work as opposed to being. Because no one was different to anyone else. I was talking to someone as well recently who utterly convinced, and you get this quite a lot, don't you? Especially Americans, that Elvis Presley is still alive. Yeah. And I think, wasn't there some statistic, like more people believed Elvis was alive than thought, than believed evolution? Was that right? Yes. No, no, no, it's something worse than that. It's. It could be something. It was something like that. It's something like. I don't know, it's something like 42% of Americans believe that Elvis Presley is faked his own death and is still alive. Right. Yeah. And there's this whole book that's been written about it because, Carl, you might be interested in this. I know you're always fascinated by things that have been written down and therefore a gospel. Yeah. And you don't have to revise yourself, you just learn off. Right. Apparently the reason Elvis is still alive is that there's a number of pieces of evidence. One is that none of his family could agree which colour pajamas he was wearing when he died. That's evidence, apparently. Apparently. You know, he was an honorary member of the FBI. Well, apparently his signature appears on FBI documents well into the eighties, long after he should have died. Apparently no one can agree. There was sums of money. Yeah. A lot of fat people in dungarees have seen him. Yeah. There's a number of the sums of money which apparently only he could have given authority to have transferred to other bank accounts they've moved. So this is all evidence that Elvis is still alive. And a lot people saying, well, of course the thing is the pressures of fame were too much for him that he faked his own death so that he no longer had to be this huge icon, you know, he could live an ordinary life. And my query has always been this. If Elvis faked his own death, do you think that the method he'd have chosen is to have shat himself to death whilst on the toilet? Yeah, yeah, but because he picked that, nobody will doubt it. Elvis went to the FBI. Yeah. What do you make of it exactly? So what we're saying, Carl, is that there was lots of methods open to him, you know, I mean it's all he didn't go to his secret. Oh, I'm afraid I want, I want to fake my own death. I mean. And I go, yeah, yeah. What methods have you got? I like to be found shit myself down the toilet. You like to do what? I want a big fat mother just shitting myself to death. Right. This is a good idea. I'm just wondering if there's maybe something a little bit more glamorous for your favorite. Doesn't mean you could take a bully for the president, huh? What? Shit all over him just. No, no crap at all. No, you just take a bullet for him. Or you could. There has to be shit involved. Why is it gotta be has machine involved? Why is there gotta be crap? I wondered make it happen. Yeah, it's probably cow heading handler. Yeah, he's worried about the things we say. Yeah. Geez, we haven't offended 1.2 billion p. Yeah. A fifth of the planet. So Carl, what do you make of it then? Do you say Elvis is alive? Is. Am I getting him mixed up with someone else? Because all Elvis our business is look alike. Because now that is true. A lot of Elvis's do look alike. That's safe on his gravestone. Yeah. Didn't they get his name wrong? Or is that his brother? Who's his brother? Um, Aaron. That's his middle name. You're not an Elvis, um, kind of expert, are you? Hold on. Was Elvis, was. Wasn't Elvis one of a twin that. Yeah, that died and I'm sure they got his name wrong on a grave or something. I don't know. But that's so that's consequently that's proof he's still alive. The thing with a still alive thing. Like I say, he picked that awkward death because nobody would be saying, hang on a minute. Going around upsetting the family, wanting to talk about it, because they'd be embarrassed to be sane, you know, he was found sort of. Yeah. In a pile of mess, weighing 25 stone. Yeah. So. Because you notice he also expanded to a huge size as well, so he was just a huge fat blob of a man. He also did that to add, you know, extra to the glamour. I don't quite understand all this. These people who fake the deaths because. Well, a lot of them don't. A lot of them don't. Kyle, this is what. This is what? In a roundabout way, we're saying. We're saying that a lot of people that say people fake that they didn't like Bruce Lee and James Dean and Elvis Presley. We're saying they didn't fake. He did die, didn't he? His head came off. There is a light when it goes out. The Smiths XFM 104.9 nearly through. Absolutely. 2 hours of chat. Great music. Bloody good music. Carl, of course, speaking before. Thanks, by the way, you know, when he was going about Mowgli, you know, turned on Mowgli and you said, what are the Gremlins called? Yeah. You thinking of gremlins? Yeah. Yeah. I know what you're thinking. I know, to be fair, but my. Girlfriend won't be listening now, so she'll still think I'm bit daft. She. Why? Why would she ever think that? How long have you been going out with her? Well, then, why would she ever think you're daft? That's the only stupid thing you've ever said, that. The Mogwai thing. Why would she ever think she's going out with a. To be honest, retard. I think. I think it's very beautiful relationship you must have, you know, because it's odd, like, I mean, she's a professional journalist or whatever. Yeah. You know, and she works for. Is it radio five or something? Never even quite good, is it? Is English quite good, her. Really good. Yeah. So. And did she do her exams? Yeah. Quite bright. Sure. So, what do you bring to the relationship? I think take the pressure off her. Take the pressure off her to do what? You know, like when she's had a stressful day and she comes home, talks. To me, I think, yeah, you would relax me. And that's the truth, honestly. But you know, Carl, you can just. He can just go, wow. It's all right, you know. I mean, he doesn't you don't get stressed. He sits in his little booth now. He doesn't talk to anyone, his little sound booth all the week. And you just. You're in your own little world, aren't you? Well, it's interesting because I wonder sometimes what your aspirations are. I was thinking this. I was watching a repeat of family fortune on challenge tv last night, and it was sort of mid eighties one. And I don't know if it's still the case, but it was the aspirations of the contestants. So kind of it was like, and what's your hobby? Well, you know, like to go out when it's nice weather and stay in. Well, if you. Not, if you win 2000 pounds, you'd probably be going out when it's nice, can't you? Yeah. And she was like, well. And I, you know, I sometimes like to watch tv, you know, and I was thinking, wow, man, you've really got some incredible. It's just like that. I'm. You're just waiting to die, aren't you? What I feel sorry for, right? Two things, you know, in, like, stars in their eyes, and you get a little fellow, and he's gutting fish in a, some sort of factory in Bolton, and he comes on and he does, you know, something like Bobby Darren, okay? And he's. And Matthew Kelly comes out after he goes, well, I don't think you'll be going back to the fish factory. You will. You will be going back. You will. Straight back. Yeah. Let's think about Kelly, because that's a nice thing to do. I'm trying to think, um. Trying to think of all the stars in their eyes, contestants that have gone on to great things. What happened? That little fender look like the little alsatian pup that did Christa Burr. It is really like Christopher. He looked like he had problems. Well, I. Yeah. Now, what was it? Is Ian Moore, his name was. Now, now, he was interesting. My friend bought me, as an ironic gift for my birthday, he bought me the live video of Ian Moore. You'll be pleased to know that lady Red was on there. But it was really said Ian Moore naturally. I didn't know it was too big for him as well. Of course, it was ludicrous. But I don't know if that meant Ian Moore naturally. Like, we all know this guy. Is this Ian Moore? Yeah. Or was it Ian Moore? He's no longer being Christa Burr. He's just natural. What did he sound like when he wasn't being Christa Burr? Christa Burr. Did he really? Because he met him, didn't he? Yeah. Well, Christopher, I think Christopher couldn't wait to get back on the telly. Well, the thing is, I think. I think Ian Moore is actually earning more than Christopher now. I think they could have got Christaber on there. Yeah. You can get Christabur for a thousand pounds, but Ian Moore's going up for 1200 now just to the PI, to, you know, adapt. But he does lady, mate, there's all the hits he does. Don't pay the ferry, man. Yeah. Don't even set a price. There's all those. Interestingly, I saw him interview once, and lady in Red is not his favorite song. You're joking. It's bizarre, isn't it? But he was only gonna play that if it was the fat ginger. Sarah Ferguson. Oh, yeah, yeah. It was only if she was wearing some red. He was only gonna play that way. Yeah. It was a live thing. And he was only play that if she was wearing red or something. Right. Dinner freckles. No. So it. Luckily, she had a red. That must have clashed with her a bit. Yeah. A red scarf on. On her face. And the highlights in your hair that catch the light. Yeah. Such a beautiful lyric. Never seen. Look, he's a lovely. The thing is, right, he misses a rhyme. There he goes. I asked you to dance. Looking for a little romance now he can say dance. I met a man once in a. In a bar. I was talking to him. For some reason, I was annoyed by him. I always wind up by him. And I said that I'd written lady in red, and I never got any money for it because I found that he was like a music lawyer. And he went, well, give me a call. I'll investigate that. He was actually gonna do it for me. I love the idea of that. Why did you say that? Really bored. And I didn't like him much. And I was just. And I thought that was. Why did you choose lady in red, though? Because I think I was singing it with a friend of mine. And you went, oh, good voice. And, yeah, I wrote this. What it pub is this. It was north, is it? Yeah. Never seen look as lovely as you did tonight. So, anyway, those. That's enough of my Christopher anecdotes. Yeah. That's very much the end of the show. And it's been a great. It's been a great show. Have I got time for a song for the lovers or if I missed that? No. Yeah. What are you gonna play? We're gonna play. What, are you gonna play a song now? And then we've got time for after. Yeah, I better dig it out. What have you chosen? I'll keep it going. Well, a friend of mine who keeps making me look compilations is stuck on an old Tom waits track, which is from his first album, one that I've not listened to for. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Can anyone hear me? Yeah. Yeah, he's just getting out of his bag now because we weren't. We weren't prepared for this. We sort of ran out of time. We're having such a great time with the philosophy of car me, you know, I'll just gonna tell you now. You know we're still on air, don't you? Before it gets too casual, you know, we are still broadcasting to the capital. Okay. What do you fancy doing with your future? Well, once I've made all that money from suing Krista Burr. No, you know my future. I'm living my future. Wanted to have some good mates like yourself and Ricky. Yeah, Kylo wanted to be on the radio. We're gonna be great songs. We're like the three Musketeers. Me, you. And it's like. We're like the original rat pack. We're oceans eleven. I'm Sinatra. You're Sammy Davis Junior, and you're. What's his name? D. Martin, aren't you? Yeah. Or Joey Lawrence. What's his name? Joey Lawrence. Not Joey Lawrence. Joey Bishop. Joey Deacon. Joey Deacon. Your dad said the ending on the old one's better than the new one. We should definitely get your dad in, man. That would be just dynamite. When people get tired of you, we've got the whole Pilkington family, the whole gene pool. No, Carl, if we got time for this now, really, mate, to be fair. Okay, strike number one. Now, interestingly, about Tom waits is that, um. This is from his first album. And he doesn't sound like that kind of gruff, you know, lived in guy, that he wants something of a crooner. Yeah, but this is a track called old 55, which, bizarrely, I think might be covered by the. The Eagles. But anyway, so I think it's really lovely. Beautiful track. I'll see you next week. And we'll see you next time. Say goodbye, Carl. So, yeah, say sorry for effie offended anyone. I didn't. If I say sorry, that's saying I'm guilty.",
