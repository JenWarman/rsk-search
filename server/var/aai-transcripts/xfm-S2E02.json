  "text": "Back to form there, Oasis. And little by little, this is XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. Who are you? My name's Steve Mochi. Good to see you. Thanks. With us, the producer in the studio is Carl Pilton and he'll be doing the buttons. Yeah, you made a good effort there, but once again, word to your enemy and they defeated you once again, just run out of steam with the sentences. Every week I think, well, I'm really gonna make an effort now. I'm gonna. I've chosen some records. That's it. That's as far as it goes, isn't it? Yeah. Maybe you should write out what you're gonna say at the top of the show. Write that out. I like to keep a little bit of, you know, a little bit of. Something, a little bit spark, little bit of liveliness to it. Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. How are you? Good, yeah, it's great. It's great to be out of the house again. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Just, I was gonna say, because we've been doing this for a long time now with a little break, but XFM are bringing new listeners all the time. I've heard four or five a week. Really? Yeah. New listeners tuning to XFM radio. Beware. Yeah, yeah. And we might take it for granted, the people that know who we are know who you are know Carl is. Now, if you, you know, if you're a regular, then you know exactly who we are. But for those of you who don't, I'm Ricky Gervais. Ricky Gervais, BAFTA award winning actor and writer. Steve Merchant friend of yours. Yeah, yeah. And this is the important thing. Karl Pilkington. Absolutely. I say producer. He was the bloke who was lumbered with a job. When I said, listen, I see, I used to run the desk in the old days. I used to press the buttons and run the desk and everything. And now I said, listen, I've been on the telly. I do not press my own buttons. And Carl said, well, I don't really work weekends. And they went, well, you do if you want to keep your job. Absolutely. And we were lumbered with him. And then we discovered that he's not just a little like a little dork, a little mankey sort of idiot. He's got. He's got nice shirt. He's got. You know what I mean? He's got something else. He brings another dimension. Yeah, yeah. And he started having a look, little chat, and we discovered that he. Quite a lot to say. Well, I think actually. Right. And I think I was wondering maybe we should maybe play another tune. But after that, I just think we should re familiarize our radio audience with Carl. And any new listeners just get, you know, somehow going to let them get to know the real Carl again. Well, if you are new, you'll find that we like some old songs and new songs, some chit chat. We get serious sometimes. There's some tears and some laughter. We kicked off with Oasis new one. Little by little. We're going to go back in time now to Iggy Pop and his stooges with I'm bored Iggy Pop on board on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant here. Yeah. Little Carl Pilkington. Well, to reintroduce or introduce people for the first time to Carl, I think we should have a. Yeah, maybe sort. Of a kind of a quick Q and a, Carl. And we don't need sort of lengthy answers from you. We don't need lots of detail, you know, can we just a couple of sentences just to get who you are. Yeah. So firstly, name, obviously, Carl Pilkington. Age, Carl. I'll be 30 next month. Really? This month? No, next. Where are we? I don't think we need to ask anyone questions. That's it. Welcome to the world of Carl. Oh, I thought it would take three or four. But, you know, we can't really leave it there because we haven't got enough else to do to build up the 2 hours. So let's pursue this line of inquiry. Yeah. So, um, age. What was the age, Carl, in a couple? Were you born? I'll be 72. Right. What month? What day? I'm on the cusp. You're on the cusp of the day. Well, 23 September. Okay. So anyway. Okay, right, good. I know you were talking there about, obviously a star sign where you on the cusp. Yeah. You believe in that, do you? No. You don't believe in star signs? No, not really. But you do believe in ghosts. I understand. Thing you've got, how many, how many different star signs are they? Twelve in it. Right. And then you got like loads of people. Yeah. You do the math. So they saying that, you know, there's only twelve different sorts of people in the world. Exactly. That's exactly right. It's, it's made up. It's made up nonsense. It's non science, it's pseudoscience. It's. Yes, it's, it's, it's. It's hairy man and dyed hair. Women. Science. Yes, and it. All right, yeah. Anyway, back to you, Carl. Where were you born in? In Manchester. Okay, what GCSE results did you get? I got. Was that an e in history? And how did you find out that information? You found out because you thought you didn't. You couldn't remember what you got. You didn't turn up and you thought you'd done about three, one of which wasn't history. And actually, yeah, you didn't. I'm telling you didn't because we checked. You did one, you turned up for history. You did history, you got on earth. They did art. I made a little claim on. Yeah, you've got a register for O levels, you don't just do it and then phone up, say, I was that. And I go, I'm sending you a clay man. Yeah, it's all thing. There's forms to fill out and things like that, Carl. Anyway, who was your closest childhood friend? Closest at what age? Well, when you were young. When you were young, I remember this. It'S a fella, someone making in it, this. Well, he wasn't really a close mate. Darren Buckley was me. Darren Buckley? Yeah. Tell us briefly about Darren. I forgot about Darren. He's the one who. All the girls liked him. He had permed air. He said I was there like a footballer. Sure. Were you jealous of him? It was a copper. Did you hang around with Darren, like in the hope of getting maybe his kind of cast offs? Nah. It's weird with me, and I wasn't that bothered about having loads of mates and that. I saw I had lots of mates, but I could do without them. You had a magpie, didn't you? I was happy playing with my magpie. Yeah. What happened to him? Flew away. Yeah, but I wasn't bothered because it was giving me grief towards the end, wasn't it? It was popping me grifter tires and that, flying down, pecking me head. Sure. Now, you went to school with a number of different interesting people, some of. Whom, I understand, had big heads and webbed toes, is that right? Yet they were not related to each other and they weren't friends with each other. Why weren't they friends with each other? Because that'd be obvious. Did they wear shoes or did they walk around in there? In their web terms, were they good at swimming? Were they good at swimming? I don't know. I don't think they ever, ever went swimming. Did they ever talk? Did they ever look over each other and think, yeah, we should hang out more? I told you something in the week as well. There's another lad at school at a pigeon chest. Can we come back to this? I think we should play a record, Carl, because I think we've hooked them now. I think there's no one switching off now, Rick. No player record. Coffee and tv. Carla, I said it's not the best player song when it was playing, you know, don't diss it. But you know, it's not the best one. I mean, that's fact. Sure. You know, Carl went like a video, though, a little milk carton. Yeah, it sounds tragic in it. He went in there, this is all to himself. I'm not even joined in. And then he went, yeah, but it's all right at the end. He goes to every finds a little girl milk carton. Just lives out a little thing. And is. Is that like you on your paper around that little milk carton? Walking around like that? I imagine you. Oh, people don't know about. If you just tuned in. Carl had a paper round. It's his favorite job ever, and he. Maintains it's the best job he's ever had. And it. Carl, go on. I don't know what's so weird about that. It's a paper round. Yeah, but forget most fulfilling. Look at the way it works, right? You. You get out the way at the start of the day, so you got the rest of the day to yourself. Same as signing on your own. Your own boss. You know I was signing on. Well, you're not your own boss. The guy. The news agency. Yeah. That's great. You've proven me wrong. Yeah, that's great. Yeah. Not really. Would that stand up in court? Well, you were found with the dagger. Yeah. Was I? When are we. When are we playing the new game? Oh, Carl's got a new game. Carl's very excited. Yeah, right. The freaks used to go, you had people with big heads, two web feet, didn't hang around, so that would be too obvious. You had a fellow with a pigeon chest. Yeah. What's the story with a pigeon chest? Dunno how it happened. It was like. It looked like somebody sort of hit him on the back with a big hammer and it had come out at the front. Yeah. And I've never seen it since. Could that have been the answer? What? Why is why? Possibly, I suppose. In your neck of the woods. Yeah. Don't know. Never asked him. It's just come back to haunt you, has it? The pigeon chest? No, it's just that, you know, when you. When you mentioned about kids at school, I forgot all about him. He's talking about the kids with the web feet and the big heads. Yeah. And I forgot about the little older pigeon boy. Yeah, pigeon. Yeah. Well, listen, I'm a big fan of that tv show. It's on digital tv a lot. People won't have it, but inside the actors studio. With James Lipton. Yeah. And he interviews lots of big Hollywood stars. And he always asks them these same questions at the end. Can I just run a few of them past you? Okay, so if you could do any other profession other than the one you do now, what profession would you do? Can you just change that to apart from a paper round? Apart from a paper round, you do any other profession, Carl. And it doesn't matter about, like. Doesn't matter if you've got the skills or anything. In an ideal world, if you had the ability. Well, I think I'm about to buy somewhere, so I reckon something, you know, using tools and, like, doing a bit of plumbing and that. So, a plumber. Well, sort of an all rounder. Right, right. Handy handyman. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think, you know, you don't get paid that much, but it's useful in it. So you get your own show. Couldn't you, with Carol Smiley eventually? Well, all that, but the money that you don't make, you save by not having to pay someone else to do the chores. Right. I don't know what that sentence meant. Right, right. No, a plumber. How much. How much is the average plumber on. The money you don't make, you save on not getting someone else to do it? Now, just think of that. No, break that sentence down. Are there any. Sorry, Rick. Sorry, but people live in glass houses anyway, let's just go back to Lipton quickly. We've got a couple of. To get through here. So, your favorite noise or sound? Favorite sound or noise? Is it me? It's not me. It's not me. Are you sure? It's not me, Carl? Noise. Elvis in the ghetto. The sound of Elvis. Elvis in the ghetto. Brilliant. And your least favorite noise or sound? I don't think it should really be records and music. Noises, things that you hear at home or whatever. Maybe like a sound of a. The least favorite noise. Least favorite. The sound of probably, like, ghosts, fire engines and that. Right. That's. That's annoying. Except if your house was on fire, presumably. I think it's been unnecessary. You think they're just doing it to warm people up. I live on, like, a busy street and it's happening all the time and it's. It is like, just sort of have a blast of it. And people will hear it. You have to keep it going. Yeah, sure. So that is. And if heaven exists, Carl, when you get to the pearly gates, what would you like God to say to you as he welcomes you into heaven? Would you like God to say to you. Who asks these, what shows this? It's a program where celebrities are interviewed by a guy, an american interviewer, and he always asks these questions at the very end, what would I say to God? What would you say to God if you believed in heaven, and if heaven exists, when you eventually go up to heaven and you're welcomed in through the. Gatesy t shirt and, yeah, what do. You want God to say to you as he welcomes you in? Say, all right, dunno. Just be friendly. I love the way feeder. Come back around on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. But who are you? Oh, thanks for asking, Rick. Steve Merchant with us. Carl Pilgrim. Well, Carl, now, I know I shouldn't, but I've met Carl in the week. He starts saying things like, oh, is this loud? I go, save it, save it. And we just sit there. I'm scared to talk in case he comes up. But you did tell me a couple little things, didn't you? True stories that, you know, that I mean, I enjoy. Can you tell Stephen about the doctor? Right. Oh, God. What's, what, is this something that happened to a friend of yours? Or is this. No, no, I read about it. You read about it? Okay, there's this little lad, right? Okay, first of all, it's years ago, right? They didn't have decent doctors in like, every town and that. Yeah. And this little kid is dead ill, right? Yeah. And the local doctor, well, there's a. Phone call involved, so I don't really give the impression that it's like many medieval times. Yeah, yeah, but I didn't say that. I just said it's years ago. So this kid's ill, right? Yeah. And he's lying in the bed and he's all like all going, funny color and that, and his mom says, I'm gonna get the local doctor around. The local doctor comes around and I don't know what's up with him. He said to leave it with me. He said, I'll phone up a top doctor who was in America or somewhere like that. And so he goes to the phone in his office and he calls America because it's years ago. The phone line isn't that good. It's all crackling, right? So he's talking to the doctor and he's saying, I've got this kid, he's a funny color and, you know, he's really weak in that. He's not giving him much to go on, right? Sure. So. So the american doctor, right? Yeah. He goes, yeah, what you want to do? And it's all breaking up, right? Because what you got to do, you go, breaking up. You've got to give him some parrot's blood, right? Some parrot split. Well, that's what he thought he said, but the line was really bad. He meant parents blood. But he heard that. He said, parrots blood. He said, right, I'll do that. Leave it with me. I can see where this is going. He goes, goes to a pet shop. He says, give us like half a dozen parrots. Sure. Text around to the kid's house, takes the blood from the parrots, puts it into the kid. Kid's fine. The kids, fine. It worked. Such a load of shite. In my life. I've never heard such twaddle, such just made up, enhanced, exaggerated in my load of old rubbish. When he told me this, he said, the doctor said, what do I do? And the doctor said, give him some blood. And the doctor went, where do I get blood from? So. Parents blood. Give him some parents blood. Give him some parents and some parents blood. Yeah. I just need to know where you stitched you up. You know what he said? He said, so do you believe that? I went, tell it to Steve. He went, do you believe it? I went, tell it to Steve. Carl, where did you read that? That was on the Internet. Because of. Your geller last night, eating all that funny food and that. And also, they all got a bit scared last night, didn't they? With a. With a snake. I didn't see that. Is this. Yeah. Yeah. I got all worried about a snake getting on the sort of wandering about in between the sleeping bags and stuff. Yeah. And they were all scared and it. Leave it with me. Sorry? The doctor says, leave it with me. Well, they were all scared because there's a snake and it's so easy to find stuff out before the. Before they. Where are they? Where is this jungle? Before they went. Give it half an hour on the Internet. I found out, with snakes, you don't need to worry. Right. They're deaf. They haven't got any ears. Right. So as long as you. You're really quiet, they'll probably leave you alone. Yeah. And also they don't have eyelids. So they were suggesting if one's coming towards you, just like kick sand in its eyes, it can't blink and it leaves a bit, like, annoyed and it wanders off. But they didn't do any research before they went. Yeah. I think your knowledge would hold you in good stead. I don't think you need to know any more than you know. Well, we're going to come back to that because he also explained to me where a saying comes from that I want to you to be part of, but. Oh, and also we should mention as well, Carl, you've come up with a competition. Is this right? Brilliant competition. He thinks this can go to television. Is this an idea you've come up with? Yeah, Carl, I'm so looking forward to it. I mean, I'm, I'm looking forward to it. I'm continuing our exposure of myths and legends, of artful tale. We expose that myth that some maybe older rockers have had it and they've gotten that they were never any good. And the kids today, people like Rod Stewart. Rod Stewart, he's a great artist. He's a slightly laughable man, but a great artist. Let's go back to when it was. When he was rocking, when he cut the mustard. Yeah. Rod Stewart. You wear it well. XFM 104.9. Yeah. This doctor, I mean, we should find out who he is really, and if he's still practicing, because it, it worries me a little bit that, you know, he did that also. I mean, he thinks he's got away with it, but how could he be sure those parrots wouldn't talk? True, true. I mean, there are six of them. They probably got together and they probably put it on the Internet. I mean, I feel that story, Carl, it asks more questions than it answers. Really? Like most of your stories. Yeah, that's the problem. I always. For them, I always feel like I need a little bit more information, like. Yeah. Did the parrot boy continue to live? Yeah. You know, to a ripe old age or did he die weeks later after this charlatan doctor who was going around, you know, spurious and did he break. His nose trying to crack a big nut? No, I think he was all right. He lived to a. See, I'd have shouted. If I was that doctor, I'd have shouted that down the phone. Are you sure you said parrot's blood? Yeah. You sure it was parrot's blood? Listen, I mean, you know, I'm not the best doctor in the world, but. Did you say parrot's blood? Yeah, but what you're forgetting is you're going back to the time where, like, they used leeches to do, like. No, we're not. We're going back to the late seventies. If there's a phone call to America direct. Come on, Carl. They weren't calling America like in the medieval times or in the victorian age. Come on, think about it, Carl. You know, this has got to be like the, like, you know, thirties or forties, the earliest. You know, I'm intrigued to know where this. I think there's someone on the. On the web who's just putting information on there to lead you astray. Yeah. I think because you're the only person who finds this stuff. Other people are using this to write. Looking at that, then what we. Well, you know, I always look at weird stuff. What were you looking for? But what do you type in the search engine to find stories? What were you looking for? Was this woman with a weird head? Why were you looking for that? What were you doing? I did about it. I did, like, someone talking about on another station, right. About this woman with a. With a funny head. I love the fact you're intrigued with these things. You go in the basement of Waterstones or Dillon's or somewhere and there's these. These medical books that you're loving. This is free on the Internet in it. It's all there. Yeah. So what you typed in? Weird head, woman or. Lady with head? Yeah, weird, weird. Weird people or something I put in. Sure. Yeah. Did you come up? 7000 hits, Carl Dunkington. But it's all there, isn't it? It's interesting. The one that I was telling you before about. What's the name? The lost letter. The lost letter, lost postcard. That's just turned up. Some woman sent a postcard years and years ago to a niece or something. Right. And a niece was like three years old back then. And just now, I think, like yesterday or the day before, it turned up. The postcard turned up 74 years late, 74 years later. Took. 74 year old girl's been living in the same house that whole time. There's always a question you can ask to just scratch the credibility of these stories. There's always. It's like the apocryphal tower. Was this the slugs? Was this those slugs from last week? Yeah. Were they holding back because they're slow, because the postman slug is useless. His round takes him 74 years, then he's got to go back to the beginning. He's got 74 and they can't carry the bag. That's. They go. That's what they turn to glue. That's why they turn to glue. Oh, it's pitiful it is pitiful. So you don't believe that someone sent a postcard years ago and somehow it's been stuck in the bottom of a post bag or something and it's only. Just stuck in the bottom of a post bag. That means that there's like, a 95 year old postman who's still wandering around. Did you, did you have to pay, like, the difference on the charges? Because presumably it wouldn't have had Queen Elizabeth. It was a penny black, presumably, was it? Yeah. What would be on the stamp? It would have been invalid. Surely. It'S the postman's fault. The post office can't. It was only three at the time. Himself wasn't. He was deep. He is dead. Yeah. He'll be well and truly dead now. Yeah, but the fact is that the post office made an error. Right? They lost this letter. He's only just turned up. They can't turn around and say, sorry about this. I hope it isn't urgent. It's turned up 74 years late. And by the way, you owe us 25 pence. Yeah, yeah. They wouldn't do that. Wouldn't you? Yeah, that's true. That's true. You're asking questions, AC. That's. That's true. You see? So, um, you're interested in that, where science come from as well, aren't you? Because you. You told me one of the week. What? That. I don't know if Steve's aware of that. Do you want to tell Steve this one? What's this? The same way. Do this quiz. We'll do the quiz later. I know you're excited about the quiz. Let's do that later. But what's this saying? Right? What is the saying? Chucking a baby out with the bath water? Yeah. Have you heard that phrase, don't throw. The baby out with the bath water? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. How would you use that? Well, how would I use that? Don't throw the baby up with the bathwater. I suppose if you've. Maybe you've been discussing something, you've come up with some plans, but you're slightly worried and, you know, you might abandon the whole plan, whereas there might be some ideas in there which are still worth protecting. So you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There might be something you can just change and you don't. Yeah. There might be a few ideas you can salvage from an otherwise worthless one. Well, the saying, right, comes from, like, years ago again, and pray or post. Phone. Ages and ages ago when, like, you know, the bloke worked in the house, you know, he was like, the coal man. And then you have, like. It's important then, like, the mam is like, you know, she stays at home making the dinner, looking after the kids. Yep. And you've got, like, a little kid who's just growing up, just messing about and stuff. So what happens is, back then, they didn't have, like, fresh, flowing, warm water every day, so all they could do, they could only afford to have, like, one full big bath of fresh water. So they fill up the bath, right? And then the dad would come home and he said, oh, I've had. All right, you know, that tough day at work and that down the pit. And his wife would say, it's all right, I'm putting the dinner on. You gonna have a nice warm bath. Because he gets the bath first. He gets the bath first because he's. The grafter and he's covered in coal. It's covered in coal. So the water's, like, minging by the time he's finished. Yeah, right. And then the wife says, oh, after all my cleaning the house and doing the cooking, I'm a bit sweating out. She's covered in dust and grime. I'll have a bath. Right at the end of the line, there's a little baby. It's been playing out all day. Also got, like, little. Little grubby knees and stuff. Needs to have a bath. Yeah. It goes in the bath, right. But because the water is so dirty, sure. They go and empty the water out of the window. Can't see the baby in it. Chucking the baby out with the bath water. So it comes from. What do you think, Steve? Steve? So, so, firstly, that. That sort of. I mean, that doesn't explain. You start. You're struggling, aren't you? You're struggling where to start first. I can't see how. We've now applied this to this for. Days, Steve, waiting for you to hear this one. These coal mining parents. Negligent. Yeah. I learned. That'S the way around to do it. The one covered in coal. Yeah. You go first. You go first. Don't wash the baby and then get in that. Yeah. One covered in cold goes first. That's the best idea. Yeah. Second most dirty one go second. And then the clean little baby. I think. I think we should do him last. But he's done nothing towards this family. But more than that, Rick, leave him to his own devices. Yeah, Jack, I'm just gonna throw the water out. Yeah. In the bath. Don't check. Have you checked that? The baby's doing that? No, I'm not even gonna waste my time. You check in, you'd see. I'd be able to see a baby. The baby was in here. I'd be able to see it. I'm just gonna throw it out. Yeah, I'm not even gonna look, to be honest, Jack, if the baby's in there, then it should be making sound. Jack, we have lost three children this way. Don't worry. Where did you read that? Vines. There, Steve. On XFM 104.91. Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl's getting very excited, as we all are, about his new. Should we. Should we let him do a little taster for us? Well, I'm very excited about it. I mean, so the gist of it, what is it? What is it exactly? Is it a game show or is it a competition? It's just. Just something that, you know, you can play. And also people at home can set part in it. Now would they phone in about this or they can just play at home while they're listening? They can just play at home. Okay. You mean we haven't got any prizes? No, there isn't. No. I think we could get a phone in, maybe. Well, I don't know. Let's hear the game idea first. Right. It's music related. Okay, good. And what I do is I sort of tell a little story. Okay. And that story makes up a song title. All right, well, it sounds ambitious. So is it a cryptic clue? Could be. Say like this, right? Oh, dearie me. Oh, dearie me. Say like this. This woman, right, she's pregnant. You know the answer to this one, so don't be saying anything. This is just aimed at Steve. Okay? Right? This woman has a baby. Yeah. She's pregnant, has a baby. And the doctors there in the, in the hospital going, oh, yeah, you've got a lovely little baby. You told me that. This is so this guy. A lovely little baby. It's just coming out now. You'll be able to see in a minute. And it's like covered in gunk and stuff. Yeah. And he's going, yeah, it's nearly as coming out. I see. See, it's a little head in that and he gets hold of it and it's full of all this gunk. Right? The baby's full of gunk. Yeah. Like the covered in gunk or full of gunk? Covered in it. Right. And he goes, here you go, get all your baby. And he drops it, right. What songs that there's so much irrelevance there, Steve. I can't tell. It's not a cryptic clue. It's not a cryptic clue because only, I mean, the gist of it isn't the best one. That's right. I mean, there is just, there's, there's things there that you were dwelling on and thinking of pun. Don't just go for gut instinct. What was it? What was that? I just need to try and get the basics of this as a woman. She's pregnant. She has a baby. Yeah. The baby's covered in gunk. Right. And because of the gunk, the doctor drops the baby. Yeah. That's all I need to know. Yeah. That is all you need to know. Yeah. The pregnancy is largely irrelevant. Okay. What are the key elements? The birth and the doctor dropping it. That. The irrelevant and the dropping of the. I've absolutely no idea. I can't even begin to think about what's happened. She's had a baby. The doctors try to deliver it. He's saying it's a nice little baby you've got. This is all irrelevant. This is all irrelevant. Right. Let me tell you this. So, so just to be fair, to see, so he gets, he can get into your mind. Right. This is not a traditional cryptic clue. Logical problem. This is, this is. Carl, what song am I thinking of? That is underworld born slippy. I have to say, actually, that makes textbook sense. Yeah. No. Do you like all the story about. You can see it in a minute. Oh, it's just covered in gunk. Yeah, I agree. There is some extraneous detail. Yeah, the born was good because it was. That's what, that's all good. Born was good. Yeah. And born sleepy. I know. I actually, I was quite impressed by that car, I have to say. No, to be fair to you. I'm not just patronizing you. Oh, well, I've got, I actually, that was really good. And I disrespect Ricky Gervais for standing. Well, let's go ahead with it then. I feel we could, we could maybe open this up to email correspondence or then, okay. This is Carl Pilkington's new game show idea. It's what? It's just once. The song. Carl Pilkington presents. What's the song? Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Mister Carl Pilkington. Okay, let's play a record. Let's, let's come back after. Give out the number ready for him. Well, you should make a note of this. You can email us. The email's up and running Ricky gervaisfm dot co dot Uk. Ricky dot gervaisfm dot co dot Uk. What's the phone number, Carl? It's 0870-0800-1234-0870-08 hundred 1234. Make a note of that and we'll, we'll have a game of what song is Carl thinking of after this next track. What do you want to play? What? Oh, continuing again, old fogies who were good once and I won't hear a thing said against the new kids out there. It's not all new metal. Is it true? This is Cat Stevens, a little known album, Mona Bone Jack on. And this one's called trouble. It's a lovely song. Cat Stevens, trouble from Mona Bone jack on XFM won a 4.9. Playing some new songs, playing some old songs, an old game, some chitchat, some tears, some laughter. And Carl Pilkington with his brand new show. What's the song? What song am I thinking now? I'm, I mean, you're nervous about this, aren't you, Rick? I am. You're worried. Well, because I've heard some of these clues before. Ramblings. There's sometimes they're close to ramblings of a fool, right. And it really is like those. What am I thinking? Yeah. I don't know, though. I actually was genuinely impressed by born sleepy. I have to give him the best. One of the better ones because I, because I was short, sweet and it worked. Some of these that you say, they're not gonna be quite as pissed. Some of them are like Emily Bronte novels. Haha. Now listen, we're just gonna go for it. Then you do it and we just get people to call up. Because I want, I want to see the general public's confusion trying to work out. Why don't you give us your next clue and then we'll play a track and then we'll hopefully have people on the line after the track to try and answer it. And you can recap briefly. So give us your clue now for what song am I thinking of? Right, this one. It's about a woman and she's just normal. Nothing wrong with her. So she thinks, right? But there's the twist is this like the towers, the unexpected? And she's got like, you know, she's got a mate and she's having a normal life, having a good time on that. And then this thing happens, right? And she starts to stink and she can't have a bath, right? And she really wants to have a bath. She's dead. Sweaty and stuff. She tried. She's going about her daily stuff. She can do everything else normal. She can eat, she can talk, everything. But for some reason, she can't have a bath. Is there a coal mining husband in the bath? Yeah. Is this born stinky? She can't have a bath. So a woman can't have a bath? Yeah. Or a shower? She can. Okay, leave it there, Rick. Don't try and guess. It's to get the general public can phone up and ask questions. So I just. Just go for it? I think so. I thought we don't want just people just phone this. Why don't. They can ask one question. Yeah, they can ask one question of car, then they have to make a guess. Okay. Oh, 8700, 801. Let's go for one. This is edge. Edgy radio. Let in. Pause. Hello, XFM. Hello, I'm ringing about. What's the song? Absolutely. What do you think? Well, I'm going for Dirty Diana. Dirty Diana. See, that works a great guess. It does, yeah, but it doesn't work because why can't she have a bath? Okay, so the answer is gonna ask you. Well, that's your one question. That be the answer? That would be the answer, I'm afraid. What was your name? Shelly. Shelly. Thanks very much, Shelley. I should tell you that, you know, that you should never take this personally, because no one can really get into the mind of Carl. So don't. Don't, you know, beat yourself up about this. I don't expect anyone to get these clues. So. So well done. That is a fine guess. Thank you. Okay, anyone else think. Hello, XFM. Who's that on the line? It's Chris. Hello, Chris. A question for Carl. Before you give this. I haven't thought of a really good question or anything yet. You just want to go for the guess. Well, no, what I thought was, I'm. Sure Simon Mayo used to do this when he did the breakfast show in radio one year ago. No, he didn't. So you just pinched this idea? Karl, if you're gonna rip someone off. Kyle, do not rip off Simon Mayo. I haven't ripped this off. I thought this was a new idea. I was gonna do it with sound effects instead, but that's. Yeah, he used to do that, and. He used to get his team to play other characters. You idiot. Well, no, hang on. Not you. Not you, Chris. I'm saying, you idiot to Carl. Yeah, but nothing's new anyway, is it? So I'm not getting annoyed about it. What do you think the answer is? Is it cornflake girl by Tori Amos. Good answer. She can have a bath because she'd go all. Soggy. So. No, it's not. But that's a great answer. It could have been. You're already seeing the error of this great radio. I know you hooked on this. I genuinely excited. This is really, like that. Those so called lateral thinkers that a man got into a field and dies. Why? He ran out of air. No, not the one. I'm thinking. Simon Mayo, like Sue you or something for doing it. Will you stop? Don't mention that. Yeah. Listen, I think if you're going to steal ideas from someone, it should be a brain box like Mayo. I mean, he's the man. The only example of one I can never remember here on this show, because I was quite young then, was, um. Some people were pretending to, like, tap someone's phone or something and then they got caught and the answer was just bugging by whistle because they were genius. That was absolute genius. That's absolute genius. That's the sort of standard you've got to come up against. Thanks very much, Chris. The phone lines are hot. Hi. Is it candy perfume girl? Is it what? Candy perfume girl. Candy perfume girl? Yeah. Candy perfume girl. Is it? Well, who's that by? Madonna. No, it's. That sounds like an obscure album track. She stinks and everything. She's a normal life. She's. I didn't say she was a sweet or anything, but for some reason she can't have a bath. Or is this a big song just to give him a clue? It's a bigger song than candy sweet girl. Thank you very much indeed for your guessing. Thank you. Cheers. Sorry, you know. Okay, one more, then we're going to a record. Come on. Okay, yeah. Is it high and dry by Radiohead? High and. High and dry. Now that's great. She smells, which is another word for high. She's dry because she doesn't have a shower. Carl, if it isn't that, yours will never be as good as that. He's the winner. Whatever you're thinking of, that clue is brilliant. What's your name, mate? It's Richard. Richard. I mean, you can't beat that. That's a bit too lateral. Don't be stupid. It's perfect. He's made yours into a clever clue. He's made high. She smells dry. She never gets in the bath or shower. It's not that, is it, Carl? You don't even get that, do you? Not really. Have you ever heard of the word high being used to mean so smelly. No. No. Oh, that was where you went wrong there, mate. Richard. Well, I'm declaring you the winner, even though that isn't the only. Let's play a song and let's play. Give it one more chance, because. Yeah, if people think about it, it. Is really easy, though, because I've got to go out. Okay, we'll do it very quickly. Stay in for ten minutes. We're just going to play a new. Okay, let's try to cold play them. Out with this. Coldplay one I love. That's for Nick, Neil. Olivia in Tower Bridge. Absolutely. And also Nikki from Bromley, who emailed in. She's enjoying the show and she. She wanted a bit coldplay. That's the b side of the current single. This is a great show, isn't it? We've got great music, we got laughs, tears, we've got requests, we've got Simon Mayo games. It's just. It's just like radio one for less people. Radio one for less people. This is great. So, listen, Kai, you were so excited about this game, weren't you, earlier? You can't. You came in with a leap in your step. Although I must say, the phones are going mental. We're gonna have to take some more people. High and dry is great. I mean, it works. Can we have a very quick. Can you make it. Can you make it so high and dry doesn't work. Now, give us a bit of information that makes it different to high and. Dry or Carl describes, in a roundabout way, a story which somehow is representative of a song. Is that song title? Okay, so this woman, she's all right, you know, she has a normal life. Pretty much. Kind of. Yeah. There's probably a few things, actually, that she can't do, thinking about it. But the main problem would be having a wash or having a bath or having a shower. Yeah. Maybe going for a swim. Thinking about it. Right. I think water is the clue, isn't it? That's the clue. Hi there. It's Mark. Hello, Mark. Hi, Mark. No, it's not. That's a great guess. Smells like teen spirit again. He's also brilliant. Thank you, Mark. Well done. No, it's not that. All right. Aloe XFM. Oh, that's. That's a dodgy mobile. That's a bit of a clue. Oh, they've just given up. They've all been going for smells like teen spirit. They just hung up. Hello, XFM. Hi. Is it. She's electric. Excellent. She's electric. It makes sense. That's fantastic. She's electric. Why does she smell? Because she doesn't have a bath on that. Because you can't have a bath or a shower. What's. What's your name? Neil. Neil. So, Neil. Got it. So did you get it straight away? No. During the song. A process of elimination from all the other wrong answers. Yeah, basically. So she's electric. Rick, I have to say, you. You're holding your head in hand in your hands and it looks like you want to shoot off, but I have to say, I thought that was quite good. I genuinely thought that was quite good. It's not a cryptic clue, is it, because. No, she smells. There's a few things you can't do. She's electric. Yeah, but do you understand what. What I'm getting at? She's electric. I always understand what you're getting out, Carl. That's never been a problem in this, the years I've known you. Got it? Yeah. I have to say, I think you're down on this idea. I could definitely see that. ITV one replacing get liberty. Get me out of here. Carl Pilkington hosting Simon Mayo on the phone to the lawyers. Well, Neil, there's no prizes or anything, but well done. Well done. That was well worth it. Right, well, you go away with the awards in the knowledge that you've beaten Carl. Yeah. You can secure the knowledge that you thought how Carl does. Absolutely. Well done, Neil. I have to say, I think you're being harsh on him. I think. Ok, that's a great. All right, let's do it again next week. I thought that was a great game. Brilliant play record. What do you want to play? Oh, you know, I tell you, we've been playing some oldies, Rick, and I've enjoyed them all, but I think I've been in love with this song for many, many years. And when I saw it, reminded of it in con air, the film con air, remember, they stick it on in con air and it's just dynamites Lynn and Skynyrd. I love this. Sweet home Alabama player. Turn this up, turn up strange and beautiful. Aqua lung, or as Carl says, aqua lung on XFM 104.9. Well, it seems that Carl's clue, you know, did go down quite well. Some other people got it. The game show as a whole has been well received. Well, I have to say, the. The email, you know, we've had. We've had loads of emails, Rick. You know, I mean, we've had just count two. Yeah. And one of them was aimed at Simon Mayo. They thought they were listening to Mayo. Yeah. And the other is saying, carl, they. Love the game show radio one with less people. Yeah. Yeah. And so, despite the fact was a stolen idea, I think we can do it again next week. Let's wrestle up some prizes as well. You're just like your little magpie, aren't you? Thieving shiny ideas for Mayo's nest. Absolutely. We played Lydia Skinner just before the ads and I was just looking at the compilation it comes from. It's great combination. We took this from driving rock. Yeah. Which I imagine is not available in the shop. I imagine it's come straight from the personal collection of maybe Taran or Foxy or Canfield. But there's some great names on here that I'd like to see. Maybe we could play little Vance. Any tiny van. You know, you're a little mayo. Canfield's a little vanilla. I mean, these are some names just gone. I haven't heard them for a long time. Again. Alana Miles. No rubbish, Ria, you don't hear. Yeah, well, what one? Spin doctors. Oh, lest we forget the spin doctors. Crash test dummies. What happened to them to know who else we got on here? Richard Marks. Yeah. Mister big. I didn't. He's guilty in that song when he goes, I swear I did and all that. And the police came around. Well, there's no smoke without fire. Reckon he did it? I reckon he meant murdered her. You're absolutely right. Go on. Legs zz Tom. She knows how to use them. She doesn't know how to. It's what it is. Let's impulse from the brain. Yeah. How is she using them? She's just. She's just. You know. The brothers do beer on here as well. Oh, isn't that. There's nothing wrong with that. Absolutely. No, it's starship and Toto as well. It's not actually. What is it? Can you name another toto track? Hold the line. Just hold the line. Let's rock. Put the. Let's down. Is it good stuff when session musicians get together? Can we hear a quick little blaster play a little bit? Hold the line. That should be track. That's probably track ten. I hope this doesn't annoy too many people. We're worried. Yeah. We like to give our radio slick. Is this it? This is not it. Yeah. Giving us his best air guitar. That was dynamite. That was great. We'd have some. I think we should have, like a classic rock anthem every week. Oh, do you not think I would like to. I'd like to bit a rainbow. Maybe next week. Who knows? Phone in if you want to hear. Some classic rock, classic rock indeed. We've ripped off mayo. Let's do that. Absolutely. Let's just steal ideas from other better dj's. Okay? There's some great ideas out there, I'm sure. I mean, if you want to like any fix, it's done. If you may want to eat your packed lunch on a roller coaster. Yeah. With some Boy scouts. Or dance with banana armor. Yeah. Then we're. Or five star. I love the fact five star reform. There's three of them. Have you heard about this? No. Sound left. Up the street, white stripes on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl pilking. Well, I had a good time. I've enjoyed it. Yeah, it's been nice, fun. Some good tracks and some laughs. A new competition by Simon Mayo. Absolutely. That was great. Yeah. Yeah. Carl, have you heard the big news that Ricky Gervais is looking to take up? Well, you explain it to me because I know. What are you talking. What do you mean you're taking up boxing? Is this right? No. What is the story? You want to be fighting for money? No. Yeah, bare knuckle fight. What is it? No, all it is, I've been watching this, um, show on cable called Born to fight, and it's also late. I think it's, uh, on the after roadies, which is like. Yeah, it's a bloke, one bloke with the cameras who goes on tour with different people. Like, he went with motorhead. He went with a meatloaf tribute act. He went on with coldplay, was in one of them. It's that, it's the same called born to fight. And they just take a different story. It might be an amateur fight or it might be an unlicensed fight, not illegal. Or it might be white collar, which I'm thinking of doing. What's. What's white collar? White collar is just people who want to fight. And it's organized. Yes, but it's charity. It's safe. It's a charity. Do you have big events? And it's just two people that, you know, aren't boxers, aren't ammo boxers, and they get in the ring and do three, three two minute rounds and they just lay into each other. Got head guards on. And I don't mean to alarm you, but, you know, we work together, obviously, and we make the office and stuff. Your face is my fortune. I can't have that worry for you. It is. I'm not gonna say. Well, your heart as well, is also a concern. Yeah. You know, and you're eating and stuff. You go, no, gervaise, you're only funny because you're fat. No, I agree. This is true, but I'm saying there's a degree, there's a difference between being fit. Yeah. And I would say, for instance, don't eat kind of, you know, cheese and bacon, you know, on their own all day for breakfast. So what I'm saying is there's a difference between, you know, exercising and then having your face beating in. And what I'm saying is that you. It. I just don't think it's a good idea. I might win. No, the problem I don't. That's irrelevant. You're still gonna get. Take a couple of blows to the face. And the point is this, Rick, you're not gonna win. No, because you are delusional. You think that you are probably the world's greatest boxer. I know, ever since I've known you. You seem to think that it's the case because you've watched all the rocky films and you think that's fair enough, that seems straightforward enough, but look at your physique, you know? Yeah, you've got some upper body strength, but, you know, you've also got some up some lower belly strength as well, I noticed. And my concern is you're going to go in there and you're not only going to be a broken man when you realize that you're just not as handy in the ring as you thought you were. Both are going to. You're going to incur some interest. This is fighting talk. This is fighting talk. This man, this one's going to do. It more now just because of you. It was the same when Adrian didn't agree that rocky could beat clever Lang. Yeah, she made that mistake then. She made the same mistake with Draco. At what age? She turned up at the end to take a bit of the credit, didn't she? This kind of thin, nimble youth in your makeup and your eyeliner. All the rest of it, you. I bet you had no idea, you had no thoughts about boxing. It never came into your mind, did it? So at what age did you suddenly think, wait a minute, I've taken the wrong path in life. I could have eaten the world heavyweight. I don't think I could. When have you suddenly decided that you can, you can suddenly be a bit street tough? I don't understand why this has suddenly come about in. Well, I'm not pulling out a shout, am I, to fight people it's not. I've not. It's not like. No, but you've got to find Robbie, William. But you've got to find someone else presumably to fight with. Yeah, but it'd probably be a businessman who wants to fight. Right. You know, there's something really weird about that, don't you think? That sound. If you just listen to yourself, I want to fight another bit. I want to fight a businessman. Please, may I fight a businessman? I want to fight someone who wants to, you know. I want to fight them, though. I want to fight somebody. It sounds a bit mad. Bring them on. I want to fight people. No, but it's more that. It's more the effort and the training, the commitment to it. Like climbing a mountain. I mean, I think climbing a mountain and doing a marathon is ridiculously macho. It's not the fact that you can. No, that's not macho compared with macho. Isn't it? Climbing. There's no reason to climb a mountain. There's no reason to do a marathon. If you can run a mile. That's all you need. The fact that you train is whether you can do it yourself and achieve something. And this is more like the training and the learning skill and then seeing if it works. I don't want to get in there. But aren't you concerned about. You might get beaten or you might get beaten up? I should say. No. What's the worst that can happen? You get black eyes, bruises and bruises. Jamaica, let me just remind you of the time we were working in your flat, and you immediately, I think. I don't know to this day what happened, but you started choking. You clasped your chest. You were breathing, wheezing. I leapt over to you. I remember screaming. I don't know the Heimlich maneuver. If you swallowed something, I can't help. You gained your breath. You gained your composure. I said, what happened? Did you eat something? Did you go down the wrong way? You said, no, I swallowed some dust. I swallowed some dust. You breathed some dust in. That was in the air. There was some dust in the air. You breathe that in. It knocked you out for two days. You're in bed for two days. I love that. I don't think you. I don't think you. And that's some dust. What do you think this businessman's gonna do? Hoi ja poimanent. Yeah. It hurt you, Poimon. Do you find a lump? Didn't you, on your testicle once? We sat in a doctor's waiting room. I remember for about 40 I checked. Out, it was fine. I think I went twice, didn't I? Yeah. I said to the doctor at one. Point, I said, did you check round the back? Yeah. I was thinking he hadn't checked it. Yeah. Just because I hadn't found anything. My point is this. Yes. Something of I, you know, something of a hypochondriac. You know that already. So why do you think this is going to be any different? Wow. If you take it, when you take the first blow to the head, you take the punch, you'll immediately think that you've got some kind of, you know, brain disorder. No, I've always wanted to. I just wanted to make sure. I wanted to know that I definitely lost my looks, right? And I've seen some of the publicity shots. I've got mirrors and mouse. So now, because I've definitely lost my looks now I've got nothing to lose. So I want, you know, maybe a younger, more handsome man. I want to teach him. Yes. Let me just. I'll end with this. Right? For people who listen to this show regularly. Yeah. You already sound like you're punch drunk, all right? And that's just your natural way of talking. Please, let's not do the real thing. Oh. Play a record. Oh. I mean, is it gonna be televised? Well, we could get it on DVD, maybe release it. I'm interested. Okay. Is there money to be made? Yeah, that's the money. Well, maybe we should talk about it. Okay. On XFM 104.9, you join us now. Live at ship, the old people's home, where tv star Ricky Gervais is taking on his first non professional bout. Ricky, who are you fighting this evening? Pete's medley. Okay, Pete's medley. How old is Pete? He's 72. 72 years old? Yeah. And you're very excited about the fight. I know. Pete's just recovered from a massive coronary, hasn't he? Well, I don't want to get into that. He's deemed himself fit and that's good enough for me. If he. If he wants to fight, listen, right. Someone just called up and said they're fight me. He sounds pretty, pretty tasty. I said, oh, how tall? He says five foot eleven. I said, what do you weighs, a 13 stone? Said, older, 27. I explained to him, I'm looking for someone a lot older and smaller and smaller. Donna Stella, stel from this. Just a sport, you know. Oh, don't go into badminton. The shuttlecock can hurt your eye. That's just a sport. Okay, fair enough, I'm sure. Resume this conversation next week. Of course, we'll also be playing more of Carl's new brilliant game with prizes, hopefully. Yeah. Yeah. Simon Mayo's. What is Carl thinking? Absolutely. I'll leave you with a song for the ladies. Rick, if I may. This is by my friend Harry. You may know he sends me tracks every so often that I should listen to. And this is a particular favorite of mine. Pretty pleased. It's by Kevin Tehista's red terror. I don't know if I've pronounced that right, but enjoy that and we'll see you next week. Let's get ready to rumble.",
