  "text": "The bitter end. That's the first single to be lifted from their forthcoming album sleeping with ghosts, which you can hear in full on the XFM online listening posts. I'm Ricky, your cheeky little devil. Gervais with me, Steve. All right, ladies, what can I get you to drink? What I think I made of money. I meant half a mile to some up merchant and Carl. Oh, I'm stressed. I'm stressed. If it's too hard, I don't want to do it. Pilkington. Indeed. Oh well, it's nice to be back. Rick. Rick, I heard a rumor that you weren't gonna be playing great music today. I'm assuming that's wrong. It is wrong. This is what I mean about the grapevine and chinese whispers. I'm not having it. There's some great music coming up. Right. I heard that there was gonna be some boring chat. Sorry. Well, I want. I want names. But that's the gospel. Totally wrong. It was going to be inane, ill thought out, often stupid. No, Carl's not going to talk so much this week. We're going to try and sort of bring, you know, bring it back to real radio. So that's an absolute lie. Yeah. Yeah. Great, great great. Yeah, not bad. Have you going oddly now, aren't you? Well, I will be doing later. Tell you about that later on. What? Um, there's a hook. Can I just check? Because there are rules in place, aren't there? Yeah, there was a big. There was a big bus stop in the week. Wind him up. I'm not allowed to wind him up socially now. I'm not allowed to. What am I not allowed to do socially? I think squeezing the head socially. Yes. It's been crossed off. Right, okay. I agreed to that because it got to a head where, you know, Carl was really upset and he was thinking of just giving it. Giving it all in, weren't you? Yeah. Yeah. Why was that? Because he was just winding me up too much. Yeah. I mean, do you want to bring it all up again? I don't mind. What was I doing? It was just, I mean, I should. Say now that there was a conversation where it was all. We were all sort of really walking on eggshells. It was, it was frosty. It was a conference call and Carl was on one end. And I'll tell you, it was. I was very much a media. I was very much a Un mediator. It was difficult to sort of keep it serious when I'm saying stuff like, I'm sick of you putting a Burger King bag on me head. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. There's a part of me that's like, I can't believe we're doing this. What I like about it is that I'm laughing and going, well, I won't do that anymore. And he's going, you can still do it on air. And like today I was gonna. I came in, I went to squeeze z. He went at 01:00 I love those rules. Yeah, I love those rules of one. And three on a Saturday. Last week as well. Really? Because I got in a bit earlier to do an edit for you on some track that had swearing in it. Right. So getting early. He comes in, first thing he does is go to sort of squeeze my head. And my reaction was, not now, do it later. As if it's all right to do it later. So that's kind of what made me think, this isn't normal, isn't it? We should just point out, when we say squeezing your head, what exactly does that mean? I put my hand on the front, I do two experiments, right? One is the side, because you can crush an egg sideways. So I think that's more dangerous. And I squeeze. I actually put my elbows out and I press like a vise and I really go for it until it really hurts. And the front one is, it shouldn't hurt so much if I'm. If my experiment's right. I don't know. Well, it was all this, that sort of, you know, built up. Sure. And the research that you're doing there, Rick, is that going to be available online at some point? Well, that was the problem. That's what I was saying to him. Because it kind of started last week. Well, it's been going on since we've known you. I just upped it. I just upped it last week. I think it got to add on them Thursday when I filmed it. Yeah, that's right. I brought in the cameraman to film me torturing him. And there were some people from the 6th floor being shown round. Yeah. Some management and that showing. Probably clients around, you know, sort of. They've probably been on all the different floors. Same with all the different radio. Fox, this. This is XFM, the sort of ulta, this sort of noise going on. Yeah. You see them all look down. I'm saying, don't do that. Right. Sure. They might want to spend a load of money. Yeah. And he's doing that. He's wrestling with me, he's filming it. So that's when I just thought, you know, and then when we were having the argument on the phone. I was saying, you know, has this been some sort of experiment? Yeah, he did. He said that and of course I lost it. But it's all. It's all good now. Do you want to squeeze his head before we play the next game? I won't at the moment because, I mean, we've got to get on. It's not. It's not right. And that annoyed me as well because I was trying to find out where he was going. I was filming him. I was going on waiting for Carl. Told Johnny he's meeting a mate at six, which annoys me on two counts. I'm just doing the camera, you know, so I'm gonna. I'm gonna follow him and just turn up and go, all right, where you been? But then when I came and he went, I'm meeting a mate. And he told me where it was. So I told him, that spoils my fun. Of course you'd want. Yeah, I don't want him to like it, which is sort. It's sort of taken. Pulled the rug under my carpet. Now that he's gonna let me, do you know what I mean? It's just. It's a little bit annoying. It's that thing, though. You see, this happened years ago to me, right. When, you know, you get pally with someone and then you wind each other up and then there comes a time when you just go over the line. Yeah, right. What happened? Well, it was this lad called Anthony, right. It was me mate. Yeah. And we used to sort of always have a little fight in the toilet and that punch each other. I want to wipe it. And then the punches, you know, used to get harder. Yeah, stuff. And then, you know, so he hit me harder. Turned out into a proper fight. Yeah. I chipped his tooth on the sink. Right, right. This happened at school and it was time for assembly and I thought, oh, and he's in the toilet crying, go to assembly. There's police in there in the assembly that day telling people about unnecessary violence. And you thought they were there for you. So I'm like, oh, no, Anthony's gonna come in in a minute. Like, crying with all blood coming from his mouth. I'm gonna get arrested. Yeah. Yeah. Did you go running asleep? That was an example. Yeah. I mean, it kind of happened because I went out with a girl who we fancied. How old are we now? About eight or nine, I think. That's out of order, going out with a mate's girl. Yeah. But she didn't like him. He had like, big ears and that. He had no chance. No, but do you know what I mean? All right, I haven't got the looks like I used to. Sure, when you were eight, but that's. Before the stress of, you know, having ed, squos and that sort of thing. I have aged a lot. I love your own grammar. That's the past tense, is it? Squeeze or to have squeezed. Oh, he did squoze his head, yeah. Oh, brilliant. So, you know, what about it? About me? Be my wife, Carl, I'm asking you. I think we can squeeze that in. Be my wife, Carl. Come on. Will you miss me on holiday? No. Really? No. What? He's joking, I assume, Steve. Well, I don't know. Can you tell? I can't tell whether he's serious or not. What do you mean? No, no, definitely not. I mean, I might. When I get back, I'll go have a quick chat, but I'm not going to be sat there going, oh, I wish I was back in London for Ricky to, you know, we've sorted the ad problem out. Yeah. No, still won't. No. Okay, let's do what I'm saying. I was with Carl in the week, I think it was Tuesday or Wednesday. And was it last week? There was a program on about the child who was older than her mum. A child that was older than her mum, yeah. Right. Which was. He was looking forward to as much as Oliver. The. The humanzi. Humanzi, yeah, yeah. And I didn't see it in the end. Did you miss it as well? And what it is is this a little girl and she's got an aging thing. So she was telling me about this, it's all from him. He went, well, it is, right, she's about five, right. But she's aged, so she's actually 90. Right. And I went, oh, God, really? Went. Yeah. And then he went, could she get served in an off license? I went, no. He went, well, that's not fair. What do you mean? He went, well, I said, she's five years old. She's a five year old girl. Yeah, but she's got the body of a 90 year old, so. Oh, God, let her have a fag. Wouldn't you let her have one? Is she. If she asked, yeah, if you worked. In an off license and she wandered in. Right. And so she's two foot six. Well, I don't know, because I haven't seen it. I don't know that much about. Yeah, she's a five year old, two foot six. It's just an aging process, which is a degeneration of the cells. Like what aging is. It's, it, it doesn't mean she grew into a 90 year old woman with a scarf going around the streets. What did you imagine it looked like? I don't know. I mean, she's aging fast. Yeah. Yes, but it's, it's more to. It's not. Yes. Yeah, because it was saying that a mum and dad are pretty stressed out about it. And I kind of thought, well, you'd be forever buying birthday presents. It's not like she's morphing through various ages. My God, look, she's 58 today. 59. We can't keep up. It's not that. It has, has the same effect as aging on the body. So a cellular level, there's a degeneration as quick as if she'd gone through. I don't know, I. I got this from you, I'm guessing, Carl, it's not. Like she's watching top of the pops. One week and she's loving it, and the next week she's going. I can't understand what they're saying. Yeah, I remember when I was four and a half, they were real bands. Club seven were excellent. But what's this tripe s club? But boy, she wants a fag. She's five years old, Carl, but she's. Got to experience everything in a short spell of time. Do you know? I mean, you've got time to sort of. I think you're thinking of her life like that fat boy slim video where it starts off with something crawling out of the sea and then it evolves really quickly over three minutes. I don't know. That's not the case, Carl. Her mind isn't. She isn't aging much in her mind at the same time. No, she's not living the life, a whole life in like, you know, three weeks. It's just her body is degenerating quicker than it should. So if you worked in odd bins, you wouldn't serve her with a bottle of wine? No, I probably would. Well, unless she had some id, whichever. On top of all her other problems, he wouldn't even give her a glass of. Yeah, a bottle of wine and her. Id wouldn't look right because he's aging all the time. The photo would never match. Yeah, look at my hair there. That was last week. Well, it was 2002. We don't know enough about it, so. No, I haven't seen it. So. Yeah, maybe we should apologize because that could sound colors and cruel, because I don't know what. I don't know what. The whole. It was just the title. The vibe of the. Yeah, I know the title. That excited, like, I'm older than my mom. No, it was the child that's older than her mother. Yeah. So that's what that was. Where there's some good stuff on in the week. Didn't see that. So maybe someone have on video for you. Yeah. If you taped it and, you know, send it in, watch it all fast. Forward, she'd really age then. Imagine that. Well, we've got some weird stuff to talk about, though. What? Coming up later. What? Darren Brown. Oh, yeah, that was interesting. I know. The fact that the track we've just talked about, him asking me nicely not to squeeze his head when people around and a girl who ages so quickly, she should be served in odd bins. And he goes, but we've got some weird stuff coming up. That's cold world. Yeah. That's our song in it, Carl. Leave all this misery behind, isn't it? Turing breaks painkiller. That's what I could do. I could sort of give you a little local anaesthetic and squeeze your head and see how far it would go. Before start that when I get back off holiday. Ah. Dear Rick, I was watching music television this morning just before I came in. I love it. I love it. I kind of agree with Wyclef Jean. Yeah. Just because she dances loco, it don't make her a ho. No, but I can't help but feel she's not helping a case. I mean, she's there every night, basically, getting them out for the lads. I know, for money. I mean, I don't mean that she's a hoe or a whore, as we say. But I can't but think if you. If you think people are sagging you off, calling you a whore, get a different job. Because I'll tell you this. You like the money, yeah? She likes to cheat. She likes to easy money. I'll say this, if. Well, basically exposing and sort of wobbling round your means, tits and ass doesn't make you a ho. What does? I don't know. What does. Look at Carl's head. Just went down there. Just went down. He doesn't like this sort of filter. He's thinking about Maxine. Pot on a red shoes Maxine. Oh, is it? Yeah, it's a moving song. What's the horse about at the end? Horse? I've never understood that. Never understood that. It's Wyclef doing all right, is he? I'm always bit concerned about the Fujis because I heard Lauryn Hills, not her new albums. Pretty, not very good. Naz, or whatever his name is. I don't know what's happened to him. He's disappeared off the face of the earth. Soft spot for him. Or I think he popped up too much. I think it was a bit ubiquitous, jumping up when everyone's, you know, he's a funny bloke as well. Wycliffe. Good luck. Good luck to all the. All the lads from the fugees. Any other bands you're concerned about? Hepburn? What the hell? What has gone wrong with Hepburn? Oh, it does make me worry. It does make me worry. Well, do you want to give some stuff away? I suppose so, Carl. We could set it up. What do you think? What is it? Which of your many competitions is. This song's a phrase talking of competitions, I remember last week a big argument that Karl kicked Steve off the team because he was getting a little bit uppity and trying to take it over. Pub quiz. Pub quiz, yeah. But then you let him back in, didn't you? Well, he was all right. He came to me afterwards and said, you know, you're not going to kick me off, are you? He came back sort of, I suppose. Begging. Was it embarrassing or. No, it's just, you know, he learned his lesson. He realized he's overset the mark. Like you have this week. Yeah. Do you know, I mean, we've all learned a lesson. Yeah, we all learned a lesson. But I won the quiz, didn't I? And you didn't. Well, that doesn't matter. Please bear in mind just taking part, the counts, Rick. Yeah, sure. I wasn't winding you up in the quiz though, was I? And your all your team was older? Yeah. What's that got to do with it? You've got a collective age, your team of about 300. No, one of them is. Only one of them is actually five. But she just. She's just aged a lot. I think when I took the eleven plus we were all around the same age. That's what I mean. Right. Your team was a lot older. What was our average age, would you say? Average age? Probably 30. Right. Yours at least 41. No, definitely. No, definitely. Only two of us were 41 and three were about 30. No rubbish. Yeah. Who's 30? Martin? Glen. Glenn's. Glenn's about 36. Yeah. Yeah. And you've got a better general knowledge? Yeah, yeah. We were cheating. We knew more. You just knew more stuff. Yeah. That's not allowed, is it? Proper quiz time? I wasn't wind you up, though, when I was. I wasn't gloating or anything, was I? No. So when you kept sort of counting it in front of me and, like. He hasn't got enough cash already, Carl? Can't say. Maybe. Gauche. Right. Is that tax free, that money? Yes, we've competed. So prize. Is that true, though? Is that. I think so. Prize money, isn't it? I don't know. Otherwise, I assume you'll be declaring that. Yeah, will. Yeah. Yeah. You'll be paying tax on that. Yeah. Because, you know, I mean, the tax man could contact you via XFM any time just to check that if you wanted to. Sure. Okay. Prizes to give away this week you've excelled yourself again. We've got, once again, Scotland rocks, the very best of scottish music. Texas, Deacon Blue and Jerry Rafferty. I'm just checking to see if Mideur and Hugh and gride, the resilos as well. Brilliant. Brilliant. That is great. So look forward to. Is Lulu on there or not? The wets. Are the wets on there all the wets or not? Fairground attraction. Brilliant. Brilliant. Is wee hooty McTove on there? Is jamboree. What's this? This is another arbitrary compilation called strange and Beautiful. The original, which is quite good. The new album by the White Stripes. The DVD walking with cavemen. That tv, the show that's on. On VHS, it's still got the price on there on VHS, in case you haven't seen it. Fight Club and the best selling book from Michael Moore's stupid white men. So actually, some quite good prizes there, Karl. What's this competition? Right. Song's a phrase. It's where I get a line that sort of is said a lot on the show. Or has been said quite a lot on the show. Yeah. Has this one stopped squeezing my head? No. Oh, I could have done that. But what we're doing is the Elephant man is my favourite film. Is that the phrase? Yeah, that's the phrase that we're looking at today. The Elephant man's my favorite film. It is as well, his favorite film. I know. Why is that again? Six. It's funny and sad and it set, you know exactly what you're gonna get. Yeah. They promise you an elephant man. That's exactly. Yes, I have seen it. It's good. Yeah. Yeah. Do you remember at the beginning that. Having that as your favorite film of all the hundreds of amazing. I mean. I mean, it's a good film and. It'S a moving film. Yeah. But I can't imagine the film I would watch endlessly again, care about a. Bloke with an elephant's edge. One of them that, you know, just sort of reminds you, you know, annoys. Me when he goes, I am not an animal. He is. Well, I mean, he speaks like one. Boy. He was a bit unfair because they never let him look in a mirror because he's a bit odd looking. It upset him. Yeah. So his eye was always a mess and that made him look worse than he actually was. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Good film. Get it out if you haven't seen it. That's the phrase today. Do you know, my friend introduced me to that film, and if you remember, at the beginning, there's a big montage because he is working in a zoo, isn't he? Or he's been kept in a zoo. And there's a sequence of various elephants, I think, actual elephants, kind of rampaging. And it's just quite a sort of moody, atmospheric montage. Is he keen to the elephants? My friend said to me, when we watch this, he said, what happens is he gets trampled on by some elephants and that's what makes him look like an elephant. And I went, right, and I watched it, I thought, that's not the case. And I tried to explain it to him and he's to this day still convinced that the elephant man. It's like when Spider man gets bitten by elephant man. The power of an elephant. Was it his mom? He never forgets. Be careful. Is it his mom? What? Wasn't his mam who was pregnant and then they ran over her? No, I don't think so. That's the impression I got from it. You are joking, aren't you? No, I thought I. Honestly. Anyway, right, so the phrase is, my favorite films. The Elephant man. These five songs make up that. That sentence. Yeah. Right. This week, have a listen, see if you can work out the songs. Email in. Ricky Gervaism dot co dot UK. Right. And you win. All that stuff Steve just said. So. Right, here we go, then. The Elephant man is my favorite film. That was mostly done. Genius. Let's hear it again. Five songs there. The elephant. Not so hard. This is my favorite film. Well, I thought we'd make it a bit easier. Make it a bit easier. Just. Just one more. The Elephant man. He's my favorite film. Email only. Ricky dot gervaisfm dot co dot uk brilliant. A bit of hip hop. Hooray. A bit of a rap classic, although you may not have heard it before. XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl the Cayman pilking. Pilkers? Little Pilkers? Little baldy, roundy, heady Pilkers. Oh, yeah, there's gone. There's a what's her name. If people go to the what's joking. There's not. There's not a what's her name. An actual what's her name. You are joking, Carl. No, it's just you reminded me. Little round bottle dead. Yeah. If they go to XFM co UK. Yeah. Slash Ricky. There's a picture on there. You know that picture did. Oh, that? I drew the one you drew with me. Open on. Did what XFM put on. Yeah, they look good. Can you get into it? What is it? XFM co dot UK. Forward slash Ricky. Right. And there's that little picture and people can sort of put bids in and the money goes to me, I assume. As I drew it. No, it's for some charity thing. So because I've read. I read something. I think there's been a bit of at least 50 pounds, which is pretty. No, that, I swear to God, I. Just saw earlier, I deleted it because I thought someone was winding us up. You deleted it? Well, I didn't know, did I? Didn't really. Keep me informed. Well, they just. Oh, easy. My phone call, isn't he? I think. I think you're an idiot, but sometimes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Just gonna check the power list. Top hundred most important people in radio. What's this list? Oh, it's just the most important people in radio. Oh, 56 Ricky Gervais. That's annoying. 56, let me see. Says 55. More important people than me. I love the fact there that I've beaten David Mansfield. He's a controller of capital. Yeah, arbitrary. The radio academy power is the top 100. And you're what? Number 56 Gervais, XFM. I noticed we're not mentioned, Carl. What's on there? You know, stinging that. I just thought considering the amount of work you put into this show. Don't get me started. Are you on here elsewhere, Carl? Too busy. Chris Moyles is number 96. Oh, that's good. That's good news, isn't it? He'll be off the list by next year, I hope. Gone. Right. Who's number one? Number one is Phil Roberts. I don't know who that is. Right. Wouldn't you think that Marconi would have got a mention? Marconi? Now what stations he on? That's the point, because I got one in television. You thought John Logie Baird would have got mentioned. Yeah. Although it's not ever, is it? Again, I'll slip out of that by next year, I'd have thought. Oh, dear. Just checking to see. Oh, yeah, Doctor Fox goodies on there at number 39. I'm assuming his medical qualifications have also been. Yeah, that sneaks you up the list. Yeah, typical Pete Waterman. Yeah. Number 35. That makes sense. Important guy. Can we just give the website so they can read this at a leisure? Because this really isn't radio, is it? Right, well, XFM. No, that website, if they want to see the most. I don't know where it is. I'm just saying. XFN dot co dot UK. Ricky, if you want to see that picture. And whoever bidded. 50 quid, if you can send the email again. Bid. Whoever bid. Whoever bidded. We should start picking you up on you grammar. I mean, we're hardly ones to speak, but, you know. I squeezed, I squeezed. I'll tell you what I listened back to. Carl was worried about last week's show because he said there was too much screaming and shouting and just nonsense and eating. It was a bit like, it's a. Knockout last week and I listened back to it and it is. It was without doubt the most appalling piece of radio I have ever heard in my life. Really. I didn't know what I was saying. I was. And he's going, you're going, Carl there, eating a hamburger. It was bizarre. Just half an hour, if anyone didn't know us or. I've never heard of XF, just like going heart one of the XFM. When I thought, listen to this guy coming out as well, it was absolute. Honestly, it was like a mental ward. To be fair, though, at the best of times, you sound like you're setting the Evening standard. Oh, God, we should have the worst bits available, should we? Just the worst bits of broadcasting ever. So where I didn't finish the sentence or it was just shouting, or a record, I mean, there were swear word slips out and just put them all on a CD, like, you know, like Penky put out the rest of his phone calls. Exactly. Yeah. I haven't got the worst radio show. In the world ever. Yeah, that's what I call bollocks. Calm down. That's just cheapened it. Oh, no, it's a record. Oh, tits. Good to see those boys still rocking. That's AC DC. Shook me all night long. And it's a film on a 4.9. I'm looking to trade with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Have you got the result to the quiz, Carl? Yeah, I'll just play it one more time. It was songs, a phrase. Is this the last time we're doing this? I thought so. I thought it worked better this week because it was actually doable. Yeah, that makes a difference. Carl. We haven't done Carl's an idiot yet. Carl, you're an idiot. Have we? Oh, that's the reason to keep it. Maybe we can end with that one when you come back. Right, well, the five songs that made up this little thing here was mystery is beautiful blues. Eels, innocent man, Billy Joel in my favorite waste of time. Owen Paul beam. Rhapsody. Queen. Girls on film. Duran Duran. It sounded like this. The Elephant man is my favorite film. Hang on, was Bohemian Rhapsody in there? Yeah. Well, we're gonna give that to Piley. He just calls himself Piley. Ian pyle. Good rope, Piley. What's happened to Anders? Well, I'm just gonna say, actually, we've not had correspondence from Richard Dickey Anders for some time. The Dick Meister. Dick Meister General is naughty. Naughty, insulting ways. Yeah, Anderson used to email regularly. Anderson, get on your computer. Get in touch, mate. Hold on, though, to be fair, he was listening when we were pretty shoddy. If he's listened to the last three weeks, I think we owed a little apology from you, Dixter. Exactly. Absolutely. Listen, Piley, we want to send you all those goodies, including scottish rock, but we don't have your address. So email in your address and we can send it off to you. All right? More adverbs? Yeah. Bit of snoop. Beautiful. XFM 104.9. Gervais merchant, Pilkington. Carl had a treat in the week, didn't he? He couldn't believe his luck. We know Darren Brown. You know Darren Brown, the sort of magician mind reader fella. It's more special than that. Well, called me up in town, said, jonathan, we bring it on, Carl. He went, pleasure. Carl's very cynical, saying, well, he won't get into my head. Yep. Great, wasn't it? It was brilliant. Can I ask him questions? I went, well, no, he's social. He went, I'm not coming. I went, well, I asked. I want him to know how he did that trick. When he said, you've got the winning ticket. I went, don't. It was not the Talia. He's a magician. He went, well, it's not worth it then. I can't quiz him. But he came along still dead, though, didn't I? Got in there with the questions that the people wanted to know about. Yeah, yeah, go on. What do you ask him? What do you find out? I said, how do you do that? I love the fact that the first half hour, me, Steve and Darren Brown were convincing Carl that he didn't see a ghost when he was five. Yeah. And then we got onto the tricks. Yeah, well, you. I mean, it will live in my mind. He won't get inside my head. Yeah, and he got inside your head magnificently, Carl, didn't he? I mean, were you not amazed? I mean, we. Darren promised, actually, that he would come on the show in the future and then you, the listeners, can. Can see how he can baffle, amaze and just generally freak out. I think we should film him. Everything that happens. Right, because it's just a waste. Because you're only getting half it when you hear what Carl has to say. Because his face honestly says a thousand words. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? It's just. I think we should film it. Just put on a DVD of Carl's facial expressions. This is Carl thinking he saw a ghost. This is Carl thinking they were gonna clone a man moth. Yeah. It's just different. Explain what he did and what marveled you so much. Right. Yeah. He comes in, he sits down. I'm a bit, sort of. Bit sexy. Straight away. You're spooked by him. Straight away. Yeah. There's a weird thing about him. So anyway, he sat there and I'm watching him because he was naked, checking, you know, seeing. Seeing what he's, you know, looking at and stuff. So. So anyway, he gets his. Gets his paper out and I think, right, it's gonna do a bit of trickery in that. And he says to me, right, write down a number and a name, right? It was between a two digit number, a two digit number and a name of anyone you know. Yeah. Right. Now, the thing is, I thought the name, because I was telling Steve earlier about the. About the kid at school who I fell out with, right, over that girl who was called Iris. Yeah. So that name was like, in my mind, ready to go, because I didn't want to use anybody's name who I knew, sort of now, because maybe you've mentioned it in the past, so, I mean, I couldn't say, susan, I need. I knew anyway. Yeah, yeah. Well, do you know? I mean. So I picked a name. Yeah, well, I thought you might have been thinking about anti nora. So I picked this name, right, that you three don't. Didn't really know about, right. Number just came to mind, right. So we were never 42. Right. He said, right, just keep saying it over and over in your head. And I'm there and he's saying all these sort of different numbers at me and I'm trying to throw him off a little bit. Every time he said a number that was nothing like 42, sort of smiling, looking a bit nervous. Yeah. Don't know if you caught that. Right. I just. All I could see was you looking so blank. When he said, let your mind go blank. You'd realize he picked on the wrong. Person then, so you had to squeeze his head to get it going again. I said. I said, so Darren, if in doubt, he'll be thinking of monkeys. And Darren looked at Carl and he said, were you thinking of monkeys? He said, I tried not to. And I thought of them all. That's true as well. So I'm there thinking of these numbers and that, and then he said, right, let's just talk about other stuff for a bit. Right. So I was like, well, I'm not going to say anything. Yeah, right. Because I don't want you to catch me out. But then when we were talking, I was trying to, like, knock him off track. I mean, I wasn't. I mean, I played a bit of hardball with him. Yeah. I was like, say, because we were talking about aliens and that as well, weren't we? And I was saying, well, you know, they might come and land again in 2060. Clever. I mean, dropping in different numbers and that. So doing all that playing on his own game. And I think I had him for a bit on the ropes. Yeah. So, anyway, comes down to the. The time when he's telling me that the name and the number. Yeah. And, well, they explained what he actually did. I mean, he just went. He said to think of a number at the end of it and. And he said, oh, is it an eye? And you went, it wasn't an eye, but there is no. Okay. And anyway, got. He got. You got the name Harris. Then he went. He went and said, do you an extrovert? And he wrote down these numbers. Well, actually, yeah, he wrote down some numbers and he said that if you're an extrovert, these are the numbers you tend to choose. If you're an introvert, these are the numbers you tend to choose. And he wrote them down and he said, I don't think you're really an introvert. I don't think you're this. I don't think you're that. Da da da. I think he came up with the number 32, didn't he? Said, you're thinking number 32. You said to him, no way. You couldn't believe your luck, could you, when you call him out? But he said. He said it's either 42 or 32, didn't he? Yeah, well, no, but that. It was beside the point because then he said, you know, rather brilliantly. Hang on a minute. If you just add up these numbers. Here, that adds up to 42. It was a magic number. That's 42. That's 42 across diagonally there. That box is 42 added up on the page, whether you go across, sideways, down, across, whatever, always added up to 42, which. And you've got the name Harris, which freaks you out. He freaked me out. I kept saying, so how do you do it? How do you do it? And he wasn't telling me. I was talking to people at work about him and one lad said, apparently, that the trick that he uses is the same thing that Hitler did. Play record. No, no, seriously, just apparently it's the same thing. Because he was saying, what? Play record? No, just let me finish. Because now I've even run it by. Other people to check if I'm play record company. Because the people in the XFM office. Yeah, I mean, they're pretty wise. They're up on that. No, he used it in a different way, player. No, let me hear it. Let me. Power of suggestion, apparently. And when Hitler used to do his big speeches to people. Yeah, what should we play? Come on, finish. Finish your. Well, that's. That's about it. Ian Canfield, a few different people, all right? The big. Yeah, the big thinkers out there, the brain boxes. But anyway, right? It's because, I mean, Magnus. Magnuson works Sonic, so now, doesn't he? Right? Or was it Paxman? Was he doing that? Blew me away, right, that. The fact that he got the name, he got the number. Spooky bit, right? I'm walking home, I called you up a couple of times and I left a message on your phone, because it was just amazing. Not only was he good at magic, but his maths was brilliant. That thing adding up to 42, how did he do that? I mean, we didn't even make a big deal. Yeah, imagine him on countdown. He'd even know what they were going to write down. So a bit of a wasted talent. I should see him again about that. He asked him, he said, why do you not unmock around on telly? Then he went, sorry, why are you mucking around on telly? And he said, you could make some serious money. I think Steve went, well, he does all right. He went, nah, but he did that, the ticket thing all day. Yeah, but didn't you say to him, you should be working for the police force? I said, yeah, should be in a police station, he could help people out. I mean it's not a daft idea, is it? Not really. Right, so anyway, right, so I get home, still I'm calling different people up. Walking home, I couldn't believe it. Yeah, I called Suzanne up telling her about it, it. And she's like, slow down. She's like a little kid who's just been on a fairground ride or something. Yeah, yeah, slow down. Right, so I'm telling her, call me mum and dad up. My dad wasn't that impressed. No, of course, it's all been done before. He wasn't impressed with little donkey, was he? Going. So I get in, he probably had. To knee back down to the phone box, right, do some thieving. Yeah, yeah, we've forgotten bread. No, I'm just going on the phone box. So I get into my flat, right? And what they do in my flat where I live, they put the post in like these little pigeon holes, right? And I don't normally check them out. I leave it for Suzanne to do, right, but this time for some weird reason I thought, right, I'll check it. See, we've got any post. Open it up. There's only this. A letter for Miss Harris. Yep, there it is. Bonafide, in front of us. A letter addressed to a Miss Harris. Well, does she live there? No, it's my address. She doesn't live there. Did she ever. Dunno, it doesn't matter. It stays weird in it. But what we normally, I think there was a guy who lived there called Yaki Shoki. Mister 42. It was definitely wasn't an iris. Right. This is the first time we've had a letter for this woman. Yes, right, but what are you claiming? Because Darren Brown himself admits that it is not paranormal, it is not supernatural, it is a trick. It's a trick. But he would say that, wouldn't he? Hitler said that. Player record. Well, can we open this? No, it's illegal. No, but I'm thinking if we don't. For someone's like 42nd, right? You can't open that letter. Go and put it back or put note. You cannot open that letter. Why not? It's. You can't open someone else's mail because you think Darren Brown's supernatural. What if we steamed open, then resealed it. No one would know. It's only a letter. You can't uh. Right. I'm. Yeah, you can, but I've jumped you. I don't want any part of it. Carl, I think you should open it. No, you open. I'm not opening it. It's against the law. You should open it there. They won't send you to prison. You'll get off. There's no cure. I'm looking. I'm tempted to open it. Do you want to open? Sleeve. There you go. No, I'm not. No, I'm not gonna open it. But I think you should. Definitely. Six different ways. By the cure from the album the head on the door. We've enjoyed that. The head on the door, Carl. Oh, it was only four weeks ago you were talking about a head and a door. Exactly. The door got a number on it. Oh, dear. So what? Opening it. I can't open it because as the producer, right. Oh, yeah. Because you're standing in society is such that they'd make a real example of you. That a producer of a tin pot radio show once a week. Yeah. He should know better. He can press buttons and talk at the same time. Sending down that you. They wouldn't try you in an adult court. You would get away. You get away with it. Just. They knew you speaking for a little while, and they would. They would. That the judge would end up squeezing your head and letting you off. It'd be like those people who train monkeys to break in. Remember down in south London we talked about in the past and they were going around robbing stuff and they trained to do it. Yeah. These monkeys would go in trouble. It would have been the keepers. So, you know, I think XFM would probably take the rap. Will you open it? No, I can't be seen to open it. No, he's a writer director. Exactly. So am I. I can't be seen to it. Well, I'm having no part of this. That's against the law, but. Right. I'm having no part of it. Open it. Corey started now. Right. The thing is, right, if it's important, we can say, maybe she's listening, but. Do you need the stress? What? Could be anything. What are you gonna say? We can say, oh, and if you are listening, Miss Harris, you have got gonorrhea. Call the clinic. Do you know? I mean, it could be anything. Oh, dear. Oh, well, I think. I think my, um, talk did well, what is it? It's the number 42 on there. What is it? Can you say? Be careful? What? Let me see what it is. What is it? Dear sir, madam, your periodical dental inspection is now to you. Would you kindly contact the surgery to make an appointment? Harris. Misses Harris, if you're listening, your periodical dental structure inspection is now due. You'd like to. You might want to contact the dental surgeon that you normally go to. She's got. Could have a faulty tooth. I don't believe it. Faulty tooth. Oh my God. God, that Darren's good. Darren Brahms good, isn't it? Oh dear. Awesome blue. But. Carl, is that really seven and a half years old? Blur. The universal. All right. Just made me think. Sure, Carl. I asked you in the week, didn't I? What was that kid when that was out? She wasn't born so she's about 30. Well, I think that's the first time we've officially broken the law on it. Don't think we've broken the law before. On air with a dentist appointment. Well, we haven't broken the law, Steve. He has. You're right. And he should know better. He's the top producer of a tin pot radio station. Carl, Ricky and I were doing some writing in the week. We needed a little get a little book of zodiac types. What's your thought on. Just to make sure it was good luck, you know, to be writing. Yeah. Yeah. What do you make of all that stuff? Horoscopes. Do you have any thoughts on that? Now and again I'll read it, but sure, I believe if it's good. Yeah. If it's not, just go, what story? That's perfect though, that. But that is. That's that raison d'etre. That is those people who do zodiacs exist on that piece of philosophy. Yeah, I believe it. If it's good. Exactly. And that's why when you have breakdowns, people don't go, you're a nasty little piece of work. You're pug. Ugly little twat. And you're never mounting. It's things like, hmm. You're probably too generous for your own good. Yeah, you like to keep a distance, but you like to love. You're a warm person. It's always stuff like that, isn't it? People go, I suppose I am to you. Yeah. Yeah, that is me all over. Do you know what I mean? You're a creative person who thinks they're not a creative person. Exactly. You've got a wonderful sense of humor. Yeah. What starts on you? Mine changes. I'm on the edge. Right, okay. Even makes that complicated. Even makes twaddle complicated. No, I'm just. It changes depending what paper you read. Yeah. All right. 3 September. So I think most of the time Virgo, I think. Well, write that down, listeners. 23 September. And come around and give him the bumps. Well, according to this. I mean, you've been criticizing this, Rick. Sure. You've been saying that there's maybe not anything in this. Yeah, well, hang on, let me just read some. Is this going to change my mind? Am I going to eat my words? The typical Virgo. Okay. The physical appearance of the typical Virgon. Yeah. High forehead. That's not true. Cranium may seem too big in comparison with the face. Look at Carl. Look at Carl. But how specific is that? Has an extremely large forehead. Has a high hairline. That's not true, though, is it? Maybe quite tall. What are the blokes like? Often has 1ft turned in more than the other. What they just described. Rain man. What is that? How can I be specific? Well, that's why it sounds like Carl. 1Ft turned in. Yeah. Oh, have they even bothered doing one for you? Because there isn't many people. Hang on a minute, let him finish things. No, I'm just saying. Go on, what are you saying? I sort of think I'm fairly average looking, but I'm saying, have they wasted a page in that book for whatever you are? Me being dissing him and stuff. And you've been nice. Hang on a minute. I don't think you can be a virgo. And because it says that they are normally quick, alert and intelligent. But no, actually, I have to say, it says here, behavior and personality traits of the Virgo and as a child is an excellent mimic. Can learn many things in a short time. Not really true, is it? Rarely questions authority, but frequently questions facts. You never question facts. Yeah. You never question authority. Scared of authority. Yeah. Your usual times. Very upset if teased. That's true, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Can't take a bit of stick. Too much pressure if you can't stand the heat gun at the kitchen. Yeah. What to teach you young Virgo and myths, fairy stories, make believe daydreams and how to use imagination should all be taught to young Virgo. And so they have plenty of magical moments to remember in their adult years where they are often alone. I'm changing my mind. This is good stuff. This is really good stuff. Alright, well, let's see. What are you. Well, I don't think we should talk about that. Yeah, let's have a look. It says the Virgon is. I love some of the specifics of this vergon is an employer is excellent as the boss of a small company. Yeah, yeah. Yeah yeah. Don't get him on a Tuesday. It's probably stamp collecting then. Yeah, he loves a bit of haddock. Okay, let me look at mine. Oh, that is good though. Carl in it. That is you all over. I've changed your mind. It's brilliant. It's a real science. They've really put their work in with this one. Let me see Sagittarius. Sarah Jones. Sagittarian is a happy, playful little clang, little greets everyone. Yeah, let me see Sagittarius at home. He's only gonna read the good bits, though. Any. If that's it. What can it say? Have they done yours in sort of small print? You've got special eyes. I don't know what that insult is, Karl. What kind of an insult is that? Wow. Look at his face. Boo hoo hoo. It won't do. Listen to the Galaga boys and stop crying your heart out on XFM 104.9. No need to. Monkey news. So now is it time? Time for monkey news. Can we have the jingle? Oh, chimpanzee that, monkey news. I love the jingle. Right, well, yeah, let me queue it up. So chimpanzee that, monkey news. Oh, it's brilliant. Got a lot to live up to. Now, I'll be honest with you, often that jingle is more fun than the monkey news. Yeah. So you've got to excel yourself this week. Well, it's. There's been a lot going on in the monkey world. Yeah. I was looking at the Guinness Book of Records that we bought last week. What you bought what that I bought? Is it still wet? I was cleaning the tea off it. I was having a, having a little read through and there was some monkey stuff in there. There was. This isn't the actual story. I'm just telling you what it's like looking up monkey news all week. It's like the making of monkey news, which is actually available on DVD. It's, you know, twelve minutes unseen footage. Just the making of monkey news, which is my favorite bit in a way. If you enjoy monkey news, see how it happens from conception to. It's all put together. Yeah, go on. Yeah. What's the typical Monkey news day? Well, there was some stuff about a monkey in the Guinness Book of Records. I think it had the record for asking for a cup of coffee in 23 different ways. That's good. Just to show the monkey news is getting bigger and people are covering it. Donald McIntyre, he was on, on BBC. Yeah, on Monday. No no, he hasn't moved over yet. This is something that he did for the BBC. Right. So that was. That was pretty good. That was about. Well, it wasn't good. It's pretty, pretty sad, really. What? He was doing these things, you know, like last week we were doing cheapest chimps. Yeah. And someone emailed in saying, you know, Donald McIntyre is doing cheapest chimps. Really? And it was about. I bet he wasn't. I bet Donald McIntyre did not do a program called cheap as chimps. Title. No. But you could tell where they've got the format from. Sure. I mean, sure. And it was, it was about gorillas and how much you can get one for. But the problem was, because they're that pricey, they were sort of. Cool. Then. Don't. Yeah, forget it. Yeah, okay. I mean, in, say, in the making of monkey news and cheapest chimps. Not, not. And you'll know as harmed. Go on. Well, anyway, today's. Today's story is emailed in. So you didn't even do anything towards it. So when you say, I've been working on monkey news, what, you printed that out? So it's the making of monkey news. You checking your email. I'm always looking at different options. You know how much is going on. This one makes me laugh when he says he's really busy. Yeah, I'm doing other stuff and I'm doing other stuff. People are sending him monkey news. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You get an email. Is it from Reuters? Well, listen, it's from Steve. Okay, now, what it is is this monkey, right? Yeah. Don't know where it was, but there's a bit before the monkey. Anyway, right, this is. No, listen, right, it's a bank. There's this bank, right? Busy bank. Normal day. Everything's going normal, right? Busy bank, people going in, doing what they do, seeing about mortgages and stuff. Yeah, everything's normal. Everyone's happy. Right? So anyway, it's quite busy. One day, fella comes in with a gun and a bowl of clava. Right? I'll tell you now, Carl, if this fella turns out to be any ape or monkey related species, you're never doing this again. So just, if you want to finish it, it's at your own risk. But if this fella who robbed the bank turns out to be a chimpanzee, that's the end of monkey news. Okay, let's hear the end. It's a. It's a lovely day in a lovely bank. Everyone's happy. It's normal. Comes in, in the balaclava. Man comes in. Is it a man starts waving a gun around. Let me finish. The story. Starts waving a gun around. Yeah, up to no good. So everyone's thinking, oh, God, you know what? Shouldn't come in here. It's not gonna be a good day, I'm told. Is the man. Shut up. Let's hear it. Everything you know. Oh, God. He's telling everyone to get down on the floor. In English? Yeah. You think so? Yeah. So everyone's panicking. Everyone's getting on the floor thinking, this is it. This is, you know, it's all over. Yeah. Just when you think, you know, it could. All bad news. Yeah, it's all bad news. Doors swing open. Little monkey wanders in. God, it's worse. Shut up, Rick. Little monkey wanders in, right? The robbers, like, what's going on here? He's telling it to get down on the floor. Don't think it's taking any notice. No, it was just busy asking for coffee. It runs in. I don't know if it was gonna withdraw or deposit. Wanders in, right? Goes up to the robber. Where did it. Where did it come from? Shut up, will you? Let him finish the story and then ask questions. That's only fair. Okay? Wanders in, runs up to the fellow with the gun, takes the gun and the bag of money off him. Everyone's like, yay, you know, we've been saved. Then the monkey starts backing out with the gun and the money. Shut up. Don't. Sit down. Sit down. And he doesn't story. It does a runner with the. With the money and they're gone. No one's seen it since. You are an idiot. I mean, you are. You have said some stupid things in your time. What are you talking about? Story that. What are you talking about? What do you mean? It backed out. It came in. Whether was it accomplice? Was it an opportunist monkey robbery? What are you talking. Think, Carl, think. I know. He's mad. That's. That's the idea of monkey news. We're telling people how, like, our monkeys are pretty, you know, the mental. They're up to no good. What do you think? They've never seen the monkey since. What, do you have a getaway car waiting? Did he swing his way to freedom? Where was this? There's no details. Don't talk rubbish. Well, Steve. Steve emailed it in. He's got it off the net. And the funny thing is. Yeah, the funny thing is, it wasn't just him who sent it. I had that a couple of times. So a few people obviously read the story and said, you know, that'll be good for monkey News. It doesn't say anymore. It doesn't say if he went off to Spain. It doesn't say, you know what, you know, if he's on crime watch, it doesn't say any of that. It's just saying that's what he did. That's the story. And that's what monkey. I've heard that they're making a movie version with Phil Collins, so I look forward to that. And Judy Waters. So that's. That's this week's Monkey news. If you've got any, you know, bother. And, you know, that is the end. That's the end of Monkey news. No more monkey news. This is bit queen. It says here in this email, Rick, it's got to be true. All right, 17 to one. Nice. Drew that one again, boys. Metal Mickey Suede on XFM 104.9. Well, nearly over with Ricky, Steve and Carl. I've done another little sketch for your, Carl, because I was excited by the fact that we raised that money. So I've done. It's not over yet. It's like people go to the website and if they think it's worth more than 50, they can say, I'll give you 55. What's it actually? Put that one little one on. It's all three of us in it. Well, they haven't done that yet. No, but they can put that on next week and they can frame it for. If they have a look. XFM Co. UK forward slash Ricky, never look at it. If you want it, just pay some money. And now it be worth a bit of money when? In a few years when we're all dead. Now, listen, Carl, you're going on holiday. You need a little rest, don't you? Yeah. What's it. What's the. What's the vibe? What's the vibe of the day? What was the. What's the. Just the crack on holiday. Come on. Where you going? Madeira. Right, good. It's for Suzanne's dad, right? My girlfriend's dad, he's 60, so. Yeah, that's the average agent in Madeira checking this. Quite, yeah. My damo went to Madeira and he was worried about sort terrorism on the plane. And he looked around, he thought, well, if someone gets up, someone arrest them to the floor. And he really looked around and he was the only one he realized could have got out of his seat quickly enough. So you'll enjoy. It's quite quiet, it's nice. It'll be all right. I mean, it's the first time a mum and dad have been away, so whatever. Abroad. Yeah. So they're worrying about. They just don't understand the rules and stuff. So they panicking a bit. And then in the week they're gonna take livestock. Yeah. Are they filling loads of durags with heroin as we speak? No, but do they know about passports expiring, don't they? I mean, they're not completely stupid. They know about all that. Right? Yeah. And he called up in the week, one of the questions said, what's the best thing when you're going abroad? It's the best thing to use to carry tea bags. So it was like, what you worrying about that for? They'll sell, they'll sell tea bags out there. He's like, well, we want to take our own. It's like, he'll sell tea bags. Yeah. And he's worrying about that. He's saying, can I put it in a glass jar? So put it in a glass jar. He said, oh, I'll bubble wrap it. So he's bubble wrapping a tea thing is just, I mean, it is annoying me a bit because it's meant to be a week off from, from you annoying me. And already he's niggling me. But you are easily wound up. You are a very finickety little fussy person. You don't like any, the slightest bit of pressure. See, I thrive on pressure. Working here, working there, always doing stuff. Monkey news. Oh yeah, monkey news. I got an email, I read it to on air. It's rubbish. But that's one feature that's might be done. That's all I have to do. I'll tell you what, when I'm away next week, do monkey news and see what you can find out. Right. Oh, there's a challenge. So you can do. You've already sold on that, the Guinness Booker records one, so you can't use that. Right. We're gonna find the best monkey news ever. Carl, what was it you said to me that, because, I mean, the thing is that you don't really like people, do you? That's the truth of it. People annoy you. Don't they wind you up? Yeah. You said to me about friends, you don't. He doesn't like friends anymore. He doesn't want any friends. Is it because one day they'll ask me to help and change attire? Yeah. What was it? You know, it's always hassle. Well, the tyree sits and swings on, you mean. It's just they call up, they ask for stuff they want favors doing. Yeah, they want it. They want to pint. They want to chat to you because they like. Yeah, I know. They're a pain in the ass. I tell you what, Carl, you're better off without a mate. Although, to be fair, Rick, friends like you. Yeah. You're not judging them on me, are you? You're not judging all they do, sort of, you know. You know, some friends will never touch you around the head or see you. For a week, am I? I'm gonna get a little squeezing. Can I come around there and squeeze? You squeeze them in. Now, quick squeeze. That's not a Benny hill slap there on the. All right, that's. That's enough of that. Okay. I'm not. Squeeze it. Squeeze it. All right, that's excellent. For a week. Yeah. All right, see you next week. See you later. See you, Rick. Have a good holiday. All right, excellent.",
