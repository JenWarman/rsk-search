I'm being honest. Go on. There's some great tunes. Yeah, we've got our, there's too many to mention. Don't mention. Where's about 20 actually, is there? We could mention them. Looking forward to it. I've got a brand new feature. Okay. You know, I'll do my film with you. Loving it. And you know, we do run for the covers and song for the lovers and got a new feature. That film sounds good, right? It's not the film review. It's a, it's a track from a film. That's brilliant, Rick. Yeah, that's absolutely. That film sounds good. Yeah, something like that. People will be desperately looking forward to that. And there'd just be some chat as well. There'd just be some nattering. Karl, have we got anything to give away this week? No. Ooh, it's a shame. Yeah. Quite like giving stuff away makes me feel quite powerful. Does, you know, in the week, is there any meetings like, oh, what should we give, like Ricky and Steve to give away? Cause I mean, I see lots of trailers for the breakfast show and that enterprise and that. Or do they go? They go, who comes on Saturdays? Saturdays? I don't work Saturdays. No, but they're still on the air Saturdays. Is it? Who listens on a Saturday? Yeah, between one and three. Oh, that's the worst time, isn't it? They sort of hear you taking the mickey out of what tickets you're given. And I think this week you could have had Saint Etienne, but they said, no, we'll hold them back. I love her being punished. Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you what we've been punished for. For being subversive and rock and roll. Is that a crime, Rick? I don't think so. High five. You've got to hit the hand. Sounds embarrassing. Taller than me, aren't you? Just hit high five. Yes. Rebel Motorcycle Club there in loveburns. XFM 104.9. We're really swinging now. We are so much better than last week. Last week was a point I don't want to talk about. It wasn't too bad, actually, was it? Apparently. No. You know, I said we were really offense. Steve was hungover and I was tired. We couldn't bothered. And they were going, no, as good as any other week, which is pretty disappointing. You want them to go, well, I'll tell you what, it was the worst one ever and it was still brilliant. It was still making, as opposed to. It was one of the best, but rubbish. Yeah. Yeah. Good. So we're gonna really. Yeah, we're gonna up the ante today. Yeah. Come on, Karl. Cheers. Let's make this, Carl, let's make this the best show ever. All right. Do you have a big group hug? Yeah. Oh, Carl, come on. Let's have a big group lick. Yeah, Carl, come on. Look at his little face. Look at his face. You can see why the ladies love him. He's a cute guy. No, you're a cute guy, and I'm not having a go. I genuinely think you are, so don't have a go back at me. Oh, I got some news for you, Steve. Go on. Where is it, Carl? Where is that thing? Right. Ar company magazine are compiling a 50 most eligible bachelor's feature. Ding dong. The May issue 2002. Right. These are the requirements. Right. Single. Right. That means available, not just unmarried, age 20 to 30. You're well in there. I'm straight in there. C. D. What will see. C is, um. It says, good looking. Fine. Yeah. I'm eligible so far. And it says not. Oh, no. This is what rules you out, probably. It says, not necessarily Brad Pitt esque. And you are a little bit. So they say it must be british. And come from one of the following regions. London, southeast, southwest. You know, that's me. I think they just name all the regions of Britain. Yes. They could just say from Britain. Really? Employ what? Sorry, Carl. Go on. Is there a Hyatt restriction or anything like that? Well, we're literally. So what is this? Is this a serious thing? What is it? It's the most eligible bachelor. This is so me. Do you know any of the boys. Who'D be perfect for us company girls? Past bachelors have included tv presenters. Derma O'Leary. Yeah. Hey, I mean with Derma O'Leary. He knows me. He's not really on, isn't he? Yeah. Jamie Fiesta. It's not most eligible person who knows a bachelor. The models Rob Warrington and James Polanski. The singers Lyndon, David hall and Richard Blackwood. Yeah. Wouldn't necessarily consider him a singer. Controversial. I'm so. He's having a dig at Blackwood. Hey, I'll tell you this. I was watching, or I don't suppose watch it, but I saw the trailer for the farmer wants a wife. Oh, yeah. Right. Which is the show. Which you mentioned. Yeah, you did. Which is a show where I think farmers, because obviously it's very difficult for them to meet with. Wants a wife. And I'm thinking, hello. Hi, dear. Steve Merchant wants a wife. It's not bad. It's a tv show who sounds a bit like a farmer. Exactly. What I'm saying is, I don't mind the public voting for the woman, you know, if that's how it happens, I don't mind. You know, who cares, you know? I'll have anything, whatever they can choose. Be fine, you know. See that, I think, yeah, Steve Merchant wants a farmer. That'd be even better. Steve Merchant wants it. Yeah, Steve Merchant wants it. I'm thinking sort of maybe the Bravo channel on cable, you know, or ITV. Two. Yeah, it's an idea, Rick. I'm just flying out the flagpole. Yeah, we're thinking about that. Don't phone in. It's not worth it. Let's play some more music. There is a slim shady in all of us. That was Eminem, XFM 104.9. Steve. Yeah, I was just. Actually, I was just thinking. Cause Carl, I'm probably thinking, you know, he likes to have a little dig every so often about, you know, my success with the ladies. No, no, no. I tell you, you'd have been proud of me last night. No, listen, you'd have been proud of me. Cause I was walking back from the shops, I was carrying two cans of weak lager. It was Friday night, Rick. Yeah, time to go a bit crazy. And there was this woman coming the other way who must have been sort of 50, 55, just staring on the street, dressed in kind of like rhinestone cowboy style outfit. Really weird. Never seen it before, was it? Part wasn't Dolly. And she's just staggering down the road like she's shouting. And some truck driven. She just went, oh, hey, come over here, come over here. And the car just drove by, whatever. And she walked into me and she. She saw me come in and she saw the beer in my hand. She couldn't believe her luck. And she stopped and she tried to stop me. And I sort of stepped one side step, one way to try and go past her. She stepped there and blocked my way. So she blocked the other way and she went, come here, come here. Like, trying to motion. And I was really scared. It was like some. You looked around and thought, beggars can't be Jesus. But then for a minute I was thinking, well, you know, I mean, it's Friday night. I'm in a mood to make whoopee. But I thought it's probably best to avoid it. And I actually managed to run away and avoid her. And she just kept shouting at me as I was running down the road, come. Come with me. Come with me. But I liked it. But what I was thinking, it was like some kind of. Like, sort of Hansel and Gretel nightmare. Like an old lady in your way. You're going there and there's loads of other people that look just like you. Exactly. They're getting very, very thin. We've been here. Yeah. Yeah. I thought you'd be proud of me. No, there was that. That was, you know, that was a woman on a plate, so to speak, and I just turned it down and. Yeah, exactly. You see, he got in and went, what have I done? Seeing her again tonight? Well, I'm just gonna hang around by the offee, see what happens, you know. Looking forward to Christmas. Loving it. I'm always a big fan of Christmas, actually. And I'm not a bad humbug type. It's not. It's not far now, is it? It's this month now. Are we in December? Is it the first? Yeah. Jeez. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Jeez. Jesus. Brilliant. I was quite excited because this weekend, I think it was this week in the papers, the sun, and I think all the other papers actually had the first of the kind of giveaway tv supplements that comes up listing all the shows that are on. But when they bring about this early, is you open it and it's like. You think, yeah, I want to see what films are on and stuff. And you go through it and it's just. About half of the listings are to be confirmed. To be confirmed. It's absolutely. What? It's an utter waste of time. Yeah. And it's like. But it's like, who is planning their. Filming their film and tv watching this early? Yeah, a little bit early to be. Worrying about three weeks in advance going, I better not make any. Well, unless it's, like an amazing thing on telly. Are you coming to a party? We got one Friday 29th. I don't know. I'm gonna watch something on the tv. It is a good film. What is it not being confirmed yet? It's to be confirmed. I can just, you know, say I won't be at the party. Yeah. It's strange, but I remember when I. Was little, my sister used to work in Wh Smith's and she used to come home, like, every Thursday. She'd been paid big bag of sweets. And, you know, the tv times? The tv times, of course, because you're working class tv times. The Radio times for a class. You're middle class gentleman, myself. But the. The bumper edition at Christmas, it's like two weeks of telly. She sit down that Thursday night, sit down with Miss Sweets, and we tick off all the things we were going to watch over the next series. Didn't happen, did it? Because I, you know, squeaking around, hyperactive, making people playing with toys stuff and not watching telly. Really, I bet you. But if you watched any telly, it would have been really rubbish stuff. The whole family was like, I imagine probably Dennis Norden's laughter file, volume twelve, or whatever it is. I don't think even Dennis Norton was going there. Whereas, you see, we in our house, of course, we'd often not. We'd just switch off the tv and we just listen, you know. Concerto on radio three. Yeah. We weren't allowed to turn the telly off, really. I don't know what a concerto is. I've just said that word, I'm assuming. What a concerto is it. It's like a. Just a posh word for concert, innit? I think so. Is it? It's one of those. Maybe it's one of those instruments. The kind of squeeze box that's a concertina. It's a concertina, yeah. Yeah. My nan used to play a concertina. Really? Yeah. I don't know if that's interesting to you. I don't know why you choose the concertina of all the instruments to play. I mean, it's not the sexiest, only kind of sadistic. My nan used to have one, but she doubled up as an iron lung. Nice. Which was good. And so when she, you know, once you had a bit of an attack, we. Not only we were warned, but we had a little tune. That's beautiful. Did you play your gran? You can play your gran. Yeah. That's beautiful. She had a bit of an accident. She said, sit down, kids. And she came in there and she had a corrugated net where it had gone horribly wrong. Go on. Sorry. What were you gonna say? It happened again. Steve, what's happening? It's going all wrong. We're talking rubbish. Are we? Yeah. We should have played two in a row. He's having a go, isn't he? Limey gorillas rock the house. Yeah. XFM 104.9. Who are you? Ricky Gervais. Who are you? Steve Merchant. Yeah. Nice. Together again. I can't believe it. The old team, they said it never. Plus Carl, he presses the buttons. Draw attention to him. We were talking about squeeze boxes. Yes. And got me to thinking what's happened to them? You don't see them. I mean, instruments should be around forever. You know what I mean? The pianoforte, it's around, you know, the saxophone was only, I think, the twenties or thirties, but, you know, I can't imagine it going away. There's a number of instruments probably dying out. Loot the lute. The loot you rarely see now. You rarely see, except maybe on a men without hats. What was men without hats or marillion. Right. Right. We can dance if we want to. And Pierre Trudeau's daughter was in that video. Who was that we saw in the sandwich shop yesterday? Well, he might not want us. He might want to be people to know that he was in a sandwich shop. It's fine. It just shows that he. Bruce Dickinson. He didn't recognize him. I went, look. Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden. Had no idea. He's really tiny. It was almost laughable. Is he married? That'll annoy me. You've just alienated yourself from a lot of heavy metal fans now, because he's pretty much a guru. They never leave their bedrooms, Rick. Yeah, but they've got powers. If they're putting crystals now on toads. And they're going to turn you into a. All right. Well, no. I stopped myself realizing it wasn't much. Of a threat, Rick. Right. Go on. What else is dying out? Pipes. Pipes. You never see people smoking pipes. Young people now not smoking pipes. No. You see old people, you're right. But kids, you've got to start taking up pipes, otherwise they're going to die out because people of the older generation, they're going to die soon. I'm not smoking a pipe. I should with pipes, though. Was it like the fashion where when you smoked, you started at a young age and then carried on? Or did you just start at 50? But no, because if you see shots of professorial types from the 1930s when they were at Oxbury, they're always smoking pipes in a tweed jacket. Yeah, that was when they started, like, universal. Yeah, but they still do lots of things that should die out in the rest of the world. Carry on in Oxbridge. Yeah, but my point is. All right, all I'm saying is that they're not even in Oxbridge now. They're not even smoking pipes. I bet there is. There's no one smoking pipes. Well, I'd like to know if there's anyone listening who's under the age of 30 that smokes a pipe regularly. And I don't mean like a crack. Pipe and I guarantee they went to Oxford or Cambridge. Okay, what's the number? Oh, 8700 800 1234. What's email? Ricky Gervaisfm dot co dot UK. Pipes are dine out. Snuff. That's as good as gone, yeah? Snuff, yeah. Trilbus, my friend, always said if he won, like, loads of money on the lottery, he'd like to try really hard to try and bring back as a fashion accessory, the cape. Because the capes are classy. I quite like the cape. The cape's brilliant because you can kind of, you know, kind of mask your face with it. Yeah, Dracula. Like, you can have it off, but still on and on, but still off. Exactly like a coat, you know what I mean? Where you drape it over your shoulders and that can fall down. Carl, you're not a fan of the cape. You're turning your nose up with the cape. That's a madness. No pockets. Good point. You can have some kind of inner sort of smuggler's pocket, poacher's pocket. If they did that, I'd buy one. Well, I'll tell you what, that sounds good. It's. That sounds good. It's just gone half ass. It's a new thing. I don't believe it. Sounds good. For a minute, though, I was completely lost. Remind me again, what's that? Sounds good. It's that film. Sound good? Oh, yeah, that film sounds good. Right. This is. This is my famous film review, which I've got coming up. Look forward to that. It's brilliant. Yes, it's. It's quite a delicate subject, but I think I deal with it sensitively. This is that film. Sounds good. Right. And I'll tell you, remind us again what that is. What this? Well, it's. I'm gonna pick a song from a film. Okay. From the soundtrack. Right. I'm choosing a song from Jackie Brown. Okay. Great film. Yeah. Brilliant film. And this is across 110th street by Bobby Womack. It's fantastic. Wonderful song. You'll only like this if you're really cool. Yeah, if you're really cool, like, say, us. Yeah. I was the third brother of five doing whatever I had to do to survive I'm not saying what I did was alright trying to break out of the ghetto was a day to day fight being down so long getting up didn't cross my mind but I knew there was a better way of life and I was just trying to find you don't know what you do till you put under pressure across 110th street is a hell of a tester across 110ft pimps trying to catch a woman that's weep 110 speed pushes won't let the junk go free. Woman trying to catch a trick on the street. You can find it all in the street. I got one more thing I'd like to talk to y'all about right now. Hey, brother, there's a better way out. Shooting that coat, shooting that dope man you're copping out. Take my advice and see the liver die. You got to be strong if you want to survive the family on the other side of town but catch hell without a ghetto around. In every city you'll find the same thing going down. Harlem is the capital of every ghetto town. He'll be singing across a 110 pimps trying to catch a woman. That's me. Can you see? Yes, you can look around and look around and look around and look around you yeah. Oh, yeah. Bobby Womack across 110th street. It's great, isn't it? That's a lovely feature. And that was. That's the first feature. Oh, that film sounds good. Brilliant. Yeah, yeah. I'm thinking of actually bringing out maybe a compilation of. I'd love to hear it. Song for the lovers. What sort of things can we hear, can we expect in the future? I know you're a big fan. This is brilliant. He bought, right, the soundtrack to the film Braveheart, which is just kind of. No, let me just explain. Which is just kind of big orchestrated numbers. Right, James, as far as he's concerned, that's classical music. He's got a classical music CD in his collection. It's the music from Braveheart. Oh, I sit there and I think, yeah, I'd probably sort of lead my people's. He's obsessed with Braveheart. He actually sort of relates to William Wallace. He actually thinks. Yeah, that's the sort of thing I'd be doing. Yeah, it is. What was it you were working out to the other day as well? You know, he's got like a personal, like, gymnast or whatever. It's. What's it called? He's a gym. Gym expert. A trainer. You've got a personal. I box with this bloke. Yeah. He goes boxing in like some underpass somewhere. Right. Every day, like, every single day he goes boxing. Right, timer you were training to this week. What music did you have on? Oh, my God. I have actually. Now, I never did this, but I have actually gone red, haven't I? Yes. Right. It's very hard to embarrass. I was working out and training and boxing. Oh, my God. You're gonna have to play a record after this. To the rocky soundtrack. To the rocky soundtrack he's bought, right. A CD which has got the best music from all of them. Now, was it eye of the tiger. Or was it with eye of tiger? Then it goes hearts on fire. That's me. So then it goes, dun dun dun dun dun dun. Does any of your training with your trainer? Does it ever involve you running through snow with a log chained to your back like in rocky hills? I was often after help russian peasants because their cart horse has, like, fallen over. But I lift it up. Whereas the other fella, he's training in a posh gym having injections. I'm not. I'm just like, breaking rocks and punching dead cows. Where'd you get that from? It's handy, wasn't it? Put it on. What is it? He can't hear because he's got his. Put your headphones on. Why? It was. You'll love it. You'll love it. Yeah. That's magnificent. That's now Ricky Gervais's theme tune. Yeah. Every time we start the show. We should just start with that. Win, Ricky, win. You two, walk on. I've got to give it to him. Hated you two for about 15 years. I know, I know. But I love that one now. I just love that album. They can't put a foot wrong. Do you ever listen to the whole album? Because I know you tend to buy albums just for the singles, when you could. Of course, just buy the singles. I know where he's going. I bought light, funky ones. Oh, I wanted to say that. Yeah, I bought light, funky ones because. I like funky ones. Do you remember the light, funky ones? That was about like a year ago. What did they do? They did girl in a green dress, girl on tv. That one, yes. Summertime, Abercrombie and Fitch. The girls are wearing up. Drummer. That is like a light sort of summer. Listen. Nonsense. I've got a lot of money. It's nothing to me. Okay, the light. I want a bit of light funky ones once. That's 15 quid. It's nothing to me. He put the two singles on, right? Never listen to rest the album. I never listen to the two singles. The light, funky ones. Oh, it's just my street creds gone down it. Rocky soundtrack and the light, funky ones. You'd make two mistakes. Let's not forget Braveheart. The soundtrack. Oh, yeah. It's a good film. We were talking earlier about story about. A little australian freed, the Scottish, the. Stuff that's dying out that we, I think you and I single handedly need to kind of resurrect and salvage. I thought the trilby was dying out. Yeah. I surprised you. And yet watching top of the pops last night. Yeah. Jimmy require was wearing one and then lo and behold, Danny Mino came on. She had one as well. I thought, blimey, there's two people there trying to salvage the trill being good. Really. Well, that's on its way, then. That. Let them. The trilogy's fine, let's do some out. But the bowler hat. Ah, the bowler hat. You never see the bowler hat. I never fancy myself in the bowler. I love a bowler hat. Carl, would you wear a bowler hat? I know you'd wear the cape. I did wear a trilby. You really. You must have looked like a. That's brilliant. What, because you're a Mancunian? Well, there was a phase one thing in about 90. When was it? I think that was just round your way. It might have been. It was in Manchester. Did someone get a job? Lot of Trillbiz. And persuades you kids. Yeah. I tell you what's trendy. No. You know, now, Sean Riderwe has one of these. Does he? Yeah. Yeah. Go on. Yeah. Quid. And everyone in your street had trilbies on. But you've never worn a bowler. Never. What about Kangal bowler? You might think again. I'll tell you what, I would like to wear a bowler hat in a dark. But I'm worried I look like one of those little fellows off the home pride advert. The home pride guys. They've been persevering with the bowler for years. They still look good in it, though. They're still looking good. They're dapper guys. Yeah. There's a lot of. The jolly green giant. He had quite a distinctive look, which is obviously one I've been thinking of exploiting. What, the little one? Oh, I know the little one. Like a little dress. Corn crop made up his little skirt. Yeah. What was the jolly green giant so jolly about? Probably very pleased. It kind of just been the sweet corn in the peas. No, I reckon it was his enormous jolly green knoll. I mean, he must have got up every day and gone, look at that. He must have been so happy. The only thing that's like in the case of the jolly green giant, or like when Gulliver was a giant and he was in Lilliput and all the Lilliputians, they helped him out. They were feeding him and stuff. Yeah. If you're a giant like that. In that situation, how do sort of have a little sneaky tug, you know, a little tug, a little J. Arthur rank? I don't know. Because it's like. It's very tricky to do. As big as their mountains. You can't hide. They go, oh, you know, I mean, there's no. There's no. Little village. Probably just thought it was a tidal wave or something. That's pretty grim, though. Yeah. Tidal wave is pretty desperate. I know, it's. How would he have gone to the mayor and said, I need. I need a kleenex the size of a tennis court. Yeah. And a gigantic copy of the Daily Star. I never understood with giants how they actually got that big in the first place. Because what food was around to make them. Because not only were they, like, big big, but they were mostly big. They ate well. They ate whole cows. Probably not well documented, Carl. You know. You know, they don't actually exist and never have. Okay. Right. It's time for a feature, I think, Carl, I've got. There was a tv show I watched once on the History Channel. This is the History Channel. Yeah, it was the history of werewolves. Right. The history of werewolves. And the whole show is predicated on the fact that at the end we'll tell you if they ever existed or not. Yeah, just waiting. I go, come on, we're gonna be late. Hold on, he's gonna tell us. Existed or not, Carl, werewolves. Michael Aspel was in it. And Michael Aspel is a top broadcaster and therefore would not associate himself with something that did not exist. Under the covers. Time, gents. Under the covers. Cover me up. Cover me bad, run for cover. Here come the covers. Yeah, covers. I like cover songs. This is a cover version? Yes. This is from an album which is a bit hit and miss, as these things often are. It's different artists covering the songs of Leonard Cohen. You've got the pixies on there, Rem Nick Cave, different people. This, bizarrely, is Lloyd Cole, not someone I'm normally a fan of, but doing a version of the fantastic Leonard Cohen song at Chelsea Hotel. Play it, Cole. It's beautiful. Chelsea Hotel. You're talking so loud and so sweet. You were giving me a hair. Although I may be while the limousines wait in the street. And those were the reasons that was New York. We were running for the money and the flesh. That was called love for the workers in song. Probably still is for those who've been left. And then you got away and now didn't you, babe? You just turned your back on the crowd. Yeah. You got away. I never once heard you say I need you I don't need you, I need you, I don't need you. And all of that driving around. I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel. You're famous. Your heart was a legend. You told me again that you preferred a handsome man. If I knew you would make an exception. And clenching your fists for the ones like us who are oppressed, I figured beauty. Yeah. Fixed yourself, you said. Well, never mind. We are ugly, but we have the music. Many. You got away now, didn't you, babe? You just turned your back on the crowd. Oh, you got a way. I never once heard you say I need you I don't need you, baby, baby, I need you? I don't need you. And all of that jiving around? You got a way. I never once heard you say I need you I don't need ya, baby, I need you? I don't need you. And all of that driving around. I don't mean to suggest I loved you the best. Can't keep track of each fallen robin I remember you well in the Chelsea hotel. I don't think of you that often. Lloyd Cole doing his version of Chelsea Hotel. Under the covers. Under the covers. Oh, it was a beautiful version. It's lovely, apparently. I think it's that song, sweet, written. By Leonard Cohen originally, and I think it's about his brief romance with Nico, who made a name, of course, with the velvet underground and was a tragic drugs victim. But it's interesting because I'm looking at this as a compilation called I'm your fan, which is cover songs of Leonard Cohen's music. And as I say, rem, there's people on the Nick Cave who are still going. There's a couple of names you don't tend to hear of that often. Now, the house of love. Oh, yeah. Rarely hear them, do you? Um. That petrol emotion. Oh, yeah, that petrol emotion, yeah. Who else we got on here? It says Robert Forster. Now, is he a musician or is it. I don't. Robert Forster. What if you know who Robert Forster is? I thought he was a writer. The lilac time. The lilac time. They're on there as well. Can I just say a name around and laugh? It's the lilac type. Wow. We were. Did I tell you before that my friend and I once listed words we thought should be rude, but aren't, like cassock. We always talk. Yeah. And. And he always pointed out the blow monkeys. Yeah. Which I was like. But isn't it. Isn't that could be a new feature, couldn't it? We're featured up, aren't we? Aren't we? This is brilliant. We've still got the film review to come. Song for lovers is coming up in a few minutes. Song for the ladies. Yeah. Song for the ladies. If I can squeeze in a hip hop track, I'd love to do it. Yeah, that's. That's called our hip hop track bit. Yeah, exactly. Oh, it's just. It's just amazing. Do you have a classic song, rick? What? What were you thinking of? Oh, I don't know. Maybe something by nirvana. Well, there's. There's. Well, their biggest classic. You mean, ideally? Smells like teen spirit. It's going well, isn't it? I'm enjoying it. I'm enjoying it. Well, I'm looking forward to pop idol. Pop idol? I've not been watching it. You're joking. I don't know what's happened, really. I've lost interest. Oh, well, it is like most things that the. The preliminary rounds always when all the real freaks and no hopers, you know, but some of. Sometimes I watch those sort of things and I sort of laugh and I think, oh, dear, I shouldn't be laughing because he's not just rubbish, he's verging on the mentally ill. I mean, some of these people go along. You want to go. Who told you to go along? What were you thinking? Right, well, it's the fact that there. Was no one to stop them going. That's what's even more terrifying. I know. And Simon Cowell's good. Oh, he's great value. He's amazing. Foxy. I like foxy. Now, I know I've warmed two. He's come round, Doctor Foxy. Lovely little shiny tree. Now, often I notice he's not always there week on week and week. Is that because he's off doing medical operations? He's got his practice. Practice. Got to maintain that. Yeah. And, you know, it's the big one tonight. I mean, when I say the big one. Capital radio. He's still on capital radio. Yeah, he's got to do so. You know, isn't it some of the big names, though? It's Darius Dinesh tonight. It's Darius in the fat boy and the fat guy thing that makes you. I noticed in the sun today is saying, vote for me because of my musical talent, not because I'm huge and you feel sorry for me. Yeah. Well, that's good. I think that's right. But he's good. He has got a great Darius. I noticed he shaved his beard off. He looks. He's a new man. He looks slightly laughable, though. He's got quite a weak chin. He's having a laugh. Well, he's dissing Darius. I'm not claiming to be a pop star. Wow. Oh. Can you feel the love in the room? Yeah. Let's have a little song. No, but I'm looking forward to it. My favorite all the way through has been the little fella with the stutter I'd like Darius to get. Yeah, I think it's almost certain he's gonna win. All that welsh girl was very good. The one that made Pete Waterman cry. Yeah, that was great. Smells good, though, wasn't she? Yes, they're great. They're really good. But, you know, it'd be nice to see fatty get some. I mean, he's just a weird shape, though. It's. It turns my stomach. And I'm one to talk. No, I know. He's just, you know, he's just doing his job. It's, you know, glandular. Yeah. It's not his greed, but, you know, he's got a good voice. And why not? We've. Good luck to him. We've had Demis Russos in the charts. Yeah. Alison Moyer. There's not been a fatty for a while. I say, who's been a big star? I mean, Moye may would have been the last one. Gerry Watson. She sorted herself out after becoming famous. She was pretty big, wasn't she? Who, Jerry Halliwell. Yeah. She was never a bloater. Have you seen those bloke off pop idols? It's like he's got three Jerry Hallowell strapped to his waist and then wearing a big coat over the top to smuggle them in. Yeah, exactly. To a no Halliwell zone. Reckon he's. I see what he's gonna do. I reckon he's gonna take it off and he's just a big fan for. And it was like to prove, you know, the prejudice of the world. Yeah, all right. Yes. Hey, and how come that little fellow with a starter doesn't start when he's singing? Hold on, hold on. That's cleaned up. Actually, she's not even Welsh. Exactly. The various. Apparently, Darius is not a knob. Dandy Warhols on XFM 104.9 Back 02:20. The Ricky Gervais show with Steve Merchant. Yeah, he's still here. The Christmas ads have come on. I notice they're on now. And I noticed. I was watching last night, watching. Tell you last night. And do you think that the advertising executive for Cadbury's Roses chocolates just comes in once a year and they go, what you got this year? And he goes, what about some workmen and some old ladies singing? Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. A shot in a street somewhere. Yeah, that'd be fine. It worked last year. Yeah. That's been going like, since I can remember. I've never seen another advert for Cadbury's roses. Except that. Exactly. There's certain things that conjure up Christmas, like you've got your turkey and all that. You got your roses. Yeah. Woolworths. Walrus. Yeah. Oh, dear. Pizza. Pizza. Woolworths. Drink driving. Oh, dear. Sorry, I forgot what I went in for. What are we doing? We were doing some things. Be careful. There's a lot of money involved here, Steve. Don't stitch me up. Did you. I was reading the paper this week, that Charlotte church. Yeah. You know, little kind of singing sensation, she's been slagging off the firemen who've been salvaging people and. No, but I saw the news. I saw on the news that she stood, apparently, and she claimed that she'd be misinterpreted. Right. But the Channel five news thought this was a big enough story to say that Charlotte church had been saying that the September 11 tragedy had been blown out of proportion. Right. She's been just lagging off the firemen. No, but that's what they said. They said that she felt that they were being held as kind of heroes and they were just doing their job. Right. Oh, that is. That's. Yeah, that's a little bit stupid to say, anyway. A little bit insensitive and. Yeah, yeah. Because it's like. Did you read about. Why do you care? Why does anyone care who she thinks about September anyway? It's time. Those things, like during a presidential election or when I'm accidents, it's these things I. Preacher Billy Piper says I've always voted labor. Who's gonna go? War. Hold on, hold on. Thanks. From steps. He's a conservative. What's going on? I don't know if he is or not. You know, that was just an example. I don't think. I don't know what either of them vote, to be honest. All right, let's not get into it. I think Faye and Claire from steps are both BMP members. I can't. I remember reading that somewhere. That's true. That's so untrue. He takes that back now. I cannot be certain. I think that's definitely untrue. I read it on the net, and it's often wrong on the net, right? Definitely. Definitely. He's going to retract that now. Definitely. Yeah. What I'm saying. I'm saying it's almost certainly untrue. I read it on the net. All right. Yeah. And those things are always untrue. Okay. All right. It's diss the net now. You dis the net. I can't believe it. Did you dig ourselves out of this hole now? Well, blue, now, I definitely can quote this because I read it in the sun. Yeah. Blue were being interviewed by, you know, blue, the pop band Blue all rise. Have you bought that album yet, Rick? I imagine that would be on your. I like it. One for the money and the free run. Anyway, Blue were being interviewed by the sun for when they were on web chats by the lovable Dominic Mohan. And for some reason, they got September 11. And one of the members of Blue said, again, church, like. I thought, he's been blown out of all proportion. What about all the whales and elephants that are dying every day? And the other band were going, shut up. Yeah, it was funny. They gave me a transcript of it going, shut up. They had to do a retraction. He said, sorry, I didn't know. Yeah. He said, obviously, I'm very passionate about whales and elephants. And perhaps a bit misplaced. All the proceeds that I'll receive from our next single, I'm gonna give to the September 11 foundation. Yeah. And then he went, can I give some to the whales now you've done it again. Don't worry about the whales. But this is what I mean. Why are people not asking the members of blue, yeah. You know, or atomic kitten, what they think about September 11? I know. They should just be working in a chippy, those people. They're lucky to be on the telly. Except that the atomic kitten girls. Really? I mean, do they not look like they should be in a chip shop or just hanging around outside an offee drinking diamond wine? Will be soon. They will be soon. Don't worry. Although hearsay's new single. I dissed hearsay before, but they've come out with a, you know, little poppy thing. I think I surprised you, Rick. I got her liberty. I prefer liberty as well. A little bit funky with kids. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, XFN 104.9. Once again, our opinions on current pop bands. If you'd like to have your hold on, though. Go on. Shoot. Isn't it about time for, you know, a hip hop track? Have we got it? Can you do song for the lovers would be good. Oh, I'll do that. Now the song for the. Now. This is a beautiful song. It's by Simon Agarth, uncle. It's only 1 minute 49 long. It's. It's called April come she will it's the song for the lovers. Play it, Rick. April. Come she will. When streams are. Ripe and swelled with rain May she will stay resting in my arms again June she'll change her tune in restless walks she'll probably july she will fly and give no warning to her flight August die she must when winds blow chilly and cold September I remember a loved one snoo has now grown old. April comes she will so isn't that beautiful? Beautiful little song. See, I quite like to put out a compilation like song for the lovers maybe, you know what I mean? But I'm worried, obviously the title's ironic. We're taking the mickey out of those things. But quite serious about all the songs we play. Yeah, exactly. I'm worried about people perceive it a bit like Simon Bates r tune album or something. Steve Wright's Sunday love songs. Yeah, yeah, but. Yeah, when you think that you listen to some dance track, you buy it and it's like five minutes long. The same thing, repetitive beats. Yeah. And then you hear that a minute and a half. Classic. Do you know what I mean? Hey, have I made my point, Rick? I think so, yeah. If anyone knows what my point was there. He's giving phone in and he's made it. Well, yeah. Carl, have you got some off you got lined up for us? Some. Remember strokes on XFM 104.93 Gervaise show with me, Steve Merchant, Kyle Pilkington, the Cayman. Well, it's time for that. Well, I think people wait for this now, I never knew really, since I was doing the show that I actually had a bit of a knack for film reviews. Right. You know, I mean, because. Yeah, I'll probably, probably be asked soon by Barry Norman or Jonathan Ross to do some on that sort of thing. Or maybe my own film. So I don't know, tv or the clock sticking. It's only matter time. Yeah. Okay, this week I've chosen. Well, wait a minute, let's play the jingle. Okay? The film review and that. Yeah, yeah. Okay, here we go. This week I've chosen my left foot, right? Okay. Now, my left foot is a film about a bloke called Daniel Day Lewis who's all mental except for his left foot. Right, but. And he has arguments. I can't remember. He has argument with his dad somewhere. I wasn't watching it properly but he. Even though he's mental apart from the foot he does stuff with the foot that we could. We're not, you know, could do all over and he uses that to his best. I think he might write a book or something off paint. And the moral of this story is, you know, even if you're. You've only got a foot that works you can still win prizes because it won the Oscar. Okay. Am I right in saying that you're bringing in a book out of these collected maybe for the Christmas market? I think I might, yeah. Yeah. I see there's always reviewed sort of what with it's a different. It's a different outlook on it, a different approach. I don't just sort of like stray. Well, I'll tell you what, it's an approach that doesn't really use grammar which, which you don't see that often in film reviews. But no, once again what would you give it out of ten? As I said, I didn't really conserve it. I can't remember a lot about it but it won an Oscar so I think it won an Oscar summer so nine. Okay. That was my left foot which probably available on sell through video maybe in a bargain bin. 599 probably on tv this Christmas that's to be confirmed. Eels fresh feeding on XFM 104 point I was going well in it. I'm enjoying it. Yeah. I mean it's to go, I think, you know, more shows that we've made some great hits and great songs. We've got some great features, a new feature. That film sounds good. Looking forward to that. I've run and run song for those. Any record companies out there? The one I put out compilation. So my songs for lovers. Yeah. That's good. Anyone who wants me to do a film, anything. Any film you want. Yeah. Reviewed yet? Reviewed, yeah, I finished a sentence. Yeah. No, ideally because it was otherwise it was anyone who wants me to do a film, of course being a top actor, you'd have. Sure, okay. Yeah. And that. You'Re running out of steam. I can rain now. Yeah. Yeah. Go on, Carl. Have you seen it yet? I know you probably haven't. Rick. Cliff Richards video for his new single. Yep. It's amazing, isn't it? I saw it on Lorraine Kelly in the morning sky. One great show and. And it's amazing. It's. It's. He's done a version of somewhere over the rainbow but he's combined that. He's combined that with. Was it. It's oh, what a beau what a wonderful world. I wasn't really listening. I was looking at the pictures. It's what a wonderful world and combined with some over the rainbow. So he's done two classic songs, two songs that have been done definitively. Yeah. Artists in the past. He's trying to combine with a kind of Yamaha keyboard sound of the Mac. What was his last year's one? It was prayer with over old langs. He's just obsessed with combining two songs. Like they're not good enough as they are people to get bored. We better combine them. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a megamix. Like a cliff megamix. And he's right. The video is unbelievable. It's him flying through. It's all kind of sort of 2d animation, kind of almost sort of a collage of buildings and high rise flats and that. Kids see him floating by, they wave, they point to each other. They can't believe. They're like, there goes Sir Cliff. They're going, who's that? He was around in the fifties, and. He'S just got a little one dimensional cliff with a kind of angelic glow flying through the sky, just bringing happiness to people as he sings. Oh, he does his real face kind of every so often, kind of appearing. And wonder where his real face is. And it's. It's one of the worst songs and one of the worst videos I've ever seen. I mean, I know people slag off Cliff and it's an easy target, but he actually deserves it because he's shameful. Yeah, he's embarrassing. Yeah, embarrassing. I mean, arrogant. Well, everything's a disguised boast. I mean, I know I like devil woman. I like Miss Unites. I liked wired for sound and I like talk speakers and small speaker. You know, I like all size of speakers. You know that. You'll vouch me on that? Yeah. And he sang about it, which is good. And, you know, I'm often wired for sound. Right. Carrie doesn't live her anymore where she can't. She's just another message on the payphone wall. It's a story. But lately I haven't had a lot of time for him. Awful. I remember he was on something, on one chat show, and I think was Des or Michael asked for something and I said, so you had something? He said, yeah. He said, well, everyone knows that Elvis sold more records after his death than when he was alive. Little dig there against Elvis. Well, I've just overtaken his record for sales in the UK. Right? So he sets up that Elvis is only selling because he's dead. And anyway, I've still beaten him in the UK. Yeah, yeah. And where'd you get. And where'd you get the quiff from? And the way to sing, where'd you get that from? Cliff? What did you think of that? Those people. He's just desperate for the credibility that he's never going to have. I like it when he went around last year going, they're not playing my record. They're not playing my record. They're not playing. Oh, go on, play it. Number one. Yeah. Ha. Food. It was number one. The Millennium prayer. I know. Yeah, well, it was, you know, was the millennium, wasn't it? It was, but I don't know who's buying it. I mean, I know you seem to claim it's some kind of like 60 year old women, but they're not really a commercial force now. Yes, car seems to know that. Well, like, when you're born, you're a little baby, wrinkly and stuff. When you get older, you sort of morph into a baby again and you go through the same phases. So when you're young, you buy singles, you get old, you got nothing to do all day, you got all your pension money. What will I buy? Cliff Richards on the telly. Here's my video buy me song. You see, that started off as quite a sensible point, because I actually think I do it. But what was all that alien stuff about when you're born, you go wrinkly and you go wrinkly against. Sometimes you mix like normal things that human beings say with I don't know what. Well, look, when you're a baby, you've got a little bald head, no teeth, you get old, what happens? Are you a philosopher? You're an official philosopher because, I mean, it sounds like it. Oh, Carl, play a record. You're a gem. You're a diamond. XFM 104.9. Good to hear the happy Mondays again. We're nearly through. We are indeed. We've had a little bit of chat, we've had a few laughs, we had a few tears. We have indeed. We've introduced a new feature. Looking forward to that next week. Yeah. So it's just gonna be wall to wall features, isn't it? It's gonna be. Ah, well, I had an idea for feature, which you didn't seem to like, which was something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue. Explain it. And. Yeah, something old. An old song. Something new. A new song. Yeah, something borrowed. A cover version. Yeah, and something blue. Just a melancholy and beautiful song. Right, okay. But does it have to be all four or can it be anyone? No, it's all for you. Play that over the course of the show. Or maybe just have a set. Four songs in a row and that's that section. So. So that, so, like, feature would be like, this is either an old song or a new song. Yeah, that's good. I think we've done that a few times. No, it's not. It's not. We've covered that. Well, what's the difference? Playing. Oh, I'm playing a song from a film. Just because you give it a title. It's just a song from a freak anyway. Couldn't you? Brilliant. It's all nonsense, you see. Cheers, Karl. Yeah, my ideas are good, aren't they? Because they're not only sort of accessible, but there's a little bit of depth there. I think it's fair enough to let him have his little feature at the end of the show though. Just, you know, give him happy. This song for the lovers. Excellent. Well, that's. Yeah, but that's not till after song two by. I remember the days when Carl didn't even want to be on the air. I remember the days when he wasn't. He was told by the establishment that he wasn't allowed to talk on the air. And now it's like he's. As far as he's concerned, he's a third member of the team. He's protected by me. Right. Yeah. Cheers. Song to you by Blur. We're running out of time. It's five two. Just got time for Steve's song for the ladies. Wedding present. Rick from the album Saturday. I think it's pronounced like that. And it's track three, dream world. Looking forward to ladies. Goodbye. I don't know how many times I tried to wonder. How many times I've heard you laugh and say underneath it all he's okay. How many times rang and sworn you'd give me one last chance and he'd let you down but then he called and you'd go back round. You know I still care because you only have to for me and I'll be over that. Why can't we see this one? All because of him. Well, of course it is. And I hate to see. Just wonder. Just because it's not what you'd like to hear. You ask me everything you know. I still can. Because you only have to phone me and I'll be over that. Lick your words. No, I always think it for you. You say you feel left out. I know exactly how. Just can't go on pretending, you just can't go on pretending, you just can't go on pretending, you just can't go on pretending, you just can't go on pretending, you just can't go on pretending, you just can't go on pretending, you just can't go on pretending. I'm on my way right over that lick your words, you know you make me want to shout, you say fell right down but you are a better dream world. Online XFm dot co dot UK. This is XFM. XFM.",
