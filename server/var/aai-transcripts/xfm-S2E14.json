  "text": "Red hot chili peppers on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant, Kyle Pilkington. All right, don't be nervous. We might see a difference in car. He's a little bit shy. There's someone here from ABC filming this part of that celebrity boxing thing, the fight, I think it's called in there. They want to get a little clip of this. So we're gonna let them film for a minute and then they're gonna go away. Is that all right, Karl? Yeah, he doesn't want to. He doesn't want to be on camera. Do you? Do you? I think it ruins radio, don't it. For the people listening? It doesn't. Yeah, but he does because people are like, oh, he sounds like a bit of a looker. What do you do? Yeah. And then they'll see it on the telly and I'll go, God, yeri. You know, his head is round, though, in it. Guess what? I got a call yesterday. You'll love this. Steve from MTV and wondering if I'm. They could screen test Carl. That's outrageous. I'm loving it. And I was going, yeah. And I come, I said, yeah, yeah, he's trying. I come down with him and I was saying, what about this now I love. And I called him. I went, oh, no. I went, why not? He went, well, I'm looking at my reflection now in the mirror. He said I shouldn't be on the telly. What would you wear for your screen test car? What kind of look would you try and cultivate? Because you've got to bear in mind that the audience out there, they don't know what you look like. So would you be a snappy dresser, like, say, Jonathan Ross? Or would you go for your kind of look? A suit? Don't. You can't wear a suit. Don't hold it well. So I'm thinking, I don't know. I'll probably wear me woolly hat because that takes some years off me. He does. He looks about ten with a woolly hat on. Yeah. Okay. Is it quite a cool woolly hat or is it got a bubble charcoal? I'd say it's the in cola. I probably wear me on a rack. Right? He's going for quite a glam look. Oh, dressed for a jumble sale. Wow. Yeah. I'm not that happy about it all, to be honest. Yeah. Are you gonna do it? You're not gonna do it? Well, I'm sort of stuck in the middle because throughout my life so far, I've always just. I've never planned for anything. Right. It's just always happened. Yeah, yeah. The time, you know, I mean, being in plays at school never planned it, but when I did it, I went down the store. So we, as I remember, you did little donkey. Did a little donkey, yeah. And then later someone was filming at the back. Was it your dad's mate? My dad's mate, yeah. And on the camcorder he listened about watching, playing it. His dad says, just off camera. What does he say? I don't want to say it because I'm in charge of the show and be irresponsible. He looks like a right twat. And so he gets over watching that and then here's his dad, just off camera, go. He looks like a right twat. What, you worried about your dad? Can I just interject? Because I'm really worried about this idea of Carl being on MTV. Because the problem is that, you know, let's be honest, Rick. I mean, we're. We're getting by the skin of our teeth, aren't we? Really? It's only Carl that's keeping this afloat. Yeah. And if he gets on MTV and the world sort of gets a sense of. And they understand him and he won't be ours anymore, we won't be able to control him. It'll be out there being the thing. No, that's the thing. That's the terrible thing, though, isn't it? It's like, carl is my pet, but I realize I've got to release him into the wilderness. And, you know, because I love him, I know he's got to go free. Sure. Maybe someone beat him to death and. We won't have to worry. I'll have you on, though. I'll have you on as a guest, which gets me on to something we've got coming up today. Oh, yeah. He's got a new idea. Yeah. Right. Do you know, like, I've talked about ghosts and we had that good discussion the other week, walking to the circus station. Yeah. And I was telling you about ghosts and you were saying, carl, don't be an idiot and all that. Spoke to a woman in the week. Done a little interview done a little interview done of you, two minutes or so with, with a woman who's, who's got ghosts in her house. So I look forward to hearing that later. That sounds great. Well, I'm going to play a classic tune now. I've just gone straight forward. I've gone for the jugular. This is Ziggy Stardust by David Bowie, Ziggy Stardust by David and XFM 104.9 Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl's also nervous. Quite a bit of shock last week, didn't you? Just a little bit. Is his dad tuned in to the show? Yeah. And Carl's never told him that he actually speaks on the show. He said, I just pressed the buttons. Right. He's kept him from it. You see radio before and you never told him, did you? It's because the little donkey incident. Yeah. When he went on without the twenties. Yeah. Yeah. And so he's never told them since. But they promised not to listen, haven't they? Well, my dad said, my mom said to me, don't worry, don't be put off this week because, you know, I've told him he can't listen. But I hear my dad in the background kind of going, oh, looks so he might be listening. So that's extra pressure. Camera crew in. I know you don't like it. This is good training for MTV because then he can watch you on tv. I mean, what's he gonna make of that? Oh, yeah. Does he know you're bald? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't keep you out on when you're with him and say, oh, no, I'll just press the buttons. It's just. It's just, you know, it's like when. When I was in any plays, I didn't tell him any sort of parents evening. I never gave him the note. Really? What did the teachers think you were just an orphan? No, just on an off chance. My mate's dad spoke to me dad once, I think, and sort of said, oh, you go to school to see how you know your kid's doing what you're talking about. There's a parent's evening. So he did one kid, he went to one. And that's when misses Matthews said, I'd never be a high flyer. How wrong was she? I think we should call misses Matthews and make her eat her words. Well, ah, she had turned on to MTV. When. I don't know that. Like, they're. They're slamming session. Yeah. And they're going, that's young Pilkington. He's bald, but it's definitely him. I recognize that. Willie Hath. Yeah. Did you see celebrity fit club yesterday? I missed it. I didn't watch any tv this week. The only what tv I watched was, are you good in bed? I already knew the answer. Was it you had to have to tick points? Yeah. Yeah, right. It was no, I was off the scale. Well, talking off the scales. Rick Waller, really? Well, what he did is he lost. He lost weight and they couldn't believe it. And he had a big argument with Harvey and they said, go. Never come back to it. Right. And then he got to Wayne and he lost sort of like ten pounds or something. And they were really. They said, you've been starving yourself on. Yeah. And he admitted it and he just. Wasn'T wearing his underpants. Yeah, yeah. But it was whinging all the time. He was doing the press. It was going over at me arm. There's going. I feel sick, there's going. And he was just lying all the time about whether he was doing the routine and what about what he was eating and stuff? And I thought, that's me. It is, because it's sort of like. And they go, how's it going? Do you have another drink this week? I'm gonna go, no, haven't had a beer this week. No. Did you do the exercise day? And I go, yeah, yeah, I've done all that. Done all that, done all that. And I try and get out the sparring because it hurts, because there's a man hitting me in the face for fun. Because, you know, that's what boxing is. I like all the bits except the being here. I don't even mind hitting someone. Right. I'd be willing to hit someone. It's the getting hit that I don't like. Because I know you're a big fan of, like, wearing the clothes, the sort of sporty gear. You look good and you've obviously switched. But they've given out free of charge that this was free. That's a perk you love. And I know you like kind of the sort of various, sort of nutritional drinks you've got. You're big fan of those. I love the protein shake because it tastes like chocolate. You know what? I've put on a couple of pounds since I've been doing this training. I think it is the extra meal. And so you're adding the protein but not enough to take off again. Yeah, but I think I've. I have actually changed a bit. I've got an inch on my chest, but inch off my waist. So even though I've put on weight, there must be a little bit of muscle happening. So I just to recap there slightly, you're enjoying all the trappings of boxing. Yeah, but not the boxing. Not the getting hit in the nose right now. And you are aware that that's what will, what will be happening during the. Actual fight because I've got a cunning plan. Okay, I'm gonna duck and die. Yeah. I'm Bob and weave. Just dance. I'm gonna dance. Well, I read in the paper, yes. I don't know how much truth there is that Grant Bovee has recruited celebrity hypnotist Paul McKenna to help him win. Yeah. So I don't know if that's a finisher because I know you've got, haven't you got burnt? You've got spit, the dog, a couple of ventriloquists and the impressionist on your side. I've got pork five from Desmond. Exactly. Just getting me cheering your corner mentally. Yeah. Well, I don't know. It's all a bit of fun. What do you reckon, Carl? Do you think he's, what's McKenna going to be doing? Is like Grant Bovey going to be turning to a chicken and he's gonna. Do an Elvis impression and take, if. I say the right words. No, I think it's probably, he's probably gonna just help us. Yeah. I think there's lots of sports psychologists out there at the moment getting people. So I'm sure it's, I'm sure it's valid. If it's true. I'm sure it's fine. But I've been, I've been, I've been getting tuned mentally, learning how to hit. Yeah, that was my method. Eating and hitting, I think is. And do you work out to any music? I mean, do you put on the rocky soundtrack? Because I know you've got CD with all, with music from the all five films, haven't you? No, we don't. It's all. I think they have the radio on down there, but you don't hear it. All you hear is people shouting, saying things like, that's not like a fighter. And me going, I'm not a fighter, I'm a comedian. And is it quite intimidating down there? I mean, do they. Yeah, I'm sure they might use to. It now, but it is a different world and I was quite scared and I didn't. When you say, I mean, is it like, is it like they're gangsters? I mean, is it kind of that feel, you know, when you see it in films, they walk into those places and, you know, they're kind of their hard nuts and there's that feel like. Well, you know, they're all x boxes and stuff, so. Yeah, I mean, but no, they're not. That's not, that's not. I mean, I suppose it's like they're real men. Well, yeah. And that they, they don't understand, really, that I'm, I don't like getting hit on the nose. They say, well, no one gets hit on the nose. And it took me a long time to get over that. Just, just taking a couple of punches I wanted to rule out and. But, you know, it's okay now. And of course, they're, I know they're Molly coddling me. They're not using about 25% power. Yeah. And I'm still. And you wear the headgear, do you? Oh, yeah, yeah. And the gum shield. Yeah. I wanted to wear a crash helmet, but they said no and carry a baseball bat. And they said, that's, that's technically illegal, but, um, I'm looking for. I'm a changed man. Carl, what we got coming up? Got a bit of a death in Vegas with vocals from Liam Gallagher. Final question for you, Rick. Do you think you'll carry on boxing after this is finished? Competitively? No, no, just the training and stuff. I do training, yeah. I love that. I love the training. I love learning that, the skills. And I do enjoy the training. I don't, I don't relish getting punched around. And I'm not worried about the fight at all. I'm really looking forward to the fight because Grant's a novice like me. It's just when you get in with an ex pro, you know, could destroy you any, so you're scared to, you know, they never lose their rag and they're really cool and they're really nice and they've never, they've never even hit me by mistake. But even just tapping you like that in the face hurts. I just, I was walking down Finchley, Rudolph, a couple of 6th former said, oh, you lanky goglide freak. And I just wondered if maybe you could pop around and have a word with them. I will. Some of your friends. An enemy of yours is an enemy of mine. Scorpio rising, death in Vegas and XFM 104.9. Steve, I'm Ricky Germain's Carl. Carl's a little bit more, less stressed now. There's camera crew of gone. His dad's not listening, we think. Yeah. Who knows? You're chilled. I'll tell you what, though, me mom was loving it. Do you know rockbusters? I love. Do I know. Robust is rockbusters, I think I dream of it. She was taking part. I mean, she doesn't know a lot of the new bands and that, but she, she made some up for some older bands and that. She did some herself. She made some herself. Sent them in the post. So are you gonna use those today? Um, she's not quite got the anger of it. That's unlike a genius, son. Have you got them there? Can we hear what they are? Do you keep talking a second, then I'm quite excited. I mean, if they're. If they're even approaching, say, the genius of wet knee, Houston. Yeah. Yeah, there was another one, which is something to do with a trench. Carl, what was that? Oh, that was Dandy Warhol's. That was a good one. Dandy Warhol. I think that was his. That was his finest moment. Yeah. Incidentally, I've got an email here from someone called Saudi, if that's he or she. But let's assume it's a she, just for glam's sake. Yeah, she says she saw an old man eating a Twix last week, Carl, so that blows your theory at all. I'm not having it. Okay, Sam, if you are a bloke. He'S calling you a liar. So maybe you want a little rumble later. In fact, if you are a bloke, he's calling you a girl. Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah. Then these are ones that my mum's made up. Brilliant. Right, just in case you're a new listener, I'll give some initials out and a cryptic clue and it makes up a band on it. Or solo eyes. Not so much cryptic as what you're thinking. My mom sent this one. This group would be good at doing your hair. This group would be good at doing your hair. TP. Is there a group called the Hairdressers from the sixties? TP. TP, TP. Is it there something. The platters. Yeah, that's all right. Let's have a look. This group sound like dinosaurs. Group sound like dinosaurs. T Rex. T Rex. Yeah, I see what you mean. They're not so much cryptic. This group. This group likes being by the sand and the sea. They're the Beach Boys. This band are called the Beatles. We just have just. What else you got? Because one of them that she's done, I'm actually doing today, I thought of in the week. Right. Is it the same clue? It was, yeah. Wow. Great minds think alike. There's a last one from her. This guy sounds superb. This guy sounds superb. The bachelors, Glenn Campbell. I tell you this, I think you should get on to one of the big game organizations, Parker Brothers or whatever, because this has got to be. I mean, this could sweep the nation at Christmas. Don't you think this is the perfect Christmas game? Yeah, I think this is what's going to make or break the MTV thing, right? Some kind of tv version. Yeah. I'm just thinking into ad breaks, you know. Coming up next is this band. Be careful, the car, because, you know, make sure you retain the rights because I can see this selling abroad. Yeah. And I can see someone coming along and taking this sort of like the rock busters and changing one word and, like another native, like another game out of it and just using the same format. I know. I can't think of ever. But they could change. So sort of like they change the word rock to something else and have it. What could it be? Brick block. Yeah. And so, you know, I mean, so be careful. Blockbusters will never work. Look at his little face. So. So, yeah, so we're doing that later. Got some good prizes. Okay, we'll talk about the price. Educating Ricky. Yeah. We've got the woman who's got a ghost in her house. Yeah. It's a shame she's not here live because I feel like I want to ask a few questions. Rick, I don't know about you. Don't worry, I've covered it all. You've covered it all? Yeah. So, yeah. Play a record, Rick. I know probably you, like me, are just too busy, really, to keep abreast of new music, aren't you? We're busy people. We've got, you know, important showbiz pirates to go to and stuff. That's why I have friends of mine who send me compilations and stuff. That's one of my quarterly compilations from my friend Harry. And that's all downhill from here by Jim O'Rourke. I've got a new track coming up later, actually, that I think you might like. So, you know, we're, um. We're inflaming each other's desire for new songs as well as going back to the back of some classics. Sure, sure. All right. I love adverts better, though. I do. I love adverts. It's weird. Missy Elliot on XFM 104.9 or could you vase with me, Steve and Carl? Carl, why have you got headache? You got headache? Just a bit stressful. Because the moves. Moves on this this week. Are you behaving? He. Oh, by the way, the exfm listeners came around to me house and bought the food on and table. Did they? Quite normal. They were well happy. Yeah. Couldn't believe the lock with it. Quite normal. What do you mean, quite normal? Well, it sounds a bit scared and it getting. Getting people around. I imagine they were scared. Were they excited to see you? Could they? I mean, they were, you know. Could you tell that they were pretty pleased to see you? No, I don't think so. I mean, yeah, but I. The fellas, sort of. I mean, they brought the whole family round, which was a bit odd. But it's not often they get the chance to visit a living creek. Anyway. Anyway, no, they were not. They were nice. And you're moving now, he said. He phoned me up today, you know, it was absolutely tipping it down. He had to cycle in because he said, because of the move, he doesn't want to leave his bike around there. And he said. He said. And Suzanne. Oh, I can't say this because he's listening, can I? He won't know. Suzanne's hired the oldest removal man in London. You should hear him. And the thing is, right, we booked him. We booked him because everyone else happened to be booked out. But this fella's free, right? So he called up this morning. I've never spoke to him, but he was on the phone. He sounded about 90. Yeah. Can't think that he's gonna have to do all the work. And the thing is. Well, it seems he wanted some werther originals. Listen, it seemed to be cheap because it's 50 pound an hour. How long is it gonna take him? When's the move on then? When's the empty? He's coming, right. He came round today to bring some empty boxes and he was struggling with them. So it actually happens on Wednesday. Oh, God. Anyway, so, Richard, I think you were. Laughing and almost had a heart attack. Doesn't bode well for the boxing car. For the moment, I've had me Lem zip. Anyway, what we doing there, Carl? Well, I teased you with it before. You gonna get it out again? I'm always trying to get you thinking open and opening your mind up a bit to ghosts and stuff. Yes. So this woman who I know, she. She said she'd come in and I could interview her to try and sort of, you know, get the belief out there. Okay. So there's not enough belief in the occult and rubbish out there. So does she think she has a good. She has, yeah. She's. No, it's bad. So I thought maybe it's a new feature we could try for a couple of weeks, see how it goes down, you know. You know, Parkinson. Uh huh. What about Pilkington? Welcome to Pilkington. My guest today is Taran. She's a plugger. You still a plug, right? No, do co management. Right, she does co management, but she was a plugger. She looked after therapy, raging speed on slash, all the big names. Yeah, but we're not here to talk about music today. We do a lot of that on XFM today. We're talking ghosts. Now, Ricky and Steve, who I do the show with, they're not having any of it. So I said, well, I know someone who gets on with ghosts, does a lot of them. So I thought I'd get you in today, have a little chat for a couple of minutes, just to sum up the story so they get an idea of what happened. You had a horse. Yeah? You had it in some stables. He hasn't let us speak yet. You went to look after it and that, play around with it, take it for a ride. Yeah. Two of your mates were in the stable where your horses. Not my stable. In the opposite stable. In the opposite stable. And I heard them giggling and messing about. Yeah. You heard them having a laugh. So you thought, right, what are they up to? So you go in, they're messing about with the Ouija board. Yeah. Right. So this is where you come in. Did you get involved with the Ouija board? Unfortunately, I did. Right. And what happened then? Then I was like, oh, you don't believe in this. Oh, let me have a go, right. And ask a few questions, put our hands on. And it actually started moving. So a lot of the stuff you asked, it, did the things happen that last. Yes, they did. So that's scary for a start, right? We haven't even got to the ghost bit yet. So you mess about, trap soul. So you're messing around the Ouija board, you say, right, I've had enough of this now, yeah? I've got all the answers I need. Yeah, you go home. I didn't like them. You go in the house and it's a bit nippy, the house. The flat is absolutely fine, is when I went into the bedroom. You've got to remember, it's a very, very warm, hot evening, right? And walk into the bedroom and no note. It is cold, colder than usual. But I'm actually quite glad because it's so hot. Right, okay. Completely ignored the fact that the windows were all shut, but the curtains were blowing. Didn't sleep well at all. Right, next evening, same again. Freezing. Yeah. Very, very noticeably cold. Curtains blowing. Yeah. I fast asleep, get woken up, the wardrobes opening. So at this point, this is where we clear up. You're not. You're not on crack, you know. Never touched drugs in my entire life. You're not a drinker. No, I would have the old glass of red wine. Yeah, right. That's. That's all right. They recommend that anyway. They say it's good for your art. What started happening was, as the week progressed, I also felt the bed covers, at one point at night, fold over, double bed. The bed covers fold over. And it was like someone was getting in the bed next to me. But you got to remember, when you're in a deep sleep, you're not quite thinking, and you're thinking, I'm losing it. I was getting more and more tired, more and more. A little stressed. I'm really thinking I was having a breakdown. The final straw was when the clothes on the end of my bed that I just throw hit me. How come you were going back home at night? Because I was skeptical. In fact, six months ago. I don't want to go there. People will think I'm mad. But you know what? I don't care. Yeah, I know. There's more out there. Well, brilliant. Well, cheers for that. And thanks for being a guest on. On Pilkington. Incisive investigative journalism there. I like the fact that you've learned a lot from Parkinson's, even stealing some of his questions, like, are you on crack? Which. Yeah, yeah. I like the fact that when she went, I don't know, I have the occasional way. So I. For you. Good for you. Out. That was great. It was brilliant. That's the best interview technique I've ever heard anywhere. I feel like there's still some questions unanswered. Yeah. It hasn't proved it to me. I'll be honest. Carl hasn't proven the existence of. Of ghosts. I was worried as soon as she got involved with the Ouija board. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was thinking, please do not get. With that Ouija board. I was worried. We said I had some giggling from coming from the other stable. Yeah. Don't go over there. What questions did she ask the Ouija board? You didn't ask her that? I noticed she didn't. She didn't. She didn't want to say no. Okay. Do you think it was something like why, that you did to try and confuse the computer and the spirit world got really annoyed, and they got confused, and they came back and started messing up her clothes. But what? What do you think then? What do you mean? What do you mean, what do I think? What do you think? What about what? There's nothing I can answer there. There's nothing I can answer. All right. She said, well, I'll just keep saying, I don't believe in the existence of ghosts because of the impossibility. Right. Now, when she said, I mean, the interview I did for 50 minutes. You did for how long? 50 minutes. 55 minutes. Yeah. We might use that Christmas or something. Right. But the thing is. Well, that's the best you got out of 50. Yeah, they're the highlights. Now, MTV. You're not going to call again? I'll tell you what, right, it did get a bit dark and I didn't want. I didn't want that. But, um, I can, I can understand the heating thing. I said, well, you know, in the fall interview, I was saying, you know, that could, that could be anything, could it? Heating broke or something. Now, she said that the. What else was she talking about? Someone got into the bed next to her. Yeah. I mean, I sort of said, well, um, you know, how did that happen? Yeah. She wouldn't explain it herself, but I said. But it did wake you up? Maybe you're a little bit sort of. Although the only explosion I can think of if she didn't actually see anyone is whether it was a ghost. Yeah, well, she might probably got a ghost. Cupboards opening and shutting. See, that's again the only explanation. That is a ghost. Yeah, I got anything else? Play record. It's got to be a ghost. It is ghost. I think you've proven it to us. Yeah, a spirit in straight spirit. Yeah, nice. Street spirit. Radiohead. So, turns out ghosts do exist after. All, Steve, a woman what car knows proved it. I've got egg on my face. Yeah, on XFM. I should just encourage you and everyone else listening. James, Randy, a hero of yours. And here. Mine. Yeah, he's on tv this week on horizon. I think it's maybe Thursday. Check press for details. Trying to expose the. The nonsense that is homeopathy. Oh, yeah, I saw that. Yeah, I look forward to that. Do you know what that is, Carl? They've got a theory that if you say you got something, an essential oil or something in a solution, one in ten solution, and it does something to you, actually does something to you, they've got this thing where they dilute it. Dilute it to. There's nothing in it. But because they're using the same water, the water still has the same effect. It's sort of like. It's sort of like a placebo that, you know, works, you know, that's the sort of theory of it. What time's on? Check the papers. But I think it's sort of 09:00 Thursday, something like that. It'll be interesting that, Carl. It will be interesting, mate. Trust me. I'll tell you what's also interesting, Rick. The prizes were given away this week on rockbusters. We got for you, David Attenborough is the life of mammals. I don't know. Is this a new show? Is this on tv at the moment? Is this. Yeah. So that looks good. Double vhs thing there. We've also got a U two. The best of their nineties videos. Even better than the real things on there. Mysterious ways, beautiful day, electrical storm. The new one stuff on there that's on the video. We've also got a couple of CDs, the smashing pumpkins. I think this is sort of alternative versions of a lot of their hits and stuff. Live versions and stuff like this. Johnny Cash's current album, possibly his last. We don't know, because apparently he's not very well at the moment, so. An album of covers. Yeah, we're not all covers. Some of his new stuff as well. But he's done covers of things like personal Jesus by Depeche Mode and Desperado and bridge over troubled water. And the great thing about Cash is I read an amazing review where it says it's like he always makes them his own. Do you know what I mean? It's like you can't even remember the old version. Desperado. By the Eagles. By the Eagles. Yeah. I'd like to play that because I haven't heard that. We'll play that and then give it away. These are actually good prizes. We've also got. We're including a small miniature three wheel car, an only fools and horses video. I think this is the special that was on Christmas tv last year. So if you're one of the. The people who didn't see it. I mean, wasn't there like 22 million. If you're one of the people who, you know, desperately wants to see it again. I know. I too. And wants a small yellow car. Also wants to. Then. Then there is. And also another of these compilations. Arbitrary compilation albums. The best chill out album ever. Rick. Sure. If you're a fan of the Levi's freedom ad, then you. Freedom ad, then they're the track that. I hate the music to it, though. No, no. Well, that's a shame, because. How much do you love the Volvo tv advert? Love it. Love it. Because that. Hate the music again, though. Why? That's a shame because. Okay, sure. There's also stuff on here. There's some interesting stuff. There's Pink Floyd, there's Coldplay. There's Roy Scott, so, you know, it's probably worth. I love Pink Floyd, except the music again, so that's a whole heap of treats. And that's the winner of Rockbust. Winner of Rockbust coming up after the adverts. Okay, doves caught by the river on XFM. 104. 4.9 wins the second hour. Now, this is when this award winning show really kicks into gear. When you say award winning, we haven't won them yet. I mean, we will win some. Hang on, let me remind you, there are bronze in the Sony awards, okay? We got bronze. It doesn't count. Doesn't count. I'm Ricky Deveze, obviously. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington, which is what he write about, really. Carl's the main man. Think of Carl a year ago, he was just sitting in that room going, all right, I've done this. XFM. It's good, yeah, it's like a music bed. Brilliant. Comes on the show, we start taking the piss out of him. People start going, oh, is the idiot you've got in? We go, is Carl. And they go, we like him. He said, he's a fool. Okay? Yes, he's a fool. He's a pet buffoon. And I go, we'll let him speak more. Right? And they're going, don't let him talk. Don't let XFM, the fat cats. Oh, and I said, I'm a rebel and I do it my way. Rick, I asked, did you stick it to the man? Yeah. And then MTV call up? Yeah. He writing about him every week. Yeah, he's just been doing film for the BBC. Some rumors he might be the new James Bond. Yeah, yeah. He's got his. He's got. Is he in? Lovely McVit is original justice. Are we allowed to listen? I love these biscuits. Yeah. And. And he's got the best. If the spearmint rhino strip clubs are listening, I'm a huge fan. Right. And he's got rockbusters to come. Yes. A few people have asked me this and there's also an email here from rich people are saying they've seen some of the posters and the adverts of advertising the show. Plug in the show. Why isn't your. Why aren't you on the posters, Carl? And is your choice, isn't it? We did ask Carl to be involved. Well, he is, actually. It's life. Where's Waldo? Is actually. He's in my trousers. You don't want. You don't. You don't. You're not seeking the publicity. I reckon you are secretly. I don't believe. No, he's right. He's totally right. He's doing it just right. But I think there's, that. There's a fine line to be drawn that, you know, if you like being in, you know, around radio, you've got and you want your own show or you enjoy talking and they just happen to be filming you from tv, that's different. I think what you just avoid is going to silly celebrity bash is having a picture taken for the sake of it. I mean, I think you're right, but I think you should do the screen test on a serious note, I think you should do the screen test just because it might be fun. And if it's no good, they won't do it. And you can stop any time you want. No one has to keep going on telling. I just think we're going to lose him. No, no, won't lose him. Listen, right? I'll always be part of this. I'm just worried that you're gonna get. You're gonna exhaust yourself, you're gonna be drained. You're gonna have told all your anecdotes. He certainly would have. If you have to help the old fellow upstairs with a bed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 50 pounds an hour. Oh, that's terrible. Go on. But what I wanted to do, right? Because I don't want to embarrass myself, right? I don't want to embarrass the woman at MTV when I turn up and she thinks, oh, look at him. Yeah, what a waste of film this is gonna be. Because it's not cheap. I know it's not film either, but go on. Well, it works. They're filming on a dv camera that they can go over. If it's no good, they won't show it to anyone. It'd be great. It's just what they want. You, honestly, I could just see you doing little things, just like popping up, you know, between the records and going, all right, MTV music television. Hear about the airy chinese kid born? Which is weird, isn't it? Because they're not usually airy. It just goes, MTV, be brilliant. It'd be brilliant. Karl, if I'll come down with you, I'll come down with you. Well, we'll see. Go on. We'll think about it. Right? Rock western. So rockbusters, you know, it's a little clue. Some initials, three different clues. You email in Ricky Gervaisefm dot co dot UK. You can win the load of stuff that we've got so first one is a clue. Stop throwing that fruit about. Oh, what's the initial? That's CB. CB. CB. Stop throwing that fruit about. Yeah. All right. Is Anders listening as he emailed us. In it and it's not. Not. Any response from Anders. I'll keep her. Keep maybe stop listening. He doesn't like the show. He's gone off. I wasn't gone off the show. So the second one. That scottish fella has made an error. That scottish fella has made an error. Yeah, that's. That's m him, right. That scottish fella has made an error. Right. And the last one. God, you can make a right load of toast with them. You can make a right load of toast with them. Yeah. All right. What's that? That's G. G. I was thinking it might be bread for a minute, but no, gee. So just very quickly, stop throwing that fruit about. CB. I've got the last one. Right. Scottish fellow. It doesn't work. It doesn't count. Doesn't count. Well, that scottish fellow has made an error. That's mistaken. And, God, you can make a right load of toast with them. That's g. Email in Ricky. Dot gem, dot co dot UK. And you can. We've got the CDs, we've got horses, we got mammals on VHS. We got you too. We got comfort CDs, including Johnny Cash. There's a new tune from a new fella called Papa Garcia. See what you think of this. See, if he was on MTV, I couldn't say his name. Why. Why is it again Papa Garcia? Right, here's a new one from Papa Garcia. Papa Garcia, Natalie and Nusey from the forthcoming album bring me the head of Papa Garcia. Catchy, that. Quite retro. So bit of. A. Bit of out on John and all sorts. Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Right, here we go. Quick clues again. And then we better do educating Ricky. This is the favorite bit of the show for me now, educating Ricky. I love it. I can't. Well, yeah, I'm anxious all week. Well, just quick, quickly on those clues just in case people need to know. Again, stop throwing that fruit about CB. That scottish fellows made a bit of an error. M and God, you can make loads of toast with M. That's g. Ricky. Doctor Gervais fm dot co dot Uk. It's email only. Oh, I need some learning. I need some knowledge. Carl, educate me. Go on. We've got three things. As always. I give them a little heading to tease you as to which one you want to learn first. Yeah, first one is. Is the tip included? Is the tip included. Like it. Second one. I want to come here in hindsight. I wouldn't have come here in hindsight. Yeah. Okay. And the third. 01:00 a.m.. I. Gonna have to thump you. Am I gonna have to thump you? Mmm. Okay. What? The Internet. So if I can get into the mindset of this plan, is the tip included? Well, obviously, that's probably not gonna be about a way. It's gonna be like, is that someone losing the end of his knob? I assume I'm gonna have to thump you. That's a man who lost his arm in a fight, but then picked it up with the other arm and smacked him with it. What was the middle one? I want to come here in hindsight. Hindsight. Hind hines sight. Yeah. Yeah. Someone was blinded by baked beans. So what are you going for then? I think I better go for armor. Gonna have to thump you. All right, well, this isn't. I've been struggling again, to be honest with you, searching iron low for stuff. And some of these I had to leave till this morning. Right. Because there's just not enough knowledge out in the world, is there? You don't know about. I found out about something in the week about a guy who was playing tug of war. This is bonus material. His arm came off. He's only his arm. Come on. Yeah. He got caught up in the rope. Yeah. No, no, he didn't. He didn't get caught up in the rope. He just was trying that hard and didn't want to lose. He kept holding. He allowed his arm to be pulled off. He really wanted to win. The other team pulled it, and his arm come off. No. I don't know who to believe. Well, and think about it. If he's gripping. Yeah. As soon as there's tension, like the arm coming out of the socket, the hand might release. I think his arm got caught up in the rope, and so it was involuntary, as opposed to him going, well, my arms coming off. I'm not gonna lose this. You might anyway. That. That's the fact. That's a bonus. That's a bonus fact. Yeah. That's educated me. Well, a man lost his arm. Oh. Interested? Go on. Oh, my God. I have to thump you. Yeah. You know the saying, uh. Shut your face. Yeah, I've heard the well known shakespeare in it. Yeah. You know, it came about. No Joe Dolce. Ah. Gone. It's, uh, ages ago. Oh, yeah. Literally. Literally. Like knights who wore armor. Okay, that's, uh, armor gonna have to something, you know, so it came about. Okay, armor. Um, they wore all the stuff and they had the helmet and safety. The guard in something at night stood outside a castle or something. Yeah. And it's probably going to be two of them, right? So they stood there talking and that and, uh. Talking about stuff and the future, medieval stuff. One of them. One of them is like, we should shut up. You know, I've been studying for hours and he's going on and on. Yeah, sure. So he'd say, shut your face, meaning shut the guard down on your helmet, the visor, and I can't hear you then, so shut your face. Shut your face. That's how it came about. It would be interesting if I could just rely on it. I'm not sure it's true. I know. I just never know. I can. It needs to be cooperated. Like, I don't know where he got it from, but anything via Carl is precarious. Yeah. I mean, I feel like maybe you should give us your sources next time. You know, tell us the Internet. Yeah, but where on the Internet? I can't remember where that one. I mean, I always go through, like, the news pages and stuff and I. This news should be updated because they've already reached the 17th century, which is last week, with people eating tomatoes off lead blades. I look at news and there was stuff about a woman who was in a shop and she. I don't know, some. They had some workman in. Workman in doing the shop up, and they had some wood glue left out and chest for some pear juice. And then the guy went and thought the glue in the thing was the pear juice and she went and drank that. But that's not really news. No. So I thought, well, we're not really. I wish you hadn't told us there was one about. So there's some poor woman now whose ties of tiles have fallen off because she tried to put them up with pear juice. Yeah, see, that's the. That's the danger of mixing up pear juice with toxic glue. Your wallpaper and your tiles and everything just fall down. Everyone being careful. There's something about kids having amber because it makes them fat. Hold on. What? You. Having food with high fat content can make you put on weight. Don't believe it. You're an idiot. What's the next one? You still got to come. You've still got. I want to come here in hindsight, and you've still got. Is a tip included? But we've got a bit of. Well, I think we haven't played anything for a while, have we, in terms of the hip hop hooray feature that I used to be so popular for. So I thought we just resurrect that for one week. Only he didn't pick up on that one. Let me just remind you, hip hop hooray was where I played a hip. Hop track and then I said, hooray. Yeah, well, no, no, brilliant. That's great. That's a great thing, though. We could add that in. We could phase that in maybe the end of the song. Brilliant. Brilliant. Featuring puff Daddy and little Kim. That's notorious b I g. Notorious. Great. Lovely. Carl just said to me, here's something you can't hold your breath to death. Have you tried it, Carl? Just another little lesson. Someone here is in a really low air. They just started holding their breath in on. What did you learn in the week? Right. I'm always doing all the educating. I asked you, you were talking about watching a program about jellyfish. Yeah. And I said, well, that'll be interesting. I'll try and find some stuff out. But I couldn't find anything that I didn't already know about them. It must be difficult for you to find anything you don't already know. So what. What did you learn about jellyfish? I agreed with you by the end of it that they should be wiped off the face of the earth because they're balls of water in membrane, right? That go around stinging people to death. Let's lose them, Carl. Let's lose the jellyfish. Yeah, that's what I think. I was stung by one. Do you know you got stonewall? Yeah. And I don't understand. The jellyfish conundrum. We've solved that particular worry. Right, then, so take your pick. Then I asked him is, what if he could have any animal? The other day, I asked him on air as well. Didn't know. Off air. He said, I've got it down to two, right? And this was. He said. We said, what a favorite animal looking at. Or could I own one? And I went, you could own one. And he went, right, but could I own one or I have trouble. Wait, Carl, you've got all the expertise. You can just have it in whatever it needs. You go down there. Went, right, and I won't regret it and get fed up. Said, no, Carl, just what animal? If you could have any animal. What an old. Even. I've got enough. I went, what is it? He said, either the rhino or the hippo. What's your logic? Well, I don't know that that was then. I mean, ask me tomorrow. Favorites, do you know. When was that? A couple of weeks ago. When was that? We were there. Yeah, but you know what you say quickly, now. First, you know, any animal I want. You can have any animal in the world from party one that's maybe extinct. Anything you want, right? I might have, um. I might. Just for today. Just for today, I might have a scorpion in a little box. A little scorpion in a box. What's your. What's your thinking? It's the chimp. Every time it's the chimpanzee or the gorilla. No, but have I tell you that program about the scorpion? And they all help each other out, right? Scorpions all help each other. No, no, this is brilliant. Right? Somewhere in the desert, okay, there's these little desert. It's like these little monkeys that are underground or something, and there's. There's holes. Is this beneath the planet of the apes? No, and you've got it wrong. Anyway, they're not monkeys. There's little monkeys under the goose. Underground mines. They're lizards, if you remember. And the lizard goes to sleep. When the bloke comes along, you've told this monkey from monkey, Lizard. That's what happens in his mind. From lizard to monkey. Oh. Evolution would have been so much easier if Carl was around. Turn it into a monkey. I'm fed up with a lizard. Just promise me once again, Carl, I've asked you before. Promise me you'll never have children. Go on. Right. Okay. Right. What you having? What's one again? Is the tip included? Yeah, go on. That one. Right. In Turkey. Nice. It's not actually. That's where I went. And there was them little fellas after Suzanne, in the kitchen. What? What do you mean? We stayed in, uh. We went to Turkey. You went to Turkey? And there's some little fellas, well, they. Had quite a few sort of midgets working in the kitchen. Why? Is it a theme? Is it a theme holiday? I don't know. Might get them cheaper or something. Was it a worthy? So they were working in the kitchen, and one of them fancied Susan and kept sort of eyeing her up. And she was winding me up, saying. Oh, not eyeing up and down. Just eyeing her up. What was she doing in the kitchen? No, it's like a pick. Pick what you want to eat type, Buffy. But you have people clearing their tables and that ready for you to come along. Late, low tables and. And, you know, he was just keeping an eye on her. What would he say, though? Turkish? I don't know what he was saying. What do you mean? A little fella. What do you mean, little fella? Sort of dwarf, like. Dwarf like he had magic powers or. He was four foot. What do you mean, Carl? A little bloke. Just like a normal bloke, but small. If you stood him in the desert, you wouldn't know. But he beat art and. Right. He should watch out for the monkeys. Underground. Monkeys. You can't just say there was a little midget fella who was eyeing up my girlfriend and then. Leave it. What do you mean? What was happening? This is a story to us. This is much more interesting to us than. And she was deaf, right. And she ate red. That's much more. I don't understand how this. How it manifested itself. Did he come over and say something now? Do you know, you know when it's like girls know, don't they? When. When some. Someone fancies them. What do you mean? There was lots of them as well. That's worth knowing. Right, come on. So you went into this. You went to this holiday. Yeah. And you went into the. What, the dining room or something? Yeah. Downstairs. And you look, there's no one serving. Yeah. You look down and there was a little waiter. There was loads of them running around, busy. Why, though? What do you mean? They come out in summer. They come out in summer. What do you mean? They had more. What do you mean? Midgets? I don't know. Maybe. Don't heat stunt your growth or something? No, well, they just happened to. Maybe it was a thing that they did for tourists or something. I don't know. I just got on with my meal. It was a holiday. Surfing. I'm not going to ask any questions. Right, okay. Yeah. So they're all little fellas running around. And this one always was like, you know, oh, do you want a new serve yet? You know, I mean, going out of. His way, turning on the charm. Yeah, his way. The others weren't right. I think what was happening is he'd been working with Santa all for winter bread. This one was your waiter. And so he was being polite to you. Maybe, maybe, maybe. But what did Suzanne say then? When she was what? Using it to warm you up? What was she saying? Always just like, you know, look, he. May be small, but he's well built. Like a. Yeah, he's all man. So were you jealous of a midget then? You were jealous of. It is a bit annoying in it. Why? It won't bother me as much now because I've been with her for ages. Right. But at the time that might have been one of our first holidays and it's like you don't want to pay for this holiday and then you get. Off with a midget. Oh. So anyway. But it doesn't matter because you got chatted by a bearded lady. No, that's got nothing to do with that. What were you gonna say? What were you gonna say? I was gonna say the hotel was after bored and maybe. All right, I thought you're gonna say it's just one of her shortcomings. So listen, right, player, play a replica. Right? Badly. Drum boy, born again. Right. Just get this educating Ricky out the way. So turkey. Yeah. So what is this again? That educating Ricky is a tip included. Apparently a fellow was on holiday in Turkey. Just having a normal holiday. Weather's good, you know, he's having a good time. White is a normal height. Yeah yeah yeah. He's having his meal. Here's a load of screaming going on in the kitchen as his girlfriend wandered. In there. With a step ladder. The circumcised people in the kitchen and apparently. What are you talking about? Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Slow down. We were talking about. I'm excited about two things at once here. One, they, it's circumflex in the kitchen. Two, I guessed it was someone losing end of their knob. I started thinking like, Karl Pilkington. Extraordinary. That is amazing. Apparently it was. It was going on. It wasn't just a one off either. Well, when I say a one off, I mean they did it more than once. Yeah, right. And there was. He was there for a week and apparently the first night it was quiet. And then the rest of the week, every day, it'd be like having his breakfast or even his lunch or even his tea. Yeah, it'd be doing it all day. Oh, you'd be here in lunch and breakfast. Fair enough for it. Yeah, don't do that. Apparently it's a tradition over there. You can't even make a complaint about it. It's like, well, you should have, you know, should have found out before you. You come over. See, I can't believe this is. Sorry. He's in a restaurant in a hotel. And there are people having circumcisions in. In the kitchen in the. Is that right? I'm even worried that we're bordering on the racist here suggesting that that is vision. That turkish people cut the end of their cocks off in the kitchen. Yeah, at meal times. I think you're wrong, Kyle. This sounds ludicrous, Carl. No, I don't think it happens everywhere. Right. I think this just. This hotel. Certain. Certain places. Hotels. What is it, like two star? Yeah. Why did he go to the Foreskin Inn? It was his own fault, wasn't it? So sorry. That. That's it, is it? Have they clue. That's the story. You educated me. Right. Once a fellow saw some turkish people cutting the tip of their. No moving the kitchen. Thanks very much. Thanks very much, Carl. Got any more? Well, these things you can learn from it either. Don't go to Turkey. No. Don't have Calamari when you're over there. Carl, you've done it again. Well, you too. I love that one. On XFM 104.9, I'm Ricky Germain's Steve Merchant. Carl. Okay, Karl, one more. Can we just don't get the ump. Just because so far you come up with nothing. What's the last one? Give us the teaser clue. It was, I want to come here in iron sight. I wouldn't have come here in hindsight. Yeah. Give me some education. This would be the thing that teaches me something. I can feel it in my bones. Come on. There's a kid in Kenya, he was messing about with some beans. Magic. We guessed that as well. He did, yeah. He's fed up because we've guessed his puns. I think they put one of them in his ear. The mam or the dad said, oh, what have you done that for? Or whatever. So I'll have to take you to the doctors now. So they took the kid to the doctors and the doctor said, oh, he said, I can get that out. I can sort that out for you. So he took it out and the doctor said, right, that's three pound 50. And the dad said, I've only got 270 on me. And the doctor said, right, well, he put the bean back in his kid's ear. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I mean, a couple of questions for me very quickly. Are you sure that those were definitely the sums involved, were they? Well, the equivalent of whatever. Whatever the deal with in Kenya. Yeah. It was the equivalent of. So you would say, what currency was it, Carl, that you translated into sterling? I don't know. It was saying in the thing, it said the equivalent of 3.152.7. Did it say that? Yeah. Sorry. Did it say that? Yeah, Carl, look at me. Look at me. Did it say that? Yeah, he said. He said that's. That. That was the. Did it say that? Yeah, yeah, it did. It definitely said that. Definitely, yeah. So it's just like. I suppose. I don't know. I mean, all these things. The idea is it's not like a lesson. It's like, I'll tell you this. See what you can get from it. Sure. So you look at what I've told you already. The knights who said, shut your face. That's like. That's amazing. Explains itself. Yeah. Turkey with the circumcisions in a restaurant. Yeah. That hold me in good stead. Yeah. Don't go there. Whatever. This one. If you're in, Ken, you don't put beans in your ears or something. Doctors. Or carry three pounds 50 or the equivalent of. It's just the idea that the doctor put it back in his ear. He forced back in his ear. So is it still there to this day? I mean, is there any update on that? Or did he go back with the 350? I presume he either went and got, like, a second opinion, see if he could get it cheaper. Right. Another doctor. Yeah. Or he said, right, I'll come back next week. Yeah. After I've been paid. Or he saw how the doctor did it and thought, well, I'll have a go at that. Shall go home. Yeah. For free. But he never said what it. How it ended. No, no. But I mean, I apologize for this week. I mean, I. I haven't got that much out of it. You've not been rich. Oh. It was very, very light. Like I say, there was the. The tug of war. There was a fella in Scotland who had a load of tattoos. Okay. Is that it? 98% covered. Right. Just between his toes. He didn't have to. Why not? Because it looks stupid. I don't know. It just said. It just said 98% done. Are you gonna drop the feature? You were. I'm thinking about it. Don't drop the feature. Honest with you, he had probably written about this already. This has been a classic. I'm concerned because it's my favorite part of the show. I'm wondering if. Is there something else we could. What could we do to help you out? Because I just. I hate to see it go. Well, we can't really. And he's moving this week with the old fellow, so that. Taking about four days. I'm worried that you're not. I'm worried you're not looking to a library. Quick question for you, Carl, who is a possible guest on next week's Pilkington? What about your removal, man. Right. Listen, if you. If you've had an experience, it could be anything. Right? Doesn't have to be you seen a ghost. It can be that you, you know, you think you're gonna live forever or you can, you know, do any mentalist out there, if you're slightly, you know, wrong, if there's something wrong with you, just. Is it Carl dot Pilkington dot co uk? Carl dot Pilkington at XFM dot co dot Uk. Would you like to be interviewed on next week's edition? Yeah, if you are a mental of any description. Just lonely, bewildered, stupid. Just something wrong with you. Right. And you've seen some of that's, you know, interesting to you, but absolute bollocks, then please call Carl. Yeah, Carl document you off, by the way. Don't think, oh, they're going to take the piss out of me. Just if, you know, in any way, if it's, you know, fodder for us, then call up because Carl will like. You'll be friends with Carl. Quit the clues. What's the answers? We always do this. We run. Don't worry, we've got tune. And then we'll come back with the answers for rock clusters. Lot of great prizes. All right, we'll have a bit of cash. Cash. One of the prizes we're giving away. Johnny Cash and Desperado, that's from his. New album, which is a collection of new songs and covers, which is one of the prizes given away on this week's rockbusters. And can we have the clues and the answers and the winners? Yeah, first one was, stop throwing that fruit about. Stop throwing that fruit about. The answer is CB. That was Chuck Berry, the one that you've worked out. I'll do next. The. God, you make a load of toast with them. Gorillas. Gorillas, though, in it. Gorillas. And the middle one was that scottish fellas made an error. That was Mystique. Mystique. Mystique. Did anyone get that? Extraordinarily, almost all the people who emailed it. I'm going to think it's us. Thank you. Because I was thinking mistake. I was thinking muck error and muck mistake and mystic. Yeah. So pick a winner. Yeah. I was going to give the prizes to Amy Massey, who's from Wiltshire. The West country losers down there, probably. As weird as you. Yeah. So she's won and congratulations to her. I'm assuming she's listening online or maybe via some kind of. A lot of listeners outside London, because all these are from Norwich. And have we got any listeners in London places? You know, it's where there's a lot of inbreeding. Yeah. Nothing else to do. Norwich and Wiltshire. Well, you know. Cheers for that, Amy. Well, done. He waved, then when he said that he did. Yeah, he waved. No, he's working, getting ready for tv. Of course he is. Yeah. Oh, I think this week is it. Can it be arranged for this week? Yeah, yeah, I saw it out. Well, I'm busy this week. I'm moving. Of course. Let's talk about that. And you can do. You can do an edition of cribs. Wait, let I get rock stars to show them around there. Oh, we're done now. Set. Finished. So boring you.

Tell me why. Tell me why. Because that's when it finishes. What we finished got clear for the next. On the poster, it says one to three. It doesn't say one to 255. Right? You t. You, Carl, you press that button on. Hey, hey, hey. Yeah.",
