  "text": "Hickory Dickory doc. Some lads there just wrote a song called clocks. The lads are coldplay and the song is clocks. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant, Karl Pilkington. Pressing the little buttons there. XFM 104.9. What's that? What's that little. Mmm. Well, I think I do more than press the buttons. Right. You see, this is, this is it, right? A car has had a little strop on since last night. Okay. He's got a little strap on. Yeah. You said strop on. I just wanted to clarify. And it's. I don't. I don't know why he says that I'm an annoying person. He says I wound him up. Right. Which I don't know. He says that you're. You're winding up because you're sort of like negative about everything. Yeah. And then, but what I think it is is because we pointed out that his likeness is unacceptable. Yeah. He said, meet you at six. He turned up at 20 past. He said, well, someone stopped me in the corridor. I don't care. I've got stuff to do. We have stuff to do. I think we're a bit busier than you, Carl. You've got one job. We've got loads of jobs. I keep telling you that. You got one job in a little room, a nine to five there that you don't even get done in. Nine to five. That's why you're late and mucking around all the time. There's loads of work to do. Yeah, one job. It's one job with a lot of other jobs in it. It's like those little russian dolls you get, right? Yeah, it is, yeah. Everyone thinks, oh, he only sits in his studio messing about making songs. A phrase. That's what I do in my free time. Which we've got coming up later. Super slick. I still think 20 minutes late is an outrage. Yeah, 20 minutes later. But I didn't say bang on six or six. No, you didn't. You said six, which means six. Well, it doesn't. Sorry. It doesn't. If it was a news reader, I'd say, yeah, you've got to be on time. Do you know what I mean? If it was a 06:00 news, I wouldn't want to be late. But it's the fact that I said to you, I'm busy. I've got stuff. No, no, you didn't say that. You said 06:00 to sort out tomorrow. I know what I said. Yeah, well, you don't because I remember you sent me a text you didn't even. It wasn't even a phone call. Stephen stitched him up by being a little bit more precise than him. It was a text and it said, see you around six tomorrow, question mark around. You just said it. Well, give us six. It doesn't count. That doesn't mean anything. Well, yeah, no, it does. What, so you told me he said six. What? He did, I'm paraphrasing 06:00 rick, to me, even if it was around 06:00 that would be five to six or 06:05 it would not be 20 minutes after the event because that is late. Well, you can't even. You can't, you've got nothing. You see, I even got an excuse. Yeah, but then I turned up, right, and I said, right, well, let's not argue about this. Let's call it some good new features, because we've been in cheapest chimps that's gone today. Good news. He never liked you was chimps, Carl, did he? Right, you never liked it. You know what? You know, he's took it further. Donald McIntyre, he's doing, he's doing a program, cheapest chimps again, I'll prove you right. He's not doing a program. Cheap as chips, is it? He's not. What do you mean? He's doing a tour of trail on channel five. And it was saying, you know, is. It five or is it about 05:20. He'S doing this, he's done that, you know, now see him on Channel five because he's moved to channel five. He's saying, first big problem, chimps, you know, the deer and that. No, they're not deer. He's getting confused. No, no. 50 odd grand for a chimp. It's saying, you know, looking. So how much you can get gorilla for. What are you, what are in the name of God, are you talking about that? Later? But I don't know. What? I don't know. I'm just saying that. That's another idea. And then. Yeah, yeah, go on, you got off, this is why you never get stuff done. And you're like, you got off the point. You were talking about arriving late. Yeah, I know, but I'm just saying to you now, I'm just saying I turned up late, so I said, right, well, let's not argue. Yeah, I said, let's do some stuff. Yeah. You weren't having any of it. I think at one point you were trying to be sick on me leg. I do remember that, yeah. Why? Just, just for fun. Yeah, all right, that's all right. That's when I started getting annoyed. He was very annoyed last night. No. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I can see where that can be annoying. But you just gotta think, hey, look, so what? It's, you know. Well. Well, I think you rub each other up the wrong way. Yeah, that's a problem. Well, no more cheapest chimps today. Nothing to replace it because we don't have a chat. Song's a phrase. We're doing that. You can win some stuff. Yeah. We've got the film that we haven't done for the last two weeks. The final film. We want me to let him down. It's two weeks. So you're two weeks late on that. Great music. Yeah. Something from the only ones. Yeah. Brilliant. Another girl, another planet by the only ones. An Xfone 104.9. I recognize with me Stephen Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl, cheer up. Come on, there's a war on. Chill out. Yeah. I have to say, you have become increasingly annoying recently. Yeah, chiefly. I tell you what is. I think it's the. The hot weather. Can I just draw, just remind you when we were in the office recently, we've got a little office that we write in. We work in. And many, many moons ago, we were doing some work. This was when we were writing the first series of the. Of the office. And I was typing away. I was just typing something up we'd written, and I read it back to Ricky. Just check. He was happy with everything. I was reading it back, and as part of the thing, there was a knock in the script. It said, you know, knock. And I. So I was acting out for him and I knocked like this, and I realized he was listening. He was, in fact, asleep underneath his desk. And I knocked like that as part of reading the stage directions. I knocked. He thought someone was coming in. He leapt up, clunked his head, zipped up, thought something. I said, rick, I'm just acting that out for you. He just wasn't paying attention. He wasn't listening. And. Can I just go? So recently, we're in another office, we're typing away. I look round, he's got his shirt off. He's taking his shirt off, right? So he sat there, 41 year old man, or whatever you are, 40 year old man there with his shirt out. Beautiful. I mean, I've seen most parts of your body now, one point or another. I think from the early days when we used to work at XFM, you started showing me bits of your anatomy, which is something he does to people he likes. Friends of his. I'm sure you've seen most of it, Karl. And so that's what sat there. And there was a knock at the door because we'd asked someone who worked in the building to bring us something. And so I had to delay it by sort of not opening the door so he could get his shirt back on. So he was running around trying to get his shirt back on, because what. Would they have thought? What would they have thought? They'd have walked in. He'd have just been sat there, stripped to the waist, didn't they? Sort of thing. Hang on. What's going on? Locked through the keyhole. No, no, it was ludicrous, because as. They came in, he saw he was flustered, and he kind of was just leaning against the window, just looking like. I often stand here with my shirt back. I was getting like, Bernard Manning. You see Bernard Manning, whenever he goes into the house, he has to go upstairs to take his trousers off. I love that. The fact that in your house, you just got your pants and your vest on. That's what you want to do. Yeah, but it's all the time. It's not just. I mean, you haven't done that with me taking your clothes off and that yet. But, like, last night, we were sat in the pub, and I was saying, right, you know, let's not even worry about new features then. Let's. Let's get the current ones, you know, going. Like what? Like the one that was trying to work out the cheeky freak of the week. I'd looked online, right? I didn't find that much. I found, actually, I'll tell you what I found later. Brilliant. And then at one point, I think you said to me, go, you know, what about the Guinness Booker record? The best freak of the. In the world or whatever. Yeah. Ever. So I said, yeah, yeah, bring one in now. You've got one at home. Yeah. But you couldn't be bothered carrying that in today. So I had to go out of the pub that was at. Yeah, nip into borders, buy a Guinness book of Records out of my own money. $18.99. Yeah, bring it back. And then you said, oh, I don't know if I want to do this feature. So it cost me 20 quid for that. I had to buy a video for Silence of the Lamb's film clip. I'm actually out of pocket at the end of this, but do you want. To work with me? Is the thing. If you want to work with. People would pay that sort of money to work with me, Carl, you're a lucky bloke. Think how many people think, oh, Carl, he gets to drink and sit. Yeah. You were making a cup of tea and I. Surprised, didn't I? Little surprises. You know, last night, do you know, when I left the pub in a bit of a mood because I was just fed up with not getting anything done? Walking down the road, I was thinking, how can I get out of this? How can I stop having to work with them? I'm thinking, I wonder if I leave, I wonder if they'll be funny and they'll go, and then my boss will be giving me stick and thinking, how much notice have they got to give out? And all this is going through my mind. I'm walking home and got in, said, susan, I'm sick of it. She's going, you need to do it. We want to get a new kitchen. And I was like, yeah, but how big does the kitchen need to be? I was saying, do we need a big kitchen? Can we get a small one? Have we got enough for a small kitchen? Do we need so many cupboards? Can we just have wood instead of steel? All this trying to get out of doing this. Yeah. It's always. I always feel like, you know. Cause I like to think that I'm not perhaps as bad as him. Yeah. No, you annoy me in different ways. Like what? Obviously annoy you. Well, stuff. Stuff that, you know, I come up with ideas, say cheapest chimps, rock Busters Springs to mind. 15 Taiwan. 15 Taiwan. Let's just remind people what 15 Taiwan was. It was a little feature that I want to give a run. You know, get a little run, see if people like it. The premise being. No, there's no premise, just the title. No, we were gonna get 15 sort of ornaments. You'd explain them, and then people would call up and say that, I'm from Taiwan. God, you just explained why I didn't think that was a good idea by explaining the good. The funny thing is, Steve, right, I was walking down Regent street on Monday, walked past one of these big stores, right? And they've got all famous quote quotes on the windows, right? And one of them was something like an absurd idea is often a great idea. Yeah. Do you know who said that? Go on, Einstein. Yes. Which made me wonder, if you were his mate, would he ever do equals MC squared? Or would you have said, don't bother with that, it's not going to work. Because that's all you seem to do. Everything I come up with, you put down. Yeah, well, that's one thing he's negative. Right. I don't know why. I don't know why is what else. He messes me about. I get him concert tickets for stuff and you say, oh, I didn't bother going. Yeah. Yeah, that is annoying. You come in, you know, five minutes to go with tracks that need editing. Yeah, the little bag. That bag that was free. Yeah. You got a free bag today. An XFM little rucksack thing. You were like, oh, what's this? What's this rubbish? Ricky said, I'll have it there. Great. He said, no, I want it. Yeah, but it's free. I need it. I'll give that as a gift. So. So, I mean, I think I'm reflection. Steve is probably a little bit more annoying than me. I won't go that far. You are. You are annoying. If I had to go away for a week somewhere, if it was a quiet place. You are again, aren't you? That's two orders you had this week, this year. I mean, if it was a busy. Place, I'd probably go with you because people do, you know what I mean, staring at me all the time and that if I'm walking around with Steve. No, I'm just. Can I draw up a list of reasons I don't like you? I'll tell you. Because the list of reasons I know about you is incredibly long and getting longer. Just saying. Do you want another slap? There's a star. Ash XFN 104.9 Ricky J. Steve Merchant. Karl Pilkington. Karl. Alright, let's start again. Yeah, I'm gonna be the same, but let's start again. So what I mean is stop being grumpy and let's let me carry on being annoying because Steve's not gonna change. He's not gonna suddenly start going, you know what, Karl? I think your ideas are really good. Do you know what I mean? Remember when he came up with that idea, that game show idea? He went, well, it's not an idea, Carl. And he came to me, he said, oh, I've had it with Steve. What's it? He went, how did the office ever get on telly? What was the idea again? In summary, I don't want to talk. About it because someone will nick it. No, they won't. They will. Donald McIntyre has already got cheapest chimps I can say. I bet they're in the making of rockbusters as we speak. So I'm not going to tell you any more. I reckon Bob Olness is probably nicking that idea. Cheeky little. Right song's a phrase coming soon. Is it? Yeah. What is it this week? What's the, what's the phrase where? Um, remember the story told you ages ago about, uh, about my neighbor having a horse in their house? Oh, yeah. Having a horse, yeah. What's happened with that? Lenny Henry doing it as a series. So people nicking your ideas left, right and center. Well, that's, that's the phrase we'll be using anyway. What? My neighbor had horse in her house. How many words is that? Six. My neighbor had. So there's no grammar either. My neighbor had orse in house. My neighbor had orse in house. What? Right. What is the phrase my neighbour ad hoc in a house? Are there any prepositions? Are there any prepositions in this sentence? Look, don't judge it beforehand. You see, I'm turning over a new leaf. I think this is a great idea. I think Carl's a genius. And I look forward to hearing this enormously. Okay. And I won't be sick on your leg or squeeze your head or make you jump when you're making a cup of tea. Just looking through the. That is still the funniest thing, innit? Squeaking at someone when they got a cup of tea. Right. There are a lot of what strike me as seemingly pointless feats. Right. The Ginsburg is great. I used to love it as a kid. I've had about ten copies in my life. The last one I bought a couple of years ago, president. It was really good. I love it. I love the real records. Tallest, fattest, thinnest, best, fastest, most expensive, biggest out. But the ones that really annoy me are the ones that the reason these people are in there for are the only people that tried. What's the milk butter on your head? Most watches eaten. I just found that one. Kim Sung doo from South Korea ate five watches. The entire watch, with the exception of the wristband, in a time of 1 hour, 34 minutes. What do you make of that, Carl? Made in regular. Come on. How did the timing? Most live rattlesnakes held in the mouth. Eight live rattlesnakes held by. It just says an idiot. Ar this gives me an idea. Carl, talking of idiots, do you want to get into records? There's things in there that are just absolutely anyone could do. Like that one in big brother. I was watching it and it was some balancing sugar lumps. I want to go, how many people try that? If there's schools around Britain going, listen, we gotta get in the sugar lump award we got. It's grassroots level. There's not enough kids balancing sugar lumps. How can we compete in the world market? I was looking at it last night and there was one about. About the forest that a dog swam. I think it was something like 9 miles, but it had no choice. Did it out to Atlantic or something. Yeah. So it's not all right to put it in a bin bag and chuck it in a canal? No. Oh, it's for a world record. Yeah. 9 miles it did. Oh, ones that you could do. Carl, what's the most, the most forest gumps fitted in one wheelie bin? What about this one for you, Carl? The record stands at the moment for most arrows caught by hand, but that's quite tricky. So what about most arrows caught by head? Yeah. And you just fire arrows at your word. They would just skim off him. Yeah. The roundness, it would never actually get any sort of, you know, connection. Fastest human crab. Could you do that? I'll do that. Form the crab. Can you do that? Just like go bending over backwards and running? No. What would you be good at? What about hamburger stuffing? Oh, right. Carl, let me. All right. In the mouth, you mean? Well, it says the record for stuffing the most regulation sized hamburgers, including buns in the mouth at one time is how many. How many hamburgers with buns in the mouth? This is just. You're not swallowing anything. You've just got stuff. Calm your mouth. You'd be so good. It's because you're shaped with your head. You've got a shape. His head's just like hamburglar. You'd be good at this, man. Yeah. Honestly, you'd be perfect. You look like zippy. And the great thing is your head's empty. So you could get more in there. Do that. What is it? Is it. Could he. Could it. Is it possible? Is it. How many do you think it was? There were three burgers in buns. What do you reckon, Carl? What? How quick he at? He didn't eat them. It's just how many you can stuff in his face. So literally hold them within his cheeks and his mouth, but don't swallow anything. So what, how many. How many burgers? How many burgers did he manage to get into his face? It's a fella. It's not. Yes. About. Not five. No, no, no. Three is the world record. Three, though. It just says regulation size. So we go to McDonald's or Burger King and get just hamburgers and that would. Just a regular burgers. And we'll just. We gotta get Norris McMurdo. We could practice it now and then, if we. If you're a triumphant. Come your car in there. You know, I've got a small throat and that. Yeah, but I don't like it as a kid choking on stuff and I get funny about it. Well, no, just keep your tongue at the back of your mouth. And we have stuff for hamburgers in. No, I don't. Oh, come on, do something, Carl. That is dynamite radio ego. Steve will go and get the hamburgers. I'm gonna pay for them. No, give us the money. I've spent 25 quid in total on a video on a Guinness book of records. That's costing me another four quid. Come on. I'm not doing it. Come on, do it. It's an interesting thing. Come on, you could be in the Guinness Book of. Oh, please phone in if you want Carl to eat burgers. You don't have to swallow them. You can spit it all out. You can be sick of my leg after. Oh, come on. I don't like that. The stretching thing either. It don't stretch. It will stretch. I'll be like the little bloody dog on the Winston Churchill ad. Don't swear. I'm just saying. We apologize to the radio authority. Carl is not only swearing, but he's refusing to do things we come up with. But the radio authority will be happy with me stuffing three burgers in me face doing it. Yeah, we will. Play record. Play record. He's gonna go, you're gonna do it, Kyle, or you're fired. No, actually, he wants that. No, you're gonna do it. Do it, please do it. It'd be great, honestly. Please do it. Please. Meet halfway. No, there's no record for chicken McNuggets. Mental. You are 104.9 in London. XFM. Steve. Hello? Can you hear me? Yes. Can you hear me? Yeah. Where are you? I'm in one of the capital's many burger joints. I'm just about to go up now and order some burgers. Where are you? Where are you in? I'm in McDonald's in Leicester Square. All right, okay. What are you getting? Just, just get. I need to order five regular hamburgers, please. That's all right, sorry, five hamburgers? Yes, yes. You're probably wondering why I'm ordering only five hamburgers, aren't you? And let me tell you why. My friend is going to try and break the world record for putting burgers into his fat, stupid face. What do you make of that? Exciting. Do you wish him good luck? What's your name? Tyre. Thank you very much, tyre. I'll try and get tired to wish you good luck in a minute, Carl. Five should be enough. The world record is what? Three. Three? Yeah. Okay, good. I don't know what. Oh, here we go. How much is that? 345. 345 for five hamburgers. Good, isn't it? It's good value. It is really, isn't it? Really? Yeah. I mean, if there's anyone from hamburgers from McDonald's listening, they'd probably want to give us some free stuff. I thought, Rick, you just wish my friend good luck before you're just on the end of the line. Just say, good luck, Karl. Good luck. There you are. That's the people from McDonald's wishing you good luck, Carl. I'll be back shortly with the burgers. Brilliant. Okay, do you want the pickles left in Eminem? Sing for the moment on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant with five little hamburgers. Five burgers here. Yep. And so, I don't know, how should we begin? Carl, do you want to just look at the size of these burgers? Oh, look, they can see it on webcam, can't they? They can see us stuff in these burgers into your mouth. I'm filming this. Steve, brilliant camcorder. We put this on unseen footage on. The DVD or something, or maybe on the website. On the web. Oh, Carl, what if you broke the record? Okay, Karl, I'm coming around now to. To just monitor this and adjudicate. What's the web? If people want to see this on the webcam, what is it? XFM dot co dot uk. Right. Okay, hold on. Oh, can I. Can I steal? I'm not being funny, right? But I think I have got, like, a bit of a wheat thing. You've got a bit of a what? A wheat allergy. Oh, don't give me that. No, seriously. Me heads. I've been eating a lot of shredded wheat recently and my head's got a bit bigger. I don't think you can let us down, mate. So just. You just gotta put that first. No, I can't. I can't put that like that in my mouth on it. I've got to break it up. I've got to break it up. It doesn't say you can't on the real thing. It doesn't. I can't look. I physically can't try it. I can't look. I'd have to be Jade goody. Seriously. Look. I know, but you're not doing. You're not approaching it, right. That's oh, come on. Go on, that's almost. Keep going, keep going, keep going. That's good work. That's good work. Keep pushing. Get one in at least. Easy. Get one in at least. Get one in, easy. Get one in. Push it, push it. That's one, that's one. Let's go with another one. Let's go. One. Night swimming. Remember night swimming? It's a lovely song in it, Carl. Huh? XFM 104. Nine raise. With me, Steve Merchant. Carl. Disappointing. Disappointing. You couldn't even get one whole burger in your mouth. Kind of, yeah, but there's a bit sticking out. It just looked messy. There was no. You were saying about putting in whole and you. I don't think that's the rule. Okay, suitcase. If you. If you put things in properly, so just get all your clothes and chuck them in. So it's about. I reckon you got to rip it up a bit. Okay, do that then. See how many get in. You got to get in. Two. No, just. Just one. No, pack it in. What? Pack your cheeks first. Honestly, Steve, me ad is swelling a bit because I have got a wheat thing. That'd be good. There'll be more room. All right. Okay, look, Carl is now just sticking in his cheek. Yeah. Don't eat any. You can't swallow any. It's like a hamster. You got to work like a hamster. Stick it in. Come on. He looks like Marlon Brando in the Godfather. Come on, don't lose any yet. All right, pack it in then. Use your fingers to pack it in. Come on, wedge it in like you're grating the bath. I can't do this either. Keep going, keep going, keep going. Don't give up so early. This is part of the problem. You just give up, Carl, quickly. You failed again. It's like your history. O level. Come on, Carl, be a. Come on, do something. Well, succeed at something. Push it in. You've got nearly a half a burger there. Oh, I come round, I come round there. You're chewing. Don't chew. I've got a bit of food. I don't know what he said, but. Is that a whole one? No, it's not. I can see if it's left. Come on, Carl. Come on. Keep working on it. There's so much space in your mouth. I can see it. He's going red. Okay. Okay, we do another one. We're doing another one then. We're doing that. Oh, you're right. Are you gonna be sick? Are you alright? Alright. Oh, God. Should play record. He's making my eyes. Water now. Oh, I'll find a different one for you. Find most drinks eaten in three minutes. I'll go. Do you want to do that? Great. So easy, aren't they? That's easy. Come on. White stripe. Seven nation army. That jumped twice. I apologize for that. You're the producer, Carl. Yeah, it jumped twice. Well, it's not. It's not my fault if people are slipping around because of burgers on the floor. You'll try to squeeze my head when the song's playing. What difference does that make anyway? Right? Don't take any. Right. I've just. I've just got some grapes there. We've. We've counted them out. What's the record then? Okay, well, the most grapes eaten in three minutes. You've got three minutes, Carl, and you've got a beat. Matt hand from the UK, who consumed a total of 133 grapes in three minutes on the 8 November 2001. Right. There's 150 in there. Right? Okay, so you've got three minutes. The rules. You just gotta eat them and swallow them. And it's. It's like call and luke. Right? You gotta just stuff them in and don't choke because I got worried with the burger. That's a good advert for McDonald's in it. Not only was I impressed by the cheapest of them, but he couldn't even get one in his mouth. Yeah. So value for money there. Maybe they'd like to send us some free stuff. Yeah, free stuff or just money? Any. Some money would be good. Next week, Carl, you're eating. Sony Walkman's available for. Right. Right, Carl? Right. I think this is. This is gonna be good. Right? What we're gonna do, right. We got song two by blur setup. We know that's two minutes. So we can play that because that'd be boring radio here in Kyle choke, wouldn't it, for three minutes. So when I say go, Karl. Right, I'm gonna go right on the minute. Right. You've got. Have a handful of grapes. And you've got a press song, too, by Blair. When we come back, you'll be stuffing your fat. Hold on. You have to do that. How can you. Can you work the buttons? You cannot touch the grapes until the opening. Yeah, but when the. When the blur to when song two stops, can we just press up the fader so you. Because you'll be stuck. Don't worry. We're almost. We got. Let's go. If we go. Okay. Any second there. Okay. Right. Okay. Three, two, one, go. And he's off that's good work from Carl. Now. He's just. He's approaching it cautiously to begin with. Cautiously. And he's just easy. Come on. Don't make him laugh. Quick. Keep going, Cole. Come on. Don't. Come on. What happened? Did he just throw up? No, don't make him laugh. Oh, come on. We can make. We can make wine. Come on, Karl. You're doing so well, mate. Come on. I want to go. Come on. Why are you making him laugh? That was a world record attempt. He's over the. Keep going. Come on. You got 25 seconds. Come on. Oh, I think that was. That was a shame, actually, because you were doing well, but something went wrong. I know. And I think those are bigger grapes than the ones I've seen before. They're quite big grapes. Look so despondent. Come on, car. 8 seconds. Just a few more. Five. Come on. What's the matter? Two, two, one. It's all over, Karl. It's all over. Better count how many you did because you can get good at this. We can get good at this over the weeks. I think that was a fairly pitiful attempt, actually. I really thought you had a. It's interesting, actually. These are harder records than you might think. Yeah, I know. 6810. How do you feel after that record breaking attempt? I'm not happy with that. What are you not happy about? The fella who did it. Was he in hospital and just had loads of grapes and was bored? You can sure he wasn't producing a radio program, that's for sure. Well, to be fair, neither of you. What, uh. What was tricky about it? What did you find hard? I think having Ricky standing over me. Yeah. Sort of shouting, go on. Isn't normal. But did that. So that wasn't. He hasn't eaten any. Hold on, that's 50 left. That's quite. That's quite a poor attempt then, by the seam of it. Would you think about trying to maybe do that again in a couple of weeks? Would you do some practice and try that again? Leave it. Leave it for the experts. And there was. I know it's a tricky point. Maybe sort of. When you had about 50 seconds to go, you seem to be spewing things into the bin. What was that again? Mainly Ricky standing over me. 88 left. Okay, so what's the mental arithmetic there? Because we put how many in was 150. So he had 88 left. 62. God, you're only at 62. What's the matter with you, Carl? There's people start you at 62. That is rubbish. That's disappointment. Well, you so you failed on two world record attempts. 62. And the records are. That is rubbish. What were you doing? Oh, yeah, but like I said, I've got a small throat. I can't. I can't drink. A drink quick. Ever since the Mister freeze pops when I was six that I nearly choked on, I nearly died on. I can't go back. It'd be like asking, I don't know, someone who got run over to play frogger or something. That was frogger. What, you mean real life? Well, just a computer game. Brings back memories, don't it? And I can't do that. What does Frogger. Does Frogger get one over? Yeah. Do you know who he reminded me of, apart from Hamburglar and zippy and all that, when he was mentioning those grapes? Because the shape of his head, it looked like a game of Pac man. Yeah. As he was getting to him, it looked like it. There was a board game version of Pac man. Was there? I mean, the only thing that Pac man had was the fact that it was on a computer and it was a little face eating things. But imagine that as a board game. But there's. There's board games of, like, things that you don't need board games for. Yeah, it's like there's board games of charades. Do you know what? You don't need that. It's like parlor games. Board games of let's watch the telly. Yeah, let's. Let's play sit around and it's all like 1999. You don't need it. New from Mattel. A stick simply run along, clanking it against a fence or a metal grate. It's fence stick in the picture. Oh, Nan. Nan. That's my stick. I'll tell you what, that's my fence stick. Do you know, I saw in there in a shot recently, the board game of cold feet, the tv show. You are John Thompson. Yeah. Go back. Yeah. Drink. Eight points. Songs a phrase. Songs a phrase. Nicely done. Right, we'll get this going. How do you feel, Karl, again? Disappointment. Disappointment, probably to your family and friends. Well, I don't think that we get that gutted, to be honest. Because it's a big tease. People love that. It's one of the hot new. We've got one more thing for you to eat. No, I'm not doing any more. Right, song's a phrase. Next. That was rubbish, that half hour rubbish. That's great. Roots. The seed XFN 104.9. I bet that is a record of eating grapes whilst djing. Possibly. I'm assuming if there's any listeners out there that have a record breaking attempt they'd like to see Carl undertake in future weeks, they should email in. I think Jono has got that one. Right. What have we got, then? That's. That's the silly side. Now let's get on to the proper show. Song's a phrase. Yeah. Should we do that? Onto the classy stuff? Yeah. Do you want to do the prizes first? Right, now, then. Where are they? Here they are. I haven't seen these, but I'm excited as ever. All right, we have a t shirt there. Arbitrary t shirt that you have probably stolen off of someone. What does it say? Is it the red hot. The red hot chili peppers? So that's not too bad. A big t shirt there on DVD list. Should you be giving this away? This looks like it's the film. Don't say a word. Yeah. And it's. It doesn't have all the proper packaging. It's literally the disc. The DVD disc. Just loose. So enjoy that. The current album from Oasis, Heathen chemistry DVD on DVD, the life of mammals, the complete series, the David Attenborough recent DVD, that walking with Caveman, which I think is a DVD's all currently on tv, isn't it? Well, there you go. Also the x list, which is a good new accompanition double CD compilation from XFM with loads of stuff on there, including nerd, snoop doggy dog, athlete, all. Sorts go on in car. Not bad, actually. Nice one. So, yeah, it's a phrase that's been said at some point or said a lot on the show. We've had, like, airy chinese kid. We went back to my mom, had wind for five minutes and that today we're looking at, my neighbor had a horse in a house. Right. If you remember, we were talking about that probably about a year and a half ago now. Yeah, yeah, of course people. Of course people remember. They've been talking about ever since. Go. I imagine. Yeah. Well, it's famous. It's a world famous phrase. My neighbor had a horse in her house. Right. So this is this week's songs, a phrase. And what I've done is. I've got songs with those words in that make up that sentence. Yeah. You got email in Ricky Gervaisfn dot co dot UK. There's six different songs. Right? You email him with what? I don't know. There is six. Me neighbour, add horse in house. Is it really that sentence, my neighbor. Had a horse in her house. It does work. Honestly. It works, yeah. Okay. Don't bother explaining it, just play it. Yeah. So where's the. There it is. We're just gonna head boys in a house right? What in God's name was that? Yeah, name the six songs. Are we naming the artists or the songs? Either artists. Anyone who gets anything can get a prize artist. Here we go. That's tricky Carl. That's very hard. Once more. Email in Ricky dot gem. Dot co dot uk I'll give it another letdown. Another letdown brilliantness. Now can you just say that after I've just been stuffing grapes in my face? Well in fact you found you didn't get one burger in right even when you tried to chop it up. There's three, right? So that's it. Steve at the goodness of his heart went to McDonald's. Okay, I got some grapes. You at 62 that's got nothing to. Do with this though. This is my game show here. Bob Oleness didn't say yeah, blockbusters is good but I never see him eating grapes so this is a different thing. Forget that. Right, here's the clips again. These are clips. You know I said I was gonna turn over a new leaf and not criticize your ideas. I think it's the end of this one, mate. Oh he's done it all done. It's atrocious Ricky doctor vase at XFM dot co dot UK if you've got any idea year. Dandy Warhols we used to be friends that is Carl's favorite record of the year he gets one play a year and he chose that. It's all right but I mean that favorite track, isn't it? He played that, that was, that was Carl's choice. Just something new on XFM 104.9 don't worry, we've got some really good stuff coming up later if you from the. Seventies you might like it. You see that he's getting too cocky any arrogant it's sort of like he's. I mean we try and we've tried giving him something in his life he's got, you know, I mean he's is he comes in and tells us this, this sob story of just like a trail of failures and we said carl, come under our wing right? He just started picking up on him a few other people and he does that. He fails at the burgers, he fails at the grapes. He will not trust us with, you know, what we want to do. I don't know what more we can do. It's like I've saved a mouse from a, from a cat's jaws and it turned around and bit me. Yeah. Yeah. That is a brilliant analogy. It's a bit like we were trying to give you something that you could care about, that you could be passionate about, that would somehow give a meaning to your life. You would be in the Guinness Book of Records alongside Bubble. Bubble filed. Do you want to be bubble? Do you want to be bubble? Or do you want to be the bloke with a milk bottle on his head? Who's in there? The guy who ate the watches? Yes. Now I've got an idea, Carl, because you're getting all stressed out. I don't know what it is. You're getting funny. I don't know what. I don't know what. Wow. You say that midweek. I don't think I know anyone else. So it's just you on that. So I thought maybe we could, all three of us, go away to a little health farm for a weekend, just get, like a triple room. And why? You've just reminded me. Because you've been annoying me, Steve. Started getting on your case, you know, sort of ganging up on me. I'll tell you now, Steve, I just forgot. Remember a couple of weeks ago, you said to me that my pub team, pub quiz team is rubbish? Yeah. Right. Well, it doesn't matter anymore because you're not part of it this time. That's bad. That's bad. Because it's interesting you say that, Carl. Carl, you say that, because I tell you this. I found someone. I found someone, mate, who could be filling that tricky fifth member. I wanted to test them out this week, mate, on your team. On your team. Test that on your team. Because I'll tell you what this is like, I don't know if you feel familiar with. Paul inch used to play with Man United, right? But everyone used to say he's the governor, right? Even the players used to call him the governor, right? And Alex Ferguson at Man United was like, I'm not having this. I'm in charge here. And he got rid of him. And that's what's happened. You. You were moaning the other week, saying, your team's rubbish. You don't know what you're doing. Yeah, well, let's see how you do on your own. Right? He's turned any. I'll be honest, Karl, I'd like to be on your team. Well, sorry, Paul, inside. What can I do to get back on your team? It's not happening. I've already filled you. Don't let him have the upper hand, Steve. No, no, no, no, wait. A minute. I tell you what always annoys me, though. Ricky spends most of the show slagging you off, right? Having a go at you, annoying you in the week, squeezing your head, making. You eat burgers, right? But you always take out on me. I'm the one who always gets the insults. I'm the one who's now relegated from your team. Why? You see, this is the thing. You're just as bad as him. Really? Because you're siding against me. Because you know that I'm willing to take it. You what? The truth of it is this. You know that Ricky Gervais is keeping you. He's keeping you in burgers and grapes, metaphorically speaking. He's the one that's got you in Heat magazine. I just spat all over your new Christmas book of records. You see? Get me a tissue. He's just squirted tea. Laughing all over your records. Are you made me not gonna get. The flack for that. No, it's because you made me laugh when I was drinking. Because you went and it made me laugh and I smiled. I just think it upsets me that you. That you never. You never pick on Ricky. You never, ever go in. Because, you know, he's the one who's raised your profile and made you a little bit of a celebrity. We've missed one here. Using his teeth ramen. Andy Appan. Right. Husk to toe coconut. He did what? He husk to coconut. He's the fastest coconut husker in the world. What does that mean? I don't know. He pulls huskers. He pulls husks. What's a coconut husky? He pulls the curse off again. Look at Carl, just with his head down. Carl, come on. What's the matter? Does that cost me 20 quid? I know. Well, I'll see you. All right. I'll sit up here. All over. The world's smallest man. Why have they stood him next to the world's biggest man? Right, I'm in a bad mood now. Oh, dear. So you haven't got a team. Just cut, Steve. I'll sort you out. Come to me. I'll sort you out. Where? Someone who would help you win this week. Week, Carl. And I was going to tell you about it. And now, Steve, you can be on. My team this week. And I know something about the quiz that Carl doesn't know, so I'll tell you. I just think that it's so ungrateful. So ungrateful. Right. Song's a phrase. Just give it a couple more plays. Just email him we'll pick a winner soon. Ricky Gervais fm dot co dot uk. Well, this isn't. This is rubbish this week. No one knows it because it's rubbish. Steve was right. There's six songs there, so if you know what they are, just. That's the end of that. I think that's the end of songs of phase emailing. I think that's the last week for that. Why don't you give us some monkey news? Is it monkey? Come on, monkey news? No, no, it's a great track. Cheer up, Carl. Waiting for an alibi within. Lizzie doesn't have to be new. It's brilliant. Oh, Einstein wasn't new when he came up with the greatest theory ever. Oh, die. Hey. Oh, you're not new. You're not new. Waiting for an alibi by thin Lizzie on XFM 104.9. Right, okay. Just. This is. Oh, all the. With all the trauma in the world, I thought we'd come under a little bit and he's just brought it right down. A little mankind twat whinging. No, but I mean, do you know what I mean? He's got to go at you. He's thrown you off his team. I'm devastated by that. That was. You know, that was the one thing I was looking forward to this week, to be fair. You were looking forward to telling him you were taking over the team. So it sort of poetic justice. I was blown up in your face, to be fair. True. I was trying to squeeze him out of his own company. Yeah, you were going to try and get him out of his team. It was a hostile takeover and they sort of. They clubbed together. To be honest with you, there's normally three regulars on his team. I got two of them on my side, one of which was his girlfriend. So I only had to work on him to try and get him to resign. And we'd have been away still, you know, we should give the prices away. Yeah, well, this is. This has been dreadful, that. This thing. We started off well with him trying to force burgers in his mouth and then he'd come up with this tat. I mean, this is. This is the end of this because it's. I mean, it was shoddy to start with. Now that the other couple. Well, this is not. I'm just saying. This is what I was saying in the pub yesterday. When you try to be sick on me, like I was saying, come up with new ideas. If you don't like them but you diss them on air, well, it's just disappointing. Isn't it? What's that? I was disappointed when I was choking before. We were disappointed as well. Yeah, you didn't try. You didn't try with the grapes. You were just, like, chewing. You meant to just throw them in and swallow them. Song's a phrase. It was six songs. It sounded like this. Songs. There we had Lionel Richie. My destiny for my tricky neighbor. Oh, that's XFM. My neighbor was space. Space. Neighborhood had ariconic junior. Had to be you. A horse. Horse. America. America. In was Lisa Sonsfield with pathetic in all the right places. Anyone get that? No, no one got that. That was point this. All right, well, the most. The most anyone got was three. And we're gonna give it to Deborah. And that's possibly Deborah and Kate. They got at least three of those, so. Okay, well, then there's prizes on the way. That's the end of that. So that's. There. No cheapest chimps. None of that anymore. What have you got left? You got the film to do? Let's see what you've done with the film. Hang on. I'd love to have some monkey news, though. Go on, then. Got any monkey news? Yeah, I've got some monkey news. Come on, then. No, rick, come on, cheer up. Well, it's. It's just sort of like. He moans that he's got too much time on his hands and he comes up with that. Okay, shite. Monkey news. The jingle, please. Oh, Jim, fancy that. Monkey news. Quite a lot of stuff going on. There was a few bits in that Guinness Booker records book that cost me 20 quid. Yeah. That's not news, is it? They printed that probably last September, so that. There's one in there. New music. New music. New. New monkey news from last September. You're a lord. Come on. Waster. Police. Ricky. Monkey news, right? There was this. This monkey in a zoo in Brazil, right? And this little man monkey. Little woman monkey. And you're a scientist, aren't you? Gone. And they said the people in charge were like, oh, wouldn't it be good if they had kids? Brilliant. Right? So anyway, the chimps used to stand sort of, you know, they'd have the little caves each, and you sort of. These are sort of lean on the fence, having a bit of a chat and stuff with each other. The equivalent sort of thing. Yeah. So anyway, they were getting on a storm and, like, the zookeepers were like. Can you hear that? Cheapest chimps this week, hopefully. It was fascinating. Yeah, just. Just gossiping. Einstein. Use. This week. Come on. That was from last September. So they were. There was, you know, stood there having a chat and the zookeepers were like, I wonder if they're ever gonna, you know, have kids and that. Yeah. Anyway, it went on for ages. You know this. Just chatting. Nothing. No sort of action. So what the zookeepers did was they. They said, I know they love. Are we letting that go? They were just chatting. You know what I mean? I mean, just doing whatever monkeys do. Okay, so. So, yeah, so the zookeepers were like, yeah, I wonder when they're gonna, you know, have some kids. Anyway, what they decided to do. To sort of do. To egg them on. Yeah. Bottom. But one of them, a suit, won a wedding dress. Right, keep going. No, I'm not. Shut up. Jerry's. Fade him down if he's gonna interrupt. They got. They got married. So they got married. Yeah. They got married. Right. What? That's the end of it. This is why. Don't fight. That's the end of monkey news. That's the end of monkey news. Don't do that again. You've got no features left. Why don't you like that? This is not a story. It's about two chimps chatting, which doesn't happen. The zookeepers going, I wonder if they're gonna ever have kids. And, come on, they got married. That's the end of the story. What are you talking about? Hang on. Just calm down. Let me just check that you didn't make a mistake there and didn't lose out. What do you mean? Wait. He may have just left out a fundamental piece of information. What, the story that would have made it into a story. Right. Just check. Let me just check the facts. So they. They bought them wedding outfits? They were married. Did they propose to each other or did they, were they just forcibly courageous? And then what was the outcome once they got married? What happened? They fell in love. Yeah. What? It's not a marriage, Carl, because it's not a real marriage. I don't know what you've got in your head. It's like the head of Homer Simpson. I'd go in there and there'd be a wedding reception and there'd be a couple of fights and they'd be talking about stuff. They got married. They fell in love. Did they have children? Um. They're not back off the honeymoon yet. Satisfaction. New single. Yeah. Xfm. Quick. Play it. Right. We've waited three weeks. We are gonna play it. I don't care whether we're late. We were late in because there was news. So play it. Which film are you in this week. Looking at silence alums. Right, play it. Just play it. Have we got a question? No. Should Kyle carry on? Play it. Right. Silence the lambs. The bit where Jodie Foster is having a chat. Good evening, Clarice. All right? Started. Come and see you. How very thoughtful. Don't mind me popping in, though, do you? It's just no one else is in. Interested in the sort of things I like talking about. People will say we're in love. Well, say what they want. Do you hear the. You hear the show last week? We were talking about gay people, if they should have their own toilets or not. Stuff. That was good. It's all right. Got a good, good debate going. Enjoy doing the show. Favorite part of me week, really. Just talking about weird stuff and that. Oh, Clarice, your problem is you need to get more fun out of life. I have a lot of fun in my life, you know, come and see you and spend a lot of time on the Internet looking up weird stuff. Reading something about a hairy chinese kid. There's another thing. There's a fella who. No arms and legs, he's known as a pillar man. Everything you need to find him is right there in those pages. Bizarre magazine. Yeah, I get this. The Harry chinese kid. What annoys me is he could sort it out. He could just have a shave, couldn't he? No, he cuts. Does he? Well, use some. Some of that emacs stuff. Don't be getting funny with me just because you're in a bit of a mood. Right. You know, you shouldn't eat people. Your eyes are bigger than your belly. I've always said that. So, see you later. Interesting. Atmospheric. Moody. And the question is, okay, how about this? How many films have been made featuring the character Hannibal Lecter? How many films? No, they can email in. They'll have time. Do you care? I don't care. No, exactly. Ricky Gervais, XFM dot co dot uk. If you can be bothered. If you're interested in what you want, a 499 copy on VHS of silence. Dissing that as well. Carl. What? Is it that annoying. But that's it for this week. But remember what happened when it. No, it's not. It's nine minutes to three. How can I. No, no. How can that be? It's nine minutes to three. What's he doing? Is he playing record? Carl, what can I do to get back on your quiz team? You're not gone. Right, songbird. I just. Right. Send Carl a little present. Send him some essential oils or summer or. I mean, a little lavender pillow or just a little. Little message? Send him a little message. Tell him it's all worth it. He's getting all grumpy, aren't you? I just get sick of it, that's all. It's not worth going through the stress for 30 quid every Saturday. You lying little. You get more than 30 quid. Not much more. Anyway. Steve, who's the winner? The winner is Mike McNulty. He correctly answered the fact that there were four films featuring Hannibal. It's a downer. Now he's a downer. I think it was you, actually. I mean, I don't know, Carl. I'm not. It's not like I'm just trying to win myself a place on your team, but I actually felt that Ricky was really. I gave him grapes. I thought you. I thought he was. Was discourteous, if that's a word. I thought he was rude, aggressive, unpleasant, as one person emailed in a dickhead. So. Someone also said you were fat and talentless, so I don't like those erasers who do that sort of thing. But one of them said you were really, really annoying watchers for that. But you said they didn't know what you were wearing. So back next week. What did you say? Cheers for that music.",
