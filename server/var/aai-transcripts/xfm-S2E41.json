  "text": "Well, I know that must be some people's favorite record, Steve. Well, it's only one of mine. Thunder Road, Bruce Springsteen. I won't hear a bad word said against the boss. A lot of people dismiss him, as you said in the past, as being some kind of stadium rocker, but you can't listen to a song like that and not be moved. Surely, Carl, it's alright. Yeah, brilliant. A passionate man. Yeah. So, Carl. No, no, no, that's right. Certain songs alike that was. That was all right. Didn't sound anything. It wasn't Bruce Springsteen. If someone new came out saying like that, I'd go, yeah, it's all right, sure, you know, I mean. Yeah. You're a regular Simon Cowell, aren't you? I don't know if I like music as much as I used to now. That's what happens when you work in it, because it was Danny minogues on the telly. No, when you're working a sweet factory and you don't. You don't nick the Mars bars after a couple of months. Yeah, yeah. Donna Mano's on the telly in the week. Right. And she was doing. Doing a medley. Yeah. Why do people do them? Well, to try and get all the hits. I know, I know what you mean. Yeah, but who's that busy that they only got time to listen to a full album or. It's like a meal in peel form. Yeah, well, I like most of Danny Minogue's hits, but I don't like the whole song. Yeah, exactly. So if you want to just like, pop the best bits down 30 seconds, put them all together. Yeah. I've got a stars on 45 record from the seventies. Remember those? Yeah, stars on 45. But it's that, like you say. I mean, listen, this one had kind of. It would be a snatch of Stevie Wonder followed by the mash theme, followed by Layla. Just the intro. Well, we do a bit of that, don't we, though? That's what djing isn't. It's a bit of everything. But we play the whole song, don't we? Often, yeah, we're better, aren't we, Kyle? So what do you want to talk about today? Look at the list. Yeah, it's got described looks. That's our list. So this is a very amusing sort of link about describing your look. I don't know. What's this? I don't remember this. No, I just was thinking, like, you know, everyone's got an idea in the red. Right? Well, don't open yourself up to criticism. Go on. Yeah, everyone's got. Do you know what I mean? Everyone's got an idea of what they look like and stuff. If someone wanted to know what I look like or what Ricky look like or what you look like, Steve, if that. Yeah. What would use to describe yourself, do you know? I mean, we're not really. I don't understand. What do you mean? Well, like, someone who doesn't know us, we've got to describe and we've. What's. What's the game? To hopefully get some sort of interpersonal language going so, you know, they've got the same image as you to a certain extent. Just thinking, if I was to meet Steve in a restaurant, you. Right. Nothing untoward going on. We're just hanging out. Yeah, yeah. Who's paying? Because, I mean, is it expensive? Go Dutch. Go Dutch. Go Dutch. I mean. Right. So I say to you, I'll see you at eight, right? Yes. In this restaurant. I turn up at the door, it's a bit of a posh place, right? There's Steve Merchant in. Yeah. And the waiter sort of goes, I don't know. What does he look like? Right. And where's he from? Just a little french fella. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And what does he look like? So I had the thing I pick up on first. Tall. Tall lad. Tall, yeah. And then he goes, oh, you know, we got lots of tall people, right? And I go, big eyes. Big eyes. And then he'd go, yeah, he's over there. I'll be honest with you. I mean, you can have dinner and. You can buy me dinner. I'm not sure you're gonna get anywhere with me. Just like me. Oh, I'm not slagging you off, though. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Using what comes to mind. And can it. And can I just. Can I assume that they know, like, could I say, like, easiest for me? Would I say, looks like Regvani from on the buses? Would they understand that? Can I use sort of like. This waiter? So I go, oh, yes, regret. Yeah, he went german towards the end. See, I describe you more, Rick, I think, as I would imagine. I'd say, have you ever seen that Johnny Vegas on the tennis? Yeah. Imagine he was inflatable and you just let out a little bit of air. At least that's what Ricky would look like. As opposed to, like, you know, pumping harder. Yeah, yeah. Okay, well, that's quite cow. I describe as, you know, those little red monkeys that you see on wildlife programs. They look there in the trees and they scream when they see a shave that. Just shave one of those little red monkeys and put some sort of, you know, old sort of Manchester gear on it, maybe. Yeah. You know, I mean. Yeah. And some baggy jeans. I'd like to see the way it would react to that. Yeah. He's got a picture of monkey then. He's got a picture. He's shaved, it's got no hair, dressed like some kind of manx guy. He's over there. Yeah, he's over there. Carl's over there. That's what I do. So now, coming up, the verb after that amusing link about gay handkerchiefs. Really looking forward to this. Lucky man by the verve on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington. Carl, what's the problem with guy anchors? You were. You played Bruce Springsteen last week? Yeah. Right, yeah. And you said he had got a load of trouble on his hands when he had a hanky in his back pocket. Did I say that on air or. Well, we were just saying that famously on the COVID of the born to run born in the USA album. It's just him, isn't it? With just his backside, basically. A red handkerchief looking. Well, I just. Well, I did it for research purposes, for this amazing link. He had a red handkerchief, I think, in his right hand pocket. And apparently that signifies homosexuality. Apparently. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, I thought it was. Which way you take? I don't know. These myths aren't exactly. I don't even know if. No, well, I read up about it. Okay, right. Just for a search. And it's all sort of, you know, they've got all different colored ankies. Are they? Yeah. Right. And it depends what pocket you put it in. Yes. Well, so you've got like the different colors, different pockets. Yeah, sorry, how many variations are there? Different pockets is what? Your back pocket? Your right back pocket. But what do they mean? What do you mean? Well, what do they signify? You can't just tell us they signify so much. What do they signify? Well, some. Some stuff that we don't really want to talk about, to be honest. What sort of stuff that gays are into. Wait, so what do you mean? Marvel Streisand records. Yeah. Eurovision. No, like a couple of things that were there that I know we can mention. He said something about I love what. He thinks he can't mention. I love it. Decency. What is this, 1956? No, no, no. But I mean, it isn't just, you know, having it away. I never found. He didn't want to offend, but he's offended a lot more people by saying they get up to some weird stuff. Right. In your opinion? Yeah. What do you mean? No, but don't. If it's. If there is something that I don't know about that it's like, you can't say on the radio, but what do you mean weird stuff? Well, one of them. Right. If you've got red anki. Right. Yeah. In your right pocket. Like Bruce. Yeah. That's exactly what Bruce had. Yeah. Right. Well, apparently then Bruce is an armpit freak. An armpit freak? No, that's very specific. Go, seriously? Well, what? Okay. Right. Okay. What else is there? Sorry. Is there some kind of homosexual body that sat down and came up with this at some point? We said we got. Well, this is getting crazy. You've got, like, a blue handkerchief in your top breast pocket. And what that means you need to sit down is I'm gonna summit, figure out what it means. Yeah. It's just that you're not. You're not free from it either. So if you were to go in, like, a gay bar. Yeah. Which, you know, you might do if you're straight anyway, because there are, you know, good. Good places, I think. Mm hmm. You can't actually go in there if you've got a cold because every colored hanky represents something. Right. So if I was to go in, add a bit of a sniffle, I could get into all sorts of trouble for that. Marks and Spencer's white linen hanky. That means you like to be tied up and whipped. Yeah. There was another one. Armpit freak. We've covered. Armpit freak is done. Armpit freak. Right. Okay. Yeah. Well, there was just one other thing, like a blue and white one is if you're into sailors. To sailors. Yeah. If you have a little blue and white anky that's in your left pocket. Right. Blue and white equals sailor. So I wanted to ask you something, you know, but again, we've got to be careful here. You know, when you wouldn't leave the building, that was on fire because you were. You were standing proud. Hang on, we need this. Some people now don't know what you're talking about. You, Carl, you're on holiday. Yeah. On holiday in Tenerife, right? Yeah. You'd had a moment of intimacy with your girlfriend. Yeah. A knock on the door. You had to stop and get up. You peeked around the door. It was a fireman saying, get out. But you didn't want to leave because you added. Yeah, it was little. Yeah. But what I don't understand is you maintained that while looking at a spanish man dressed as a fireman. Yeah. Is that true? Is that. Is that the fact you maintained. I'm sorry? You maintained, you know, arousal whilst looking at a gentleman dressed as a fireman? No, no. Is that. These are the facts now undisputed. What did you maintain? I'm not a machine, though. I mean, I can't turn it on. Turn it off. I just thought talking to a fireman, you'd have probably lost it. I don't know. But you didn't. No, but the other thing was, I mean, I was talking to Susan about it again. Right? What are you talking about? I said, oh, it just cropped up. Right. Yeah. And the dilemma was, you see, I wanted to try and make sure that it was a proper fire because that was the last condom we had. Right. So it would have ruined the night. So I didn't want to, like. It was like, you know, what's going on? Is it. Do we need to get out? Yeah. Is it a proper fire? Yeah. And you talking to this man in uniform, was he. What'd he look like? Was he quite. Was he good looking? Did he look like Ricky Martin? Was he good looking? Was he good looking in his uniform? I can't remember. Can't remember. Did you have a moustache? Better player record, haven't we? Is this bringing it back? What? Look uncomfortable. What. Did you just switch this on with your hand? Inflaming lips. And that's fight. Test lips and test lips on M. We were talking in there about homosexual people and I'm sure we'll move on to other topics. But I just mentioned I was talking to a friend of mine in the week, Rufus, and he overheard. He pieced together that, you know, sometimes if you overhear a conversation, you can piece together what's going on. Yeah. You know, and it sort of transpired from what he can, what he could make out that one gay guy had just realized or just found out that his gay boyfriend had maybe been having an affair and was on the phone and had called this person the third party. The other one was crying, wasn't it? The other one was crying in tears. Obviously. They just had a big argument about it. And all he heard on the phone was the guy saying, in very kind of earnest tones, I'm going to do everything in my power to destroy you. But I just like to think what that was. Where was he? No more guest list to gay. I am going to slash your diesel jeans with a pair of scissors. They're listening now. I know. I mean, it's probably an emotional time for them. Yeah, but they probably don't think we're talking about them. No, not. It's probably happened quite a lot this week. Well, possibly. I do know quite a lot of gay people, but they do. They do jump about when it comes to partners. Rightly. Freedom of speech. Yeah, let the man speak. No, I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I mean, it's quite. You know, they don't. You know, if they get bored, they move on, on that. Which is fair enough, but they do. And they piece this together and they go out like, don't they? Well, we've covered that and we've done that. How have you know how we covered that? His favorite record is killing a Georgie. And he went, at the end of the record, he went, see? But how late was it? Yeah. If he'd have been sort of going out a decent time, that wouldn't happen. I mean, Steve, they're always getting ready to go out that past one in the morning. You're asking for trouble. Yes. Incidentally, I should just point out that. Oh, dear. That we've had an email. I've lost it here now. But anyway, it was one of our listeners saying that we've slightly embarrassed ourselves because, of course, Bruce Springsteen on the COVID of Born in the USA doesn't actually have a handkerchief in his back pocket. It's actually a red baseball cap. So I don't know if that also counts. I don't know if it's any coloured object. Into heads. Into little round heads. If Bruce Springsteen. And he's obviously not gay, but if he said, all right, Kyle, just, you know, little cuddle, would you turn down Bruce Springsteen? Yeah. Well, no. Why? Just like, all right, mate. You know, you hug your mates, don't you? If Bruce said, all right, Carl, I like your show. Love your head. Little cuddle. Little cuddle a mate cuddle. No, I just hear what you're doing. Just say, look, we're a couple of old friends, Bruce Springs and I've got those great songs. I like what you're doing. Let's cuddle. Let's have a little. All right. Thing is, right, Steve, right, you know, he likes to squeeze me out. He likes to squeeze me out. Yeah. He had an old mate over this week. He's got a similar shaped head, apparently, as mine. Yeah, right. He's hardly gave me a call or anything because he was busy with this other fella's head. Oh, you feel quite bad about that. This is a better head to squeeze, I tell you why. Because he shaves his every day, right? He's got the same sort of problem. Shaves every day, right? Problem, no, no. And it's because he's had it. Share the time. Like Carl's is sort of come through a bit long at the side. Sometimes it looks a bit unkempt. Towards the end of the week, I've seen there's a little. There's a couple of little pimples under there. But I really have to do it. Just like get there, slap my hands in it, squeeze it. With this one, I can sort of get my finger. I mean, I get my. Really, you know, you like, you like a gay. The way you jump about from head to head. Just saying, right? Still coming up, man. What we got? Coming up? We got rockbusters. Is any monkey news this week? It's been a problem. Why? It's not much has been going on this week. What? In the monkey world? In the monkey world. I don't know if they've caught on to the fact that they're getting coverage. They're keeping their behavior hush hush, being a bit careful. But I found something. Have you got rockbusters? It's your last chance, don't forget. Is it good? These rockbusters got some good prizes, Steve. We'll look at them in a bit. Cheeky freak of the week. Of the week. Got that? Yeah. So what deform is it this week that you're with? Keep listening. I didn't really appreciate the stones when I was younger. I was always a Beatles fan, but now I can't really listen to the Beatles. I just. It's like I've used them up. It's about five tracks I like. Yeah, the stones just get better and. Better and now it's brilliant. And the. The video's so good. Amazing. From 1981, that was waiting on a friend from the Rolling Stones. What we got? We got more fun coming up, I imagine. Yeah. Cheeky freak of the week. An amusing story about inflatable testing. We've already given you half an hour talking about gay people. Who knows what else will be coming up? Yeah, big market. Out of time by Blair on XFM 104.9. All right, Carl, what are you thinking? Stinking stuff. You're an enigma, aren't you? I would just say hello to. We've got an american listener, apparently. Karen, I thought that might fill up 4 seconds. We're not struggling, are we? No, just consult the list of music. Wet ones. Screwball shop train. Cheeky freak. Ronin. What was Ronan. Ronan, I just was telling you the other day about, you know, that. That song that he does loving every day is if it's your last one. Right? Yeah. I'm just thinking. He's saying that as if, like, I'll have a good day, but I reckon if you knew it was your last day, I don't think you'd be in the mood to do anything. Yeah, but what's true, but, well, yeah. I think the point is that it's living. They like it to last, so. God, imagine if it was every day, like, last. Right, let's go mental. And the good thing is, we've got tomorrow, so. He's got the best of both worlds. That's what Ronan saying. He's saying, cram it in, because it might be the last. I think it's more like it's the not knowing, isn't it? Live every day. See, I'd be. See, I actually be happy if. If I never knew when I was gonna die and I was definitely gonna die. I'm asleep. What a brilliant life you'd have. Do you know? I mean, what, so you don't get. An illness, but one night you go. To bed and I know that if you knew you were gonna die in sleep, I never knew when you're gonna die. It wouldn't matter if it was tomorrow or 30 years time, it wouldn't matter, would it? Yeah. I've lost you haven't. I've lost you somewhere I can't see. I thought that was pretty easy, all that. I said, die in your sleep and not know when you died. There was no high concept there. No sleight of hand. Linguistically, what? Where did I lose you? I think you lost him on sleight of hand. Linguistically, you've lost him again. I think that's the way I'd want to go. I don't. I don't want to know about it. That's why I don't go to the doctors or anything. Brilliant approach. And he remember him saying he's gonna die of cancer cuz he doesn't check his balls. He doesn't like the feel. Of course. Of course. What do they feel like, your balls? Like a. Like a wet chamois leather. With two marbles. Two kumquats in a wet, shammy leather. No, but I just. Why are they wet? Sweaty? No, they're not. I'm just saying smooth. Are they smooth? Yeah. Because a chamois leather's smoother when it's. Do you shave them? No I don't. In case a fireman pops around, you want to look your best. It looks like your head. The fireman pops around. There you are. And he goes, oh nice. Smooth. So you never go to the doctors? What? Even I don't, I don't like it. But if you found some buboes under your arm or something, you. I'd wait for a bit and I'd say to Susan, what do you think of that? Just see if it develops into play. Well, yeah, because you know, don't you. Old bandages around your head and a bell. Suzanne, how can you get me a bell? Exactly. Brilliant. There was this kid at our school we took the piss out of for the, basically the rest of his time there because when he was about eleven someone said, how would you want to die? Right. We do have the drowning, fire, all that. He said, I want to die of old age in my mother's arms. My mother's arms. What? Getting off with her. Die of old age. Old cheat. Brilliant. I want to die of old age with my nan in my mouth. Yeah. All in the same bed. Oh dear. So if you, if you, if it was the last day, if you had one day to live, okay, what would you do with your day? Now let's assume that you're not, you're not in a state of ill health. There's not much you can do. It's just the end of the world. There's not much you can do. That's what we're asking you. It's the last day of your life. It depends, doesn't it? If we're all in the same boat. If someone says, oh, unlucky without bitterness, like, oh, we accidentally expose you to some radiation boys and you got a day. Or if it was like there's a meteor coming this way, we're all in the same boat. Think it would be different? It depends whether it's, you know, I. Do the same thing. I'd steal a car and go joy riding, but like go mental. I'd be smashing stuff. I'd be knocking people over for a laugh. I'm going crazy. Be like grand theft auto. Extraordinary, brilliant driving through parts. I tried to play it seriously with about ten minutes. I was just going around areas I knew people over. Yeah, I don't think I'd want to do that much. Seriously. You can watch telly because you might not know the thing ends. Yeah. You could watch 24. Can you had a day? Yeah. On DVD. Well, I mean let's be honest, you. Let's say you, you know, you could take all the money out of your bank account. You can fly anywhere in the world, you can do whatever you want. Well, not a long flight. Well, no, but you've got your girl. You wouldn't make it, would you? Why wouldn't you go to the monkey sanctuary down in Cornwall and just run around cuddling as many monkeys as you can? I'm gonna tell you something now. Go on, go in there next week. Oh yeah? Yeah. Taking your mom and dad away. Cuz, like Susan's mom and dad, most. People put me in at home. What, your monkey sanctuary is cheaper? Second. Taking them down. Yeah, taking them down to Carmel. Hold on, I thought you said you'd never go away with parents again. No, no, but that was Suzanne's mum and dad. Oh, this is to get even or something. Yeah, so we'll do that and then. Then we'll can it then. That was your outing. Your phone and both set to parents over. You won't be seeing us ever again on holiday. We've taken you away. We've taken you away. Be careful that the monkey people don't buy you off your parents. Make sure they don't leave any of the monkeys food in the telephone box because dad love that away. Yeah, no, I was talking to him about that the other day about the nickname phone boxes and he. Should we just explain that? Wait, they live in a small village in Wales and it's like one sort of utility store and when it's shut, they leave you shopping in the telephone box across the road. And Carl's dad found out about this, goes now to himself. Yeah. To other people shopping. That's terrible. Yeah, go on. And I was talking to him about that, saying, you know, have you picked up any surprises in the phone box? And. No, no, we were talking about all the stuff he used to do. One of them used to be going in this supermarket, right, in Manchester. Yeah. Needs a new pair of shoes. Yeah. Go in, took a new pair off the shelf, pop them on, leave his old ones there. Really? And walk out again. Yeah, brilliant floor. And then you go in after him, buy his old ones back like an idiot. Yeah, you'd go in the next day. They look nice instantly. We don't advocate the stealing of shoes. From shop or the joyriding and killing. People, unless you've got one day left. John fighting. M. Gervais merchant, Pilkington rock busters. Oh, brilliant. Is there a jingle for rockbusters? I don't think there's ever been one, is there? No. Could you come up with one quickly? Oh, rockbusters. Brilliant. All right, well, the prize is this week there's not many, I have to say. Carl's not source many, but what he's got are actually quality. Well, I've tried to insert him that. It's, you know, quality, not quantity. Absolutely. As opposed to, like, 15 copies of, you know, falls and Osis Christmas pressure with a giveaway. Three wheeler car and primal screams. Greatest hits on eleven CDs. Yeah, not primal scream. Inspiral cars. Oh, that was it, yeah. Anyway, yeah, we've got this new kiss FM hip hop classics compilation. It's got some really good stuff on there. New stuff from the likes of, you know, Outkast and the Wu Tang. But small classics from Public Enemy, of course. Ll cool J's mama said knock you out. It's worth having alone for that track. I think this is four CDs. No, two CDs. The best air guitar album in the world, volumes one and two. And a special box set. All sorts on there. May Ryan Adams is on there, Rodman. But also excellent stuff. Beastie Boys clash. We got the kinks, so that's good. Abigail's party, the DVD thing with Alison Steadman. I know you're quite a fan of that, aren't you, Rick? Yeah, it's good. Good. She's, um. For many years ago, if you've not seen it, it's, uh. It's good. Uh, this, uh, later Jules Holland DVD, it's got, uh, live performances from PJ, Harvey, the Cardigans. Rollins is playing boogie. Boogie over their tracks. I would hope so. Okay. Okay. And also, is this the new albums from the thrills? Uh, yeah. The album, yeah. So that's a little exclusive. It's not even out yet, is it? Wow. That's the sort of things that Carl can come up with if pushed. Let's. It's all about the game, though. It's all about the game. The prizes are just for fun. It's all about the playing the game. Let's see what Carl's come up with this week. This is his last chance. If I ever hear anything like new odor again, that's the end. They did get it out. Just let's have the jingle again. Oh, rock busters. All right, if you haven't heard it before, cryptic clues that make up a band and some initials to help you on your way as well. So, well, you never get it without, but go on. First one. That fella like sucking on iron, right? That fella likes sucking on iron. Yeah. The initial m. Right, okay, that fella like sucking on iron. Right. That's the first 1. Second one.

Ricky gervaism.com dot UK. Brilliant. Red hot chili Peppers universally speaking on XFM 104.9. Well, halfway through, Steve. I'm Ricky Gervais. That was Mister Merchant I was referring to there as Steve. Familiar friends by now, five years in the making. Carl Pilkington. I know him a year and a half, but he's a good friend as well. All right, XFM, where paths cross. All right, so any interesting things to talk about, guys, Doctor Fox style? Any amusing observations? Have you taken a sideways look at the week's news or anything, Karl? Have you? So I did here last night. Come on, go on. Five live. They do like a review of what's gone on in the week. When you've been busy in the weekend, always got time to. To follow what's going on in the world. Sure. Someone's made a chicken with teeth. Just. Because they can choose his food. Yeah, they had a few guests saying, well, you know, where will it all end? I saw. You sure you weren't watching a Wallace and Gromit video? No, seriously, right, it's. They're doing it. They're chicken with teeth. Why would they spend millions? What do you mean? I've got a chicken with teeth. What the. What do you mean there's a chicken with teeth? Sounds mad, don't it? What are you talking about, Carl? That's what they've done. Do you know, like why? I don't know. They're just messing with science and that. And that's what the people were saying. What? Why are you doing that? You know, I mean, where will it start? What's the next thing they did? The sheep. They did the cloning. Right. The rat with an ear on its back did that. Can you. A mouse. Cat coming. Yeah. What else were they talking about? It was all about that sheep again, that cloning one. Yeah. Dolly the sheep. Do you think it's that clever? Well, they do all the same. Anyway, what's it got to do with its cleverness? The fine cloned being cloned. Is it? Is it. Do you think that's a good thing? He doesn't think it's that impressive because they look the same anyway. Right. They could have just put any sheep in there and go, look, they're the same. Yeah. Brilliant. So there was a program people were talking about. What are you talking about? A chicken with teeth. That's. It was the latest news. It was like, all about the war and that. And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then it's a chicken with teeth and saying, hang on your ears. Protocol. Yeah. He didn't. He didn't hear anything about the war, did ya? That was like. They might have been speaking French or just like, whistles. What's. And now story about chicken with teeth. You stop washing up. Someone can let us know. Oh, God. Don't open the floodlights. No, but I'm just saying I don't know the full thing. Of course, she's a surprise. They just touched on it. Yeah. Anyway, other stuff I did do proper research on in a week gone. Having testicles done. Having your testicles done. What does that mean? Same magazine that was doing the hanky coverage. You know what all that's about. How can we get him as a pundit on these new shows like news night, do you know? I mean, sky news just on there. Just ask him what they think. Wouldn't that be amazing? Is there a producer out there that take a chance on pin Pilkington? It's Pilkington, Raggio, Mar, Ian, Hislop and they. A panel of people and they just ask. Ask people. Yeah, yeah. So you can have. You can have your testicles made bigger. Why would you want to do that? Well, that's what I was asking. What's the point? Well, the actual testicles. Or do they just inflate your ball bag? Because you could do that, couldn't you? You could have some air injected. So it was like a big. So they'd look bigger, but they'd rattle around inside, wouldn't they? Make a little noise, wouldn't it? When you're Manakas. Instrument yeah. That was sort of those african instruments. It's like a big sheep's bladder with. Those Pedro in the Manakas. Yeah, yeah. Just strip. Strip to the waist. Yeah. Just hanging out. And then when you're sort of like the neighbors would think, what's he doing? He's. He's been playing those manacles all night. And really, you would. Yeah. You know the mouse with the ear on its back? Go and keep it down. Yeah. This is really loud to me. Hey, why would someone have that done? Then you brought it up, presumably so. That they could draw a funny face on them. Yeah, obviously. And you could let them down after the holiday. Like you do a lilo. Yeah. On holiday, you're floating around just in the sea with your big instrumental manakas. Right. Just floating it. You have the whale of a time, people playing it as they go past. All right, Carl. Bit of a sort of local celebrity. Yeah. There's Carl with his floating manakas. Like a big jellyfish. Right. Yeah. And then the end of the holiday, or Saturday, if you've got a little. Pair of tight speedos, it'll be like Jordan walking around. And then he's like, just let him down when he comes. Let the knackers down for the plane. Hmm. Yeah. Because they apparently they do, uh. They do get bigger, don't they, as you get older, when you're an old fella? No, I think I get lower. I think that's it, that testicles and breasts get lower. Is that purely gravity? I think so, yeah. Probably stretching a bit in it. So is it wear and tear? Is the old fellows who are walking about saying, oh, sick of these. Yeah, they don't tread on them. Well, that's why all people always got a little sit down. Yeah. Come in the socks. Or they can have them. I suppose you can have, like, a little ball lift. You can have a facelift, can't ya? Have a little nip and tuck. But probably a facelift without, wouldn't it? Because that if you pull your face. Up, that's gonna bring the skin up. Bring up a little bit. Yeah. Don't go too far. You'd have a little knob as a tie. But you can, you know, you can. Tighten stuff up for yourself. Steve with his kipper tie. That's a lovely tie you've got there, Steve. And you look so young. What's that little sack underneath it? That little broach. Well, wait. Playing with your little manacles all night, girl. So a chicken with teeth and you can have your balls done. That's. Imagine. Imagine Kirsty Ward, whatever her name is, on news night saying that. And now two features of the week. The war in Iraq. Let's forget that. Who wants their knackers done? And look at this chicken carefully. Bite. I think we should send this link to Doctor Fox and thinks it's an improvement on what I heard during the play. Record player. Record? Yeah. Get this link, send it to Doctor Fox, he'd love it. Plus he'd be offer. Able to offer us some kind of medical explanation. Yeah, exactly. Teenage fan club. Brilliant. One of Kurt Cobain's favorite bands, apparently. Teenage fan club. And that was the song radio. He loved them. We've just had an email here. It says apparently they created the chicken with the teeth in order to prove that DNA can be reverse stimulated. The theory being that if you can revert chickens to a state in which it has teeth, I don't know if it ever had teeth. You can alter someone's DNA to stop them going bold. Carl did that. Just. Did they mean that because birds came from reptiles that had teeth out cops and then changed into a beak or whatever, that they revert? I don't. So they revert DNA. I mean, there's not quite enough science here for me to be able to answer it in detail. Not for us, maybe. I think Carl's probably grasp it. What do you think that means? What? What does he say? Okay, moving on. Ah, dear. Oh, life's too short. You got monkey news coming up soon. Like I say, it's been a struggle. We'll do that. We'll do cheeky freak of the week. Oh, definitely. I can't wait. I'll always do these. I'd start off with these. All right, well, let's have the jingle for cheeky freak of the week. Oh, no, do you remember it? No, I remember it. Oh, all cheeky freak of the week. Brilliant. Something like that. I want somewhere cuz that was slightly half. Oh. Cheeky freak of the week. Excellent. Right, this. We going back again? Yes, everything century. Well, it was. It was 1829. Right. Oh, I'm impressed. Now, the problem is with cheeky freak of the week. Not so much the week, is it? If you're going back to 1829. Well, not even of the century. You haven't even done cheeky freak of the century this. What's the problem with cheeky freak of the week? Just because. Other than the sort of moral implications. Yeah, well, last week it was a fellow with two heads. Yeah, we've done siamese twins. It's time. These twins again. It wasn't a feather with two heads. Last week it was siamese twins. Conjoined twins. Sorry. They're two different people. This is what I'm telling you. But this is the problem. They're gonna crop up quite a lot just because they've got double a chance. Oh, please don't write in and complain. He knows not what he does. You understand, don't you? Kyle will actually feature one day in this section, so. Right. Go on. We're going back to 1829. Yeah. All the way back there to 1829. Retro. Conjoined twin link. A couple of guys set up a business. They were called Chang'an. Oh, they're the first. That's why they were called siamese twins, because they weren't. Wasn't that what it was based on, those two? Chang and angel? Was it the original? Yeah. That's why there's called siamese twins, because they were siamese. So these are the first ones? Well, the first ones, but they're the ones that got to fame, I think. And why people started calling them the people cars calling conjoined twin siamese twins. I think I'm right there. Anyway. Yeah. Well, the. The sort of business sort of going around the US. Well, both of them. And Europe. Yeah. Yeah. And what they used to do. People were amazed by it. Anyway, people wanted to know how they get through life doing certain things that. That you think about. When you think about south east winds, you think about, you know, how do you get through a day like that? Yeah. And the thing that cropped up the most with people was how they take a bath. So they used to go on tour around the US and Europe and sit in a bathroom, have a washing that. Wash each other by mistake. They go, oh, that ends there. That ends there. Like those things in supermarkets. They put one of those down. We go, oh, you know the things on the conveyor belt, the little. The little dividers. Yeah. They wind me up, those dividers. I. Sorry I said a complete tangent, but I. For some reason, it's my own psychosis, but I get so annoyed if I'm in a supermarket, I've got my shop, and I'm just about to get served, and you can always see there are certain people who stand behind you getting edgy, itchy, worried that I'm not going to put the divider down to separate my shopping from theirs. It's like they're terrified that I'm somehow going to deliberately pay for their shopping. Their onion. Yeah. I didn't get an onion. I'll have that. And it's just, but what annoys me is it's not so much that obviously, it's a practical thing. It's the fact that they get a little bit edgy. You can actually see certainly kind of, dare I say it, certain breed of woman and a certain breed of fella will just get a little bit itchy, a little bit edgy, and they just, they just look at, you can just see them sweating, especially if they can't. Really just lean over and do it myself. Well, I know, but it's, the thing is that it's like they almost feel that they, they ought to wait for me to do it, as though somehow it's my obligation. And I just, for some reason it's, I know it's ludicrous, but it really annoys me. And I actually deliberately don't put the divider down just to see them sweat. I like the way that they're actually quite well made. There's some that are brass with like a felt bottom. Yeah. Like you really care. Like a twig would do, wouldn't it? But I just leave a slight gap and then when it gets to the, when the woman's putting it through the tail or the guy, I just say, that's my stuff. You ever look at the people shopping and go, oh, I should have got that often. I'll tell you what it is. It's the same thing. And again, it's my psychosis. When people, if you're on a bus or a train and we're pulling into the stop, but there's a good, you know, kind of 35 seconds before we're actually going to come to a halt, they leap up and they're straight by the door. Yeah, but it's this fear that something. They'Re going to miss out. Oh, my God, what if I fell over now and broke my ankle? I'd never get out. To be fair, I've never had that, that commuters worry. I've never commuted. But every second counts, doesn't it? Because you miss a train, it can make a difference of half an hour. So that's why commuters literally run, to get their connections. But the thing is that with a bus, yeah. You know this often you'll be, people who are sat right next to the exit will get up and stand up for a while, waiting to go. It just, again, I'm not saying it's not, it makes perfect sense for them. My psychosis, they're gonna be mowed down, down in the streets. They will just be a few. You're gonna be in a lovely Chrysler. Exactly. Yeah. I will be going straight through a branch of Waitrose. Yeah. Taking people out in the. We do not condone going through Waitrose in a car. In a car. Now it's changing. They're in the bath. They're washing their own bits. They've got one of those dividers. Right. They go, what? That's. That's definitely yours. I marked mine. That's definitely mine. Don't wash that, Chang. I won't. I wouldn't hang. I wouldn't watch that. Right. So what they doing? They're in the bath. Carry on with the story. That's about it, really. I mean, that's the fact that two. People, two little oriental fellas joined in the hip, had a bath. No, no, that's your story. Didn't have a bath. They saw of everybody. They must have done some sort of research. Right. Who changing. Right. And they said, well, what do people want to see? Isn't that basically roller song? But it's an idea that people have queued up, they've paid them whether they're in a tent there. Well, I hear they're gonna have a bath. They're gonna have a bath. How would they possibly do it? Well, I've heard they get into a bath, but nude. And what the join was more than. How do you get in the bath? I don't know. They just. That's. That's what they picked. They said, what. What would be good to see what, you know. What do you want to see him do? Having a bath. How'd you get into trousers was there especially? This is all part of it. That's why they picked having a bath. This is all part of it. Well, then, once we get dressed afterwards, who was the best out of Chang and Ang? Who was your favorite? They both look the same, to be honest. There's a surprise. One was a short ginger woman. Oh, dear. Is there anything, you know, what would be better than having a bath for you? When you seeing them, what would sort of make you go, oh, I wonder. One of them pulling and the other one going home alone. Yeah. I go like, look, she's definitely up for it. I'm taking her home. What am I gonna do? Can I watch? Definitely not. Definitely not. Look, you go to bed. I want to wine and diner. But if they're. If they. If he's got back to their place and they're going at it. Hammer and tongs. But are you sending one of those? The hammer and tongs were their cousins, right? They lived. They lived miles away. Yeah. Um, if one of them gets knackered, can the other one take over? I think we play a record. That annoys me. What? That sort of being at it all night. What do you mean? Let's put a song and I'll come back. What do you mean? No, no. Come on. Okay. Well, after Rem. Night swimming. Being at it all night. And why it annoys Carl. Night swimming deserves a quiet night. Photograph on the dashboard. See the pots again. Relations. Deserves a quiet night deserves a quiet night night swimming by Rem. Well, before we played that truck, remember, Carl was on the teetering on the cusp of telling us why he's annoyed at going all night. I assume you. You mean relations? Yeah. What do you mean? What annoys you about sexual relations all night? The concept or people keep you up? Is it your next door neighbors or something? No, just. Just that thing of people who say, oh, is that it? All night last night. Who says that to you? You know, lads who think that, you know, think they're a bit of a lad and think that means it's good. Well, like sting and his tantric sex. Sting? Yeah. Well, to be fair, it goes for 8 hours, but only three minutes of that is going for it. The other sort of, you know, seven and a bit is sort of laying next to each other, isn't it? Right. Sometimes in a different room. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is that why it's called sting? Hey? Well, if you're at it all night, it's gonna sting. So what's your problem with this notion of going at it all night? It's just that thing of, you know, get it done right the first time. Get it done. Yeah. Get in, get out. Like the SAS. Once you've done it, you've done. You know what I mean? Yeah. No fanning around, no messing about. So, uh. Yeah, it's just that, you know, it's like, do it right the first time. Once you've washed up, right? You put the pots away, you don't dirty them again. What a lovely analogy. That's one of the great. Is that what you say to Suzanne? Come on, love. Once you've washed, I've already washed up. You don't dirty the pots again. Hello. Is there a fire? Oh, hello. Did he have a mustache, the fireman? XFM radio ahead. They're there on XFM 104.9. And we could. Gervaise, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington with the answers to Rockbusters. The biggest quiz on radio, probably. Mm hmm. Do you want to remind the. No, no. You mean the crappiest quiz already. Yeah. First one was that fella, like, sucking on iron. Yeah. Right. The. The initial was m. What was the band? It was metal liquor. No, wait, I've never heard of a band. Metal liquor. Metallica. You said metal liquor. I don't understand. Metal liquor. Metallica. What? Let's say again. Say again. And try and make Metallica sound like metal liquor. Met Metallica. Metallica. Met Metallica. Is he having a fit? Say it again. Make Metallica sound like metal liquor. Metallica. Metal liquor. Okay, nickel. Second one. The jamaican fella spots a boat. That was easy. That was d. That was divage. You got that? Make it sound like the band debauch. Make it sound like a jamaican fella saying spot in a boat. Debarge. Right. So you got that one, the last one. Draw a game of tug of war. Well, it's up to you. You own it. Right? That was e. That was your rope. Europe. Right. Who did the final countdown? Yeah, so that's the. No. What? We'd let that go. That's the three answers for this week. Who's the winner, Steve? Well, again, I mean, lots and lots of people have got it right, Rick. So I don't know if it's just us that think this is rubbish, but. Well, you know, I'm always a fan of people with just something, a name, I don't know, that maybe tickles me. And sadly, I did want to give it to. I wanted to give it to Daniel Jowett because I just, for some reason, Danny Jowett. But sadly, I just realized he got it wrong. So I'm going to give it to a different dad. Only. Did you ridicule his name? He's not even getting the prices. But better luck next time. Instead, I'm giving it to Dan Mason of Ilford. So he got them right and he wins those prizes. Okay, more of that next week. I mean, what. What do we think? We'll do it next week, then. Yeah. Okay. What are you doing now? A record or so. But I'm not. The hoopla. Hoople. Yeah. Monkey news next. Mock the hoople. Roll away the stone. Classic little ditty on XFM 104.9. All right, play the jingle. Oh, is it brilliant. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey news extra. He said monkey news. I tell you what, been having a bit of a problem this week. Why? It's just been a struggle. Normally, I can come into work on a Monday and there'll be something that's happened over the Saturday, over the Sunday night, you know, I mean, over the weekend, the monkeys have done something. Been very quiet. I thought, I'll be alright. Let's see how the week goes on. I don't know if they've caught on to the fact that we're giving this coverage now or. I don't, I don't understand. Normally people are emailing me stuff all the time about monkeys. Been very quiet week. I've been checking. I was looking in books last night and stuff. Is there any monkey news? I've got some, but just because it's not that good, something else I found out that I thought I'd share with you. I was looking in the Guinness Book of record, right. Because I thought they'll have something in there about monkeys or something. Right. And there's a little monkey, I think it lives in Asia, right? There's loads of them live in Asia. Mine has been traveling, but. Yeah. And something found out. I don't know if they've got it right and that's why I want to bring it up. Apparently it's the mammal, right. That's got sort of the pointiest eyes, eyes that pop out of the red. Steve. Now the thing is, right, I thought, that's interesting. Yeah. Apparently it's the biggest. With the sort of goggle eye type thing. Right? Yeah, go on. Apparently they come out of the red 1.6. What do you mean? They protrude. Yeah, they protrude from the head at 1.6. Okay. How long have you got a ruler? Right, 1.1.6. I'll tell you, I'd be a little bit annoyed if the monkeys beat me. Well, I don't think it has. That's what I'm hoping. Is there anything we can. I mean, what's 1.6? It's about. Drop your trousers. It's, well. Oh, well, three quarters of an inch. What do you think? I don't know. Have they got it right or what? Maybe I should come down to monkey world with you next week. So anyway, so that's, that's not the monkey news. That's just something that cropped up and. Sure. I didn't know. Once, when we were playing Paul in the office, I think Lucy was your partner. Yeah, it was me and ash versus you and Lucy. And you were having trouble because his glasses kept slipping down. So Lucy pushed his glasses up his nose, but the glasses touched his eye. Do you remember that? Uh, yeah. He started it. He started it. Well, you're the one who joined in. No, I know, and I feel, I feel bad now. Yeah, he makes me nervous when he goes, yeah. No, I'm just trying to think about which part of your fat, middle aged physique I can pick on the tits. Would be a good thing. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, there's Belly. Sure. Oh, what do you think of that? Oh, that's. What is that player record? Is that monkey news for this week? Have we not got any other monkey news? Well, it's just. It hasn't been that good. I mean, the one that I found out here, because we've covered so much in the monkey world, right, the fact that we've done a monkey that was a sort of half man, we've done a monkey that got a. Got a decent job in a train station. Can you think of any of the other. Well, that's just some of the great monkey news from the past. That's what I mean. So that's what you got to compete with. So even though this is quite amazing, just tell us another monkey's got married. Oh, not another monkey getting married. What do you mean, it's got another one? You know, it was knocking about with some woman monkey for a bit. A woman monkey. They decided to, you know, get married. Yeah, they did. What do you mean they decided to get married? Was it pressure from her parents? They had a. They had a good do and. Peanut volubonds. Yeah. Celebrated in a pub and then they both went off to the cage at night. That's. That's what I mean. Even though that is quite impressive, because. It'S not true or it's a joke. It's nothing. It's not. On an over website, official sort of news website, two monkeys have married in. Romania after a whirlwind romance. Well, that's whirlwind romance. Yeah. A quick one hanging onto the road. Yeah. She was in the tire. Yeah, he saw it. Yeah. He went, I've a go at that. They go, we got a mario now. Yeah. Her parents gave me. Said, do you just. He was in a zoo knocking one off. She went, I can do that for you. Yeah? Yeah. Go. Say the monkey bridegroom was scared by the number of people attending the wedding and refused to go out his cage. Not bloody hello magazine again. No, it wasn't. No. I think it was like last minute nerves, right? Like, you know, I'm single now. It's like, you know, it's the big step. Yeah. But his bride enjoyed every minute of it. She was loving it. She looked lovely, by the way. She looked lovely. Reports she only appeared to have problems with her violin dress. Do you see? You know, the, this is the guest. I hope they didn't ruin it like Anthony Turner and maybe get sort of. Sponsorship, pg tips or something with strong plum brandy. So they got him drunk as well. So they carried on the celebrations at the pub and the boy was taken to a new husband's cage at night. I, I really. Well, I apologize. Play record. I'll tell you what winds me up. What? Monkeys getting married. Well, I'm not getting any action. And I got bigger eyes. Little by little. Oasis on XFM 104.9. Well, that's the show. Ricky Gervais, Steve merchant and Carl Pilgrim. Carl, it was a good show today. It's all right. When it was some. What do you think? What do you think the loyal listener has gotten from today's show? What do you think? What do you think that, you know, we've added to the world? Well, I think. I think they know what they've got. Right. But if someone's just tuned in, I can tell them they've missed out on some, some good stuff. They've missed out on Chang and Ang. They're the, they're the two who are the one, the ones who invented, you know, the siamese twin thing. Yeah, that's it. They invented it. Yeah. You've got, you've had, like, I would. Spend our last day, you know, running people over. Chicken with teeth. Oh, he says it like, you know, there's no other show that could give you all this. Yeah, go on, gay ankies. We've done that. Yeah. No one will be having a problem there tonight. Yeah. Another monkey marriage. It sounds like the end of the news. Yeah. You know, mean the headlines on Sky News and headlines. And. And another monkey marriage in Romania. If you've thought about having your testicles bigger. Yeah, sort of covered that. Yeah. And the monkey that had big eyes, if it's listening, you know, his position might not be safe in the Guinness book of records. And, and of course, Carl stays hard by looking at firemen. Indeed, we've also learned that. Well, that's not, that's not true. Well, you did. All we know is that you saw a fireman and nothing didn't seem to affect your erection. We avoided saying erection. Fact. If anything, it prolonged it. From what? We've avoided saying erection for 2 hours. And then he just, you know, healthy young man. Yeah, no, sure. I'm sure he was. I'm sure he was. But fireman, keep Karl hard. Amy man to end with. See you next week. Bye. You made me.",
