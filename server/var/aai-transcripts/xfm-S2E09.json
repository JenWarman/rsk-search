I don't know if I'm hungover or still a bit drunk. I don't feel. Sound like you're still a bit drunk. Yeah. So what I'm worried about what do. You do every week? So, but what I'm worried about is that the standard will slip. Yeah. I'm not right on the ball. And the other thing is I haven't had a lot of time to prepare the show today. I don't, and I, and I, I don't really, I don't feel, you know, hundred percent. Yeah. I mean, then the. Carl, right. Look, have you finished that sentence? I don't, make me laugh because it hurts as well. And the other, the other, there's no side effect to me being a little bit hungover and, and, or drunk, whatever, is that I can be annoying, right? Yes, yes. Because I just to amuse myself, I sort of like turn the body off a little bit and just poke and annoy people. And I want to, I want to sort of like, well, you do the. Physical equivalent of freewheeling. I so want to climb on Carl and go to sleep on him. Yes. Do you know what I mean? Both annoy him and it'd be comfortable. Yes. Which is, you know, can be annoying. Just a little thing just to make this show a bit easier. If you'd put your hand up when you want one of us to speak because it's not quite, I'm not quite sure when, when the sentences are finished. The hands are up. Okay, good. So hands are up. Okay. Okay, good. All right. Okay. Are you gonna just keep them up the rest of the show or. No, like Carl, do what you've, what you. Good, all right. Do you want to, I mean, is there an excuse as to why you're a bit hungover? Too much wine. Okay. Last night? Yeah, yeah. Good, good. Okay. Because this is the only, I mean, this is the only work you've got to do all week, isn't it? Unless I'm very much mistaken, you don't have to do anything. You just sit at home eating, you know, eating cheese. And then occasionally you do a bit of sort of shadow boxing and that's exercise. And then you sit and watch tv. Is that roughly what you did this week? Yeah. So this is the only 2 hours you have to do anything for all week. This is you have to prepare for. Who can plan a hangover. Right, Carl, you said you had some stuff. Yeah. What have you got? I love the fact that whereas I was a little bit slow, Carl, they leapt into action to keep this show afloat, keep the pace up. Gone. Right. Well, uh, Carla, you hung over as well. I'm just a bit annoyed because I'm with, you know, he hasn't got much to do all week. You're having a laugh. What, what angers me is I. I kind of hope that maybe I could have quite a long career in radio. And I sort of feel like I'm, I don't know the word. Sinking ship. Yeah, those words spring to mind, but because it feels like, I mean, carl, you're just a chancellor anyway. You weren't even supposed to be on air. And you, we've made you into something of a household name and that's cool. And Ricky's already celebrity. He's got it stitched up. He's got corporates, he's got, you know, voiceover work. But I've got nothing. I'm running on empty. I got, I, you know, nothing. I've got nothing. I'm sort of dependent a bit on this. Yeah. Financially and what, you're sort of bringing it down really. Right, Carl, Carl, no, Carl, Carl, tell them how funny I was without there with a bit in that a minute ago. Will we, will we tease them with what we've got coming up next? Yeah, tease us after the next. I think we've already got them for 2 hours. Yeah, we hooked them. We hooked them, Carl. Don't worry. This is textbook radio. What's this? Badly drawn boy? Yeah, badly drawn boy. You were right. XFL 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Carl, you were saying what's coming up. Right, over the next 2 hours, then? Last week was a bit of a mess. Don't be silly. So I've sorted it out. Uh, we'll be doing the same features, right? We've got. I think that was the reason it was a mess. Well, you've tightened it, you tightened the. Ship, signed it up and also keeping people for longer. Okay, right. Tell me, tell me your plans, what. You come up with. Tell me your ethos behind this then. Always show your workings. Always show your workings, Carl. All right, then. So last week we started good sort of play on words that we had going. The well known film educating Rita. Yeah. That's become, thanks to Carl Pilkington's brain, it's become. I've tweaked it a bit and now it's educating Ricky. Brilliant. Right. And that was a new feature we started last week, if you weren't listening, where I teach Ricky stuff. What did you teach me? Taught you about that little chinese hairy kid. Yeah. You didn't teach me anything. You said there was a kid that was born that was slightly hairy, where. The saying chewing the fat came from. That was good. That was interesting. And a man who had a beard being abducted three days again, that was rubbish. Lest we forget, that taught me more about you than about alien abduction. But what happened last week is. Go on. We sort of talked about it all in one go and you can't. Where is this week? You've done what? You've spread it out over the show? Well, I've spread it across the 2 hours because I always found that if you try to be taught too much in one go, you just can't take it in and it'll be wasted. Your experience in school, they taught you in three minute bursts. Yeah. And not every day. Yeah, every other when I felt like it. Yeah. Right, so that's what we're gonna do. Right, so we've got educating Ricky coming up. Educating Ricky across the 2 hours. Okay. And what I do is I've made little headlines again and you decide which story you want to go over first. Well, give me the first headline. No, no, no, not yet. We'll do that. Well, give me a teaser. Hang on a minute. I'm telling you what else we've also got. We've also got. We started it last week, rock busters. Oh yeah, that was a triumph. Yeah, I think we went wrong there. Why? By letting you do it, doing it on air, not thinking it through. Yeah, bit of that. Okay, so what's the rules on rockbusters? We're gonna do rockbusters, but you email in Ricky Gervaisfm dot co dot uk when you know the answers. Right. And sort of round near the end of the show. Right, we'll give out the answers then. So if they think they know the answers, they've got to hang about. Rick, I should tell you now, I'm not hanging about. Don't think that's. I don't think that the listeners are going to go away on empty hands. I was worried about that. I can tell you where don't worry, because Carl has sorted out some top quality prizes. Good, good. First up, this is stuff that people can win and be excited about. This. First up, it's a DVD of the office. I don't know how he got hold of it. They are like gold dust. Yeah. This is the second git. Now bear in mind, I don't know where he's rummaged up from. This is an XFM compilation album. He's managed to sort that out somehow. I don't know how he sorted that out. There's another compilation album which has got some sort of indie type hits of indies. But this is. We got a film to give away. You ask this film, though, because I. Know you're a big fan of DVD's. Yeah. It's one of the big hot releases that everyone's keeping. Arbitrary is. It's not the only one. This film title. Don't be an arbitrary film. Will it be a big. Rick, I don't want you thinking that the film that Carlos sorted out is that he's sourced for us. It's just an arbitrary thing that you want, that you wouldn't get. You could buy for $3.99 in hmV. Yeah. Big basket. Exactly. I don't know who is phoning up to try and win this. You can be. If this is your favorite film, it's yours. Exactly. Okay. But this is. Yeah, this is the big, big star prize. This is the one you're all playing for. It's children of the corn. Stephen King's children of the corn. It's a wide screen, a widescreen presentation on DVD. Imagine getting that and going. Excellent. We can watch this now. But Rick, I mean, let me just run through some of the cast. Peter Horton, Pete Horton's in it. I'll tell you what, I don't want to give it away. Horton, isn't it? I've never seen this before. Horton again. Also Linda Hamilton. I know. You're all she pays. She plays in a piece of corn. Exactly. And I don't know what. I don't not seen children of corn. I could be wrong, but. When you root around the office, why do you start throwing like a mouse, man, a pair of scissors and a pencil? Because that is just arbitrary. That's an arbitrary selection. That's next week's stuff. But also, I should say, we also have some. This is a little bit more exciting. We've also got some tickets for DJ Shadow, who's performing at the Brixton Academy this evening. So he's very good djing and scratching. Plays all the records that you want. Plays all the records that you want. Don't, don't, don't bring your own. He's got all these. I've seen him arrive. He's got two big bags of them. Yeah. So there's. There's three pairs of dj shadow tickets. We'll give those away later as well. Don't just start phoning arbitrarily now. We'll give those away in our lemonade. Sorry, I need some lemonade. Okay, well. What? We saw out some lemonade. Let's play a tune. Come on, Coco. Ryan Adams from his new album demolition, a track called Nuclear. Yeah. I found a new way of making it more exciting when it. When you're talking about summer Argo. Yeah. Brilliant. Agreeing with you make it all interesting. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a really good album, that. Yeah. Apparently just a collection of sort of demos and songs he had lying around. I wish I had that. Yeah. You know, we're giving away those DVD's. And children of the core. I've got an interesting anecdote about the. The office, Carl, we and Carl went out, right? And with me and Jane, Carl and Johnny and Gigi. Wasn't it Carl talk to you? Wasn't. Is it important? No. Okay. But we're walking on the street. Carl was there, though, and he can back me up on this. Um, we had a curry. We're walking back and, uh, this little funny homeless fellow, didn't he? Yeah. Oh, I got to tell you before I go, didn't he? Yes. He came up to me, right? And he recognized me. Talking's more difficult than you think, right? And he came up to me and he went, he went, oh, he said, I've just nicked one of your DVD's from HMB. And he shook my hand, he was so happy with it. And I went, right, excellent. Even. All I do is I just swing the bag over the top like that when I'm going out. And he had a bag full of DVD's, didn't he? And he was. He was so pleased to tell me that he'd stolen that. Great. So that he said, they're going like hot cakes. They are. I know. We get paid for them though, don't we? So we. Not the stolen ones. Don't we? No. What do you mean? Did you sign them for him, you idiot? What, so, um, he just nicked five? Yeah. He was homeless, was he? Well, I don't know. Maybe. Surely I would. You've seen the show. He just walked past curries one morning. Yeah, yeah. Trainer for it. Interesting. I don't know if he was aimless. I did. I didn't go into his life. He shook his hand, though, and he. Made Carl look smart. Do you know what? I mean, so. But he wasn't. He wasn't northern, was he? No. He was like, do you know what, in the fashion show with Paul Whitehouse, that character, that shady character. Yes. The spit of that, you know, ponytail, t shirt on, a bit too big for him and just the movement and everything, really. Like a, you know, a cockney little cheeky chap type person. A little cockney cheeky chip. And. Yeah. He just said, oh, so it's. You said, yeah, you got your DVD's, got six of them from HMV going like oak cakes, they are. And I know if he went whistling. Yeah, well. Chuffed with himself. Yeah, go on. Cocktail. What was he gonna do with them, then? Probably sell them. How does he sell them? Where does he sell them? Does he go to. People go, do you want an office DVD? They're not nicked. Four quid? Yeah, exactly. Have he stolen? No, no, no. They still got the tags on them. Well, it's like those people who, those cab drivers that you've made. So three in the morning who've just got a car. Yeah. Just went out with a car. Yeah. And I'll pick people up and charge them. I got in one once. I said to him, a guy just pulled up. I said, he said, I was in like, east London. I'll go back to north London. I said, yeah, going to swiss cottage. He went, sure, hop in. We set off. He went, do you know the way? I said, well, not really, no. I thought you'd know the way. You're in a cabbie. And he went, no, don't really know the way there. I said, have you got an a to z? He went, no. I thought, what if you're going to go out just on the, you know, just winging it as a cab driver, two things. Take a map and a torch. He didn't have either. He said, well, I'll probably get to Camden. I said, well, I'll direct you from there. Drove on for about five minutes, making conversation. About five minutes later, he went, do you know the way to Camden? I thought you knew the way to Camden. I don't really know the way. I thought, oh, let me out. Four quid. Exactly. And that's. I can't. I don't know who's got that sort of time on their hands that they just think it's three in the morning, I'm at a loose end. I think I'll go out doing a bit of cabbing. Because your dad was a cab. He wasn't. Yeah, it was, yeah. Can't stand it. But it's good money. He was a professor. He wasn't like a chancellor. What was he. What was he doing when he put that little forest Gump in a. In a weedy bin? That was. That was part of the cab company thing. They had to do, like, a charity event once a year, and he did it one year. Never asked him again. Tells the story again. I'd rather not because we got a few sort of complaints about it. Why? What do you get complaints about it? Because it's because he put a kid in a bin and it's not the thing to do. But we could use it as a sort of sobering lesson for people. Yeah. Tell it like. Tell it like, you know, don't. You shouldn't do it. Nice. Yeah, but that's how I did it last time. But people still didn't like it. All the stuff I tell you, you know, we don't take the Mickey out of people on purpose. It's real life in it. And that goes on in life. Yeah. I was saying that in hospital, though. Do you know how he's in hospital? Yeah. You know, he did some jokes about old people and that, and he said, at the end of the day, if something makes you laugh, it's funny. If it makes you laugh, you can't help laughing, can you? So what you meant to do, laughing is good for you? Yeah. So isn't as good for you, is it? No, but there's probably more people laughing at one person. So if you balance it out, there's only one person who's upset and there's a bunch of people laughing. So give me the example of that. Give me an example, for instance, Carl. Pilkington, as he talks and the people listening. Yeah, yeah. No, give me the example of, like, say, you know. Well, I can't, because again, that's what I'm saying. I can't tell you the story. Yes. There might be someone out there who. This person might even be listening and think, I forgot about that. And you brought all back to me. Yeah. So I prefer to leave it. But I think people know. Why did he put him in the bin in the first place? Because he was getting out of hand. What was he doing, though? You see, I can't explain. You can be silly. I prefer to. To leave it, honestly. What was he doing? Was he annoying him? He was annoying my dad and the other people in the cab. Right. And he thought, how can I deal with this before it gets too out of hand? Yeah. He pulled over and put the lad in a wheelie bin. So we'll leave that. How old was the kid? I'm not sure, but, I mean, it was a trip to sort of Blackpool, so I'm guessing. Do you think it was one of the rides? 17. This is rubbish. 17? Yeah. Oh, he's quite an old lad, then, so. A big lad. Yeah. But let's pick him up. He picked him up and put him in a wheelie bin and then on the way back, he got him back again. He said, right, you won't do that. Again on the way back? Yeah. He left him there for a bit. He left him there. What, they went to Blackpool and left the kid in the wheelie bit? Yeah. Did he? Yeah. What was the kid in the wheelie bin when he drove back? Yeah. He not go? No. Because how do you get out? He's tricky, innit? And he wasn't a normal kid, was he? Let's. Let's leave it. He wasn't a normal kid. Right. Right, then. So is your father imprisoned? I think he should be. Song on. Yeah. Go on, then. Feeder. Come back around XFM. One of 4.9. Ricky Duae. Steve Merchant, Carl Pilgrim. I asked Kyle in the week, right, what animal would he never trust? Even if he got to know it and it was a pet and everything, what animal would he never trust? What was it? Was this a wasp? Yeah. Why wouldn't you trust a wasp? I just think that they're shifty. All other animals, if you get them at an early age, you can sort of make them, like. You can train them. A wasp never. Is there anything you do, think there's anything you could do that would kind of win the favor and win the trust of a wasp? What would you have to do, do you think? What have you had it from a little grub? Yeah. And you fed it? Yeah. It's private marmalade. It doesn't affect it, does it? A day dies, don't it, if it does it. So it's not gonna, like, use it willy nilly. That's easy for you to say. What, they. You think they sting arbitrarily? They just sting for the fun of it. They're like, sort of like delinquent insects. I think so. Because last night, right, I mean, this is part of educating Ricky, in a way, but something I learned last night was that tarantulas only bite you if you annoy it. Right? They don't. They don't. Do you know how people say, oh, if you're in a sleeping bag, living in a jungle, a spider will get in there and up. Bite you. Apparently not. You've got to really annoy it. The thing that it really ate is having its leg sort of twisted. Having his leg twisted. Right. Well, that's more they said in a documentary. Almost certainly not. Steve almost said, no, no, I was reading it. Oh, you're reading it. And it was this, because it scrawled. On the wall seemed like a public toilet. I'll tell you more about that later. So if you don't trust the evil wasp, what animal do you trust? What's your favorite? Well, I also, right, supposing your mind, right, was put. Your mind got put into any animal, right, and you've got to get from where you are now, right, to Glasgow, right, as an animal, right. But the authorities are we looking out for it, okay. And it's shooting you. Right, and what, you went through loads in. Yeah, I was thinking about it for it must have took me about an hour. So your mind. Sorry, your mind has been put into an animal and. Yeah, so it's you in this animal thinking, you've got to get to somewhere. Yeah. Maybe your body is in Glasgow, so. And you've got to get this animal to get to you so it can transfer its mind back into your body. But the government knows that I'm. We've all had that conversation. So the government's going, Carl can't have his own brain back. I only have it with Carl, don't I? These conversations go on. Yeah. So, yeah, so you're, you're on the way. So think about it. You think about it just for a second. So let's recap. Your. Your body's in Scotland, right? He's the only one that takes my question seriously. Your brain is in London, right? And there's like loads of security and stuff looking out in the sky for animals or looking on the field, seeing what's looking a bit suspicious, trying to get to your body. And they're shooting, and they're shooting everything and killing all the animals. What thing would you pick to get your brain to Scotland that wouldn't get caught? And I reckon that I've got the answer. A wasp. No, because think about a lot of people get irritated if it sort of wanted to get a lift in a car going down the motorway. If someone's driving the car, it's a nightmare. Yeah, yeah, sure. Cause a. Right accident. Yeah. So think of something that people wouldn't. You know, and the clock's ticking as well. You're taking this really very seriously. You've only got a car. You've given us a lot of thought I need. You have? Yeah. Um. So, uh. Something with speed. Yeah. Could travel quite speed. Well, something that's also inconspicuous. Yeah. Yeah. Is that the sort of thing you're. Yeah. And is it. Is it a creature that's. That's native to this country? Yeah. Right. Yes. I've got no idea. Carl. What? You tell him. A flee flea. Tell him why. Think about it, right? This flea, it's got my brain dead small, the flea. Thanks for clearing that up. Yeah. And it's. It. So he goes right, to Scotland. So it jumps on someone who's going to Euston station. Right. They don't know it's there. No. The government can't see it. Come on, cats. Steve, think of that statement. Think of people just tuned in. Yeah. Now, people get on the train, goes to Glasgow or Edinburgh, wherever in Scotland it is. It jumps off. It goes, right. Jumps on someone else who's going the way it needs to go, gets there still no one's seeing it. Jumps on me. I get my brain back. Government alike. But. And you feel confident that your brain would fit in that of a fleas? Well, you said there was no problem with the size of it. You said you could. That certainly wouldn't be. Pretty much. You could download everything, you know, into a fleet. That's genius. Yeah. That's what you rather have, right? Um. Roller skate feet. And there's little wheels, right? Chopstick hands. Yeah, instead of hands. Chopsticks of hands. Wheels instead of feet. Yeah. Right. Or acne. How big are the wheels? Can I take you guys back to the old school? Do you mind if we take them. Take it back to the old school? Yeah. What are you gonna do? What, you lay on me? No, I just maybe go back to the old school. As long as it's vinyl. Shit. Slam it on. Della soul old school. Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant. Jam named Saturday. Brilliant. Yeah, good stuff, Carl. So, educating Ricky, you were going to tease us now with some of the big headlines. Right. Right. So, okay, the way this works is. What would you rather be, Carl? I teach you superheroes. Three things. A frog boy. Yeah? You could leap. You could leap onto a house, but you have to go for. You have to go first and leap onto a house. You know this frog boy. Right. And that could be useful, couldn't it? That's very useful, yeah. Right. Amp where you've got your hands and microphones and you can talk into your hand, in your whole body. It's like 100 decibels. You can go, oi, come here. And people hear you from miles away, employed. Right, right. Or sado. Right. And that means that you can go to anyone and go, all right. And that's just. They don't know why. They just get fed up for the whole day. Which of those would you prefer? Don't answer. Now, think about it. The frog thing. Do I look like one or. No, you just. You and your little bench over it and everything. And they go. And people walk along and they go, oh, look at that young child from on that roof. He's gonna follow his frog boy, was it? And you go, and you go down, you go, bell it up. And they go, is him. They don't recognize you when you're squatting. They go, I don't know, you are. And you leap up there, save. And you come back and they go, where's frog boy? And you're standing up and you go, Dunno, he went that way. Yeah, I probably have that one. Okay. Okay, go on. Right, so then that. Just go out. Go. I got a bad. Hey, look, Rick, Carl's really planned this show. He's really worked out. Came in early, he was writing things down. And there's me just coming up with. Rubbish, just talking rubbish. So, Karl, I know you've been thinking this through. What have you got? So, educating Ricky, we did it last week. It's where I teach you some stuff. But rather than just teach you something, a tease you. So you want to know more, so you want to take in information. Right? So if only people have taught you like that, Carl. And also it's the name of a. Film sort of nearly coming up soon. Henry VIII is. Well, how many wives come back tomorrow, Carl, to find out. The little headlines? I've got to sort of tease you with the story. Yeah, this is going to hurt me and I'm not very well. Go on. Right, we've got. So. So this is what. Sorry, I'm. I've just got lost for a minute there. This is educating Ricky. Yeah. And these are the stories that you're. These are the things you're gonna tell him. Yeah, but these are just headline versions. These are headlines. It's not the actual fan. I think people will remember things. All right, so you. Bullet points. Who can forget hairy chinese boy? Indeed. I shall never forget that. Yeah. So first headline. Don't do that to it. You know, it can't live without an edge. I've got no idea. It could be about the French Revolution. It could be about anything. I know what it is. No, you think you do. No, no, it's something I taught you. Is it. Is it the fact that cockroaches can live for nine days without head? That's part of it, but it's something different as well, that's what. Okay, brilliant. So that's something. Next one. Do you want. Work it out? If only it was raining. Brilliant. And the last one. What's tomato with you? What's tomato with. You're obsessed with puns, aren't you? At the moment, Kay. It just works. I think it works. Yeah. We love puns. So there you go. So which of those are you gonna choose? Right. Oh, well, I'm gonna have to choose. Don't do that. You know it can't live without it. Can we play a tune and we'll come back with that? I can find out what that is. Wow. What a history lesson that's gonna be. Daddy Warren holes in bohemian like you on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington. Carl. What's the story, then? Right, so what. What did you say you're going for? You've got your three titles, your three teasers. Well, I think I'm gonna go for. Don't do that to it. You know, it can't live without Ned. I'm looking forward to this. Right, so this is educating Ricky. For those who just tuned in now. Something that Ricky told me about when he was educating me was that a cockroach, if you cut its head off, it lives for a week. Yeah. Right. And then it dies. It can't take on water. Sure. It doesn't have a great time in that week, though, does that? I mean, it doesn't get much done. I don't. It just. It just needs water and because you can't find any size eventually dies, you know. Right, so. So what? No, it's not. That's not anyone drink anyway. So with. Have you heard that one about worms? Okay, all right, I've gone. If you cut a worm in half, a lot of people have said in the past that it'll turn into two worms. Right. But I'm actually true. Okay, who said that? No, so it used to be like, you know. Yeah. Kids at school and stuff you. So that, you know. A lot of people think that. Don't pick him up on stuff, Steve. It's bad. No, sure. So. But what they can do if you get a worm, right, and you find out which end its heads up, right. If you sort of. You've got its head there. On the left hand side. Right. And if you sort of cut it in half. Right. But not enough. So there's more of its neck than the tail, if you know what I mean. Yeah. The bit that you've cut off will sort of die and the rest of the worm will get better. So in a way, you can cut it in half and it'll survive, but only one half will survive. Okay. Yeah. What have you learned? I wish you hadn't chosen that one. It's nothing, is it? Would you tell a worm, Ed, from its eye, you put, put it in a bowl of flour and wait till it farts? Yes. I told my mate that, right. And he went, what if it coughs? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it is. There is a bit of truth in that myth of cutting one in half. Where did you get this information? I don't understand where you get this information. From the Fatima Times. It was like the myth, the myth about worms. That was the big article that week. Did it take you as long to read that article to tell us just then? I like the fact that it starts off debunking a myth. Yeah. That we have nerd of. Anyway, you know the, the big, the big thing about cutting the worm in half, making two words. No. Yeah. What's. The other one? Was not the thing to do either, by the way. Don't. Don't go doing it. No, it's not very nice. It's cool. It can get bad and it's pointless. Yeah. That's no scientific worth. Yeah. In that. Well, there you go. Okay, so the others, now you see what I do? Now I'll tell you, the other titles, you're not having them yet. That's, that's the whole idea of this. People will be driving or about to go out doing the shopping. They'll think about that. Now, what was the other two? Well, the other two, they won't think about that. They forgot. No, they will. They will. No, they've forgotten that already. If only it was raining. And what's tomato with you? I'm looking forward to that one. You got a town tomorrow with you. Look. Look what's happening. You see, you already want more education and this is what listeners will be doing. I tell you, you, I wish you were a teacher. I so wish you were a teacher. And kids would be saying that. I know it's 03:30 but I don't want to go home. I want more. Yeah. And that's, that's what I'm doing with you. I'm teaching you. Why are you teaching me things about not to cut worms in half. And what's tomato with you? Please tell me, what's tomorrow with you, Carl? In a bit, Rick. Well, I'd say he's thought the show through. He's teasing the audience. You're excited they're listening. Yeah, it might be, yeah. So listen, I think we should all. Because we got your competition to squeeze and we got all these great goodies. Let's not forget. Hello, children of the corn. I do feel slightly gay now. This is carpet was a. I don't think we should have our names involved. It's not fair, is it? And I think we should give Kyle the money. I don't want my name to this. It's a Ricky Gervais show. Yeah, right, the quiz. Yeah, well, we get out of the way because they've only got an hour to start. Don't you worry about that, Carl. I've already got this one. I'm thinking on your terms. Now let's play a tune. We'll come back with the big competition information. All right? Money mark. We got a classic for money mark from his album, push the button, play that car and afterwards, are we excited you got the competition? Look at his face. He's so excited now. He's thought this through. Rock busters. Rock. Yeah. Breed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Should we do that? Yeah, brilliant. Go on. You're rejuvenated. I. Yeah. Second hour. Yeah, yeah. Hangover finished with. Yeah, done. Good. Add some water. Excellent. That'll often sort it out. Yeah, well, flea is the best way. He just had an argument with a punter. Someone called up and said, I don't think a flea is very good. How would the flea know? Tell him. Tell him what he said. He said, how would the flea know what train to get on? He went, he'd get to Houston and look at the timetable. We're not going to agree on this. He got annoyed at him because the bloke said he'd be better to be a wasp. A wasp would not survive, would it, on, you know, a virgin train or something. So why wouldn't it? It just wouldn't. Because people really don't like wasps, so somebody would end up clouting it and killing it and that brain would never get to his body, so. Right, yeah, it is quiz time. Three. This is all we look forward to. Oh. With the prizes. No, not really, because they might not bother phoning in this not phone or is it email? All right. Okay. Well, a quick reminder then. We got to the office. I don't want people to think that we're just keep plugging the office DVD. We've got nothing else to give away. No, no one gives anywhere. No hanging around in Carl's little room. Did you get a guy from HMV just to knit? Do you get a guy? Just nicknames from HMV. Ponytail. What's that story? So we got the officer DVD, obviously, we got the remix, XFM's remix album, volume two. That's sort of remixes of various tunes. Quite a good little compilation album here. One of those. Kind of the best coldplay, Travis Oasis, blah blah blah blah albums in the world ever. And. Exactly. Have a look on this. Morrisett nine catatonia. But the big one, the big star prize that you're all playing for is, of course, the DVD widescreen version of Children of the corn, Stephen King's horror film. Lest we forget, it's got Peter Horton as the star. So look forward to that. We're going to give shadow away separately, are we? We're going to do that separately? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll give away the dj shadow tickets that are separate. Right. So we're playing for those DVD's and CDs and what's an email competition? Don't bother. Email? Yeah. The phone lines are lighting up a bit. So put the phone down, get the computer started up and it's Ricky Gervaisfn dot co dot UK if you know the answers to these. Right. And the way it works, we did it last week, but if you didn't hear it, I give you some initials and, like a bit of a cryptic clue so you work out who the band is or the artist. It's always a band or an artist. It's not any tv programs and that. So say, like last week we had. We had s, didn't we? And it was better than the average homeless person. And that was super Trump. Right, so it's not always XFM music, it can be anything. And there's three of them. They've got to get all three of them. You've got to get all three and email in. I don't know how long this intro so far. Yeah, but here we go, then. All right. First initials L R. L R. L R. Okay. Yeah. And the cryptic clue is. You should have thought it through. You should have thought it out before you came in. Yeah. Cryptic clue. You've got it. Yeah. I'll take that book to the toilet with me. I'll take that book to the toilet with me. Yeah, yeah. Lr, Lr. I'll take that book to the toilet with me. And don't shout out if you know the unsuccessful. No, no idea, Carl, no idea. Right, okay, so there's one, right, the second one. Fl. This one's actually been emailed in as a suggestion. Okay? That person who's done that, don't email in because you're disqualified from the comp. I'd love him to be a teacher. So it'd be great, wouldn't it? Just to see in one day. Can't we do that? Can't we get you a placement, somewhere to, for you to teach history to sort of like, you know, 14 year olds? I think science, Rick, science would be good. Yeah. I'll tell you what, you got a lot of. Just quickly for me, Carl, explain, say, what can we get to explain that? Everyone learns the kid science? Photosynthesis. So Fl. Right. Fl are the letters and the cryptic clue. Blow the candles out before you eat the cake. Blow the candles out before you eat. The cake, yeah, blow the candles out before you eat the cake. The letters there. Fl. All right, we got fl. Yeah. And finally the third one. Ns. All on. How many they gotta get? Three. Don't worry, there's no more after this, right. Ns. How can I wash up in something shaped like that? All right, that's one of mine. So, so very quickly recap, just in case we missed any. LR is the first one. Lr. I'll take that book to the toilet with me. Cryptic clue. And we had fl blow the candles out before you eat the cake. And the final one. Ns. How can I wash up in something shaped like that? If you think you know the bands, you just email in Ricky Gervaism dot co dot Uk. You win the DVD's, the CDs, and that's it. He's great. I could just, I could sit here and watch him all day do this. Wow. So Ricky gervais fm dot co dot co dot uk. And we'll give the answers out just before, you know, we finish because then we'll keep them opt. All right, Carl, just briefly. This is module four, a natural history. Yeah, just, just briefly explain evolution since, you know, natural selection, origin of the species. Darwin, just briefly describe. That's the monkey thing. What would you have? Fancy playing, Rick? I know you're always keen to rejuvenate the reputations of certain artists when you think maybe they've been kind of unfairly treated in the history of rock'n roll. Yeah. I'll tell you a band I've always thought this would be treated badly. Yeah. The lemon heads, you on you with me? Yeah. Lemon heads. If I could talk, I'd tell you. Yeah. He wrote some good little tunes before he went potty. What would you rather have? Right, Carl, would you rather have a lemon for a head? A radio for a head? What other band is there with something? Head. Radio head. Oh, you've done that. Yeah. Or a talking head. No, but you don't know what. No, because you've got you and then you've got someone else's head on top and it doesn't shut up. It's my head. It's my talking head coming out of your head. Yeah. So a radio head. Just a Radiohead and you can tune in. Right. You know, you said the Carl, that wasps were one of the most irritating things on the planet. Can I offer another suggestion? Yeah. You with me on that? No. Go then. Educating Ricky. We got. We got. We got two left, haven't we? I'm looking forward to that. We've got two more. We've still got. If only it was raining. And what's tomato with you? I'll tell you what, I wish that listeners could see how happy he was when we started getting emails coming in. Oh, yeah, people are flooding in, actually. Yeah. And he's so happy, he started dancing along, going, well, that proves it's a good competition. He said. Look at that, look at that. Look at that, mate. What? There's loads of people emailing there. Yeah. And I'll tell you. I'll tell you what it is, it's not the competition, it's this children of. The corn wide screen DVD next week, some staples and pencils, a piece of carpet. Well, now we've got them and they stay in. Something we've still got to do. Yeah, is running the show now. He's doing well in he. Cuz I've done nothing. I've done nothing towards this. I'm coming out me hangover a little bit if you're worried. So go on. Remember last week we had a new feature? Yeah. That song's got a good story in it and brilliant. I love your catchy titles. They're excellent. Right. And the idea was it was a story in a song, which meant that if it was played on the radio, you couldn't just like, fade it out because you've got to have the full story. Yeah. Right. Well, last week we started the feature with Stevie Wonder living for the city. Yeah, right. But you played the version where it fades out. Yeah. I didn't know there was more to it, so Steve told me what album it was. On. Yeah, I've gone and got it. We've got the second half to that story. Yeah, this week. Yeah. So you've got half the story. What was it? What had happened is, like, the lads living in Mississippi, there's not much going on there. Mississippi off Rainbow's mum live in what? Mississippi? Yeah. His dad's was. His mom was a cleaner. Yeah. Trying to get by. They didn't have a great life, but they still looked after the kids and stuff. There's more to it than that. Have you got it ready? I should hope so. We'll probably do it about half past. So look forward to that. The second half of Stevie Wonder is living for the city. A week later. I love a show that's carefully planned. This isn't the show. This isn't a show, this isn't a radio show, this is. I don't know what it is. We might as well start banging tambourines and it's ridiculous. This is rubbish. Right, but why? Some people emailed in, put him in a wheelie bin, went to Blackpool, right? Some people emailed in the stories, songs with stories in. And one of them was Babushka. Anyway, was that? And I went, ask Kate, was saying, what is it? I said, oh, it's about a woman who dresses up as another woman to introduce her husband. He meant it wouldn't work. Just dismissed it like that. Why do you think it would work? Because you'd know. I mean, say, like. Say, like, right, Susan, right, who I go out with. Yeah, she can see me from, say if I'm coming down the high street. Yeah, she knows it's me by the way I walk. Right, so just the fact this woman went and put a wig on. I know, but you're saying that she put a disguise on these, like, oh, I fancy her and he takes her out and he doesn't. No, it's his misses. I mean, I'm controlling this. Where is the flea? Where is the flea with your brain going to? Glasgow. Perfect sense. Yeah. Babushka. Rubbish. Carl, can we have the tomato story after the next tune? Yeah, but a cold play. Scientist on XFM 104.9, right. Competition, isn't it? No, it's educating Ricky, part two. Oh, is it? Yep. I wasn't even listening. He's doing all the work. I wasn't even listening. Oh, and he spilled some water down that. Right, what's this one again, then? Right, what's the teaser headline? Teaser headline is, what's tomato with you? Brilliant. Yeah. How excited were you when you came up with that you couldn't wait to come in and tell us, could you? I just think it's a good one because you won't forget it now, will you? I mean, like the worm one. What's so special about the worm? You know, a lot of people think that if you cut a worm in half, it will. Two worms will grow. But no, what happens is if you cut the head end slightly nearer the tail than the head, the tail will die, but the worm with the head will be okay. So it's exploded. A myth. And that taught me something. Right, so the second one, part two of educating Ricky. What's tomato with you? Yeah. What this one's about is ages ago. Okay, settle down, children. This is a level history, right? Yeah, yeah. You know, when a mental place with swords was a king, forget his name, but he was a loony, so. And it was literally ages ago. So good luck in the exam. Yeah, so I, you know. All right, many years ago. Oh, yes, clear that up. They thought tomorrow's were poisonous because what. Are they gonna be proved wrong at the end, this story? Well, I don't want to give away the ending, but is it someone to do with it? Are they poisonous? Tomatoes? No. Oh, you haven't believe it could have. Been eating tomatoes all this time. Oh, Steve, what's the matter with you? Anyway, okay, quickly recap. Cookie. Many years ago. Yeah? When people thought tomatoes were poisonous. Yeah, yeah. They didn't know they were poisonous then because they were still eating them. But what was that? Well, they're not. But they're not poisonous. Ah, hang on a minute, all right, let's not. I'm just gonna listen, I'm not, okay. I'm not gonna tackle. So if you remember, years ago, they didn't have like, pottery plates. They had. They had lead plates, right? What are you talking? What year is this? Plates made out of lead. And what they'd end up doing, they'd say, right you are, tomorrow. And they go, yeah, all right. And they put the tomato on the lead plate and cut it. And because of the acid in the tomato, right, it would sort of, sort of make the lead runny. And the lead would go into the tomato and they say, oh, it's lovely, this. And they'd be eating it. They'd get food poisoning. Lead poisoning, what have you. And they'd be really ill. So they thought tomatoes were poisonous, so they didn't eat them for many years. And when you say they, do, you mean the people of Narnia? But, yeah. This did not. Where was this happening? Uh, sort of in, in Britain. Are you putting on the spot there? Oh, I hope there's no, uh, uppity pupils at this school when they go. What do you mean, sir? Oh, if you're gonna go, I'm fed up with you. Do you understand? No. So, so the, the. No no no. You've got no no. Right. Right. Okay, first of all, Kyle, where'd you get this information from? 14 times as well? Do you know? You can't remember. I don't know where I got that from. I don't know where I got it from. But. But what? I don't. Why don't you think that makes sense? But. But what? Someone once got lead poisoning from a tomato. Not just one loads. And then all of a sudden. Why is this educating me? Of course I'm telling you that. Tomatoes, I can't take anything away from this. I don't know what to take away from this. What am I learned? What am I learned? Don't mix lead with tomatoes. Why is this educational in any shape or form? What are you talk. What are you telling me? A long time ago, in the land of Glunk, right, where the ninnies did slip, right, they thought tomatoes were poisonous. Could they have plates of lead? What are you talking about? We all know tomatoes aren't poisonous. Is that the moral of the story? Don't believe these people. That I'd never heard of before. What are you talking about, Carl? I just. I think it's a bit weird. It's a bit weird? Yeah. He's the same people that were spreading those malicious worm rumors. My hangover's coming back. I gotta get some water. Play a record. That was rubbish. I'm eating. Hey, I'm eating. So am I, Karl. You have to carry on. Um, right, yeah, we're all eating crisps. Food crisps. So last week, yeah, you were playing your feature, that song, I shouldn't switch off because I'm enjoying the story. Yeah. And we played living for the city, only you played the single mix, which doesn't have the entire second act, if you will. So, Carl, you've not heard it before. You're excited. You're excited to hear the second act because as far as you're aware, there was a young guy, he's living with his family. They're fairly impoverished in Mississippi, but, you know, they're happy. They're getting on all right. But you're not even aware that he's moving to the big city. No, it just fades out. Well, that's the city in question. I mean, I've liked this song for must be, you know, three or four years, and I've always listened to the single version. I've no idea that I didn't know the full story. So. Yeah, it's not, I mean, I mean, and I know you, your, your attention to detail. You like to know the full story, like where everything. Well, the whole idea of the features to say, you know, you've got a listen. Where the plate thing? Where was the lead plate thing? Where was the lead plate thing? That was like a few years back. Where was it? Where? Scotland. Yeah. It was a problem all over the world. They have to deal with it. You're making it up now. Is it something you saw in Lord of the Rings? So anyway, yeah. Yeah. So the lion of the witch. Yeah, go on, go on. So far, then what, what do we, what did we learn in this story? We learned so far from Stevie that there's a young lad, he's, as I say, he's got a family. He's fairly happy, except they're very poor and they struggle to get by, but they're happy. They're doing it. Anyway. He's moving to the big city. Carl, this is the bit you didn't realize. Just play the track. Okay, so this is halfway through. This is halfway through the tune. Now this is. You've not heard this before, have you? Let's go. So we accidentally played an episode of Kojak by mistake. We were gonna play a song. Carl, what did you make of that then? Yeah, what's happening there then? Hey, he was living with his family. He was fairly impoverished. Right? So what's your take on it, Karl. After hearing that, what I've worked out by it, the first part that we heard last week, everything's all right, but it's not that great living in Mississippi, right? So he goes, oh, I'm gonna go to New York. There's plenty of work there. They'll sort of accept me as, you know, and everything. So he goes there. And the weird thing is he's hardly like, been in New York for a second. He gets on a bus. All of a sudden some cop is arresting him. He's like, what's going on? And then he's got ten years. I mean, didn't, what? You can't hear because the levels are quite bad. I mean, I work with sound. I can't really hear what's going on. You're criticizing Stevie Wonder, guessing that he. Didn'T pay his bus fare or something, and he got ten years for that. I really don't know what was going on. Right. But you're not happy because obviously it's quite. Do you think Stevie Wonder left out some vital ingredients in the story in your, in your education? Like where it was, or at least he got where it was. You can tell what year is. It's right in the mid seventies there. Funky, that funky New York seventies sound. All right. Yeah. You're pretty disappointed, aren't you? You're pretty worried because what went on. Yeah. You know. Well, you know, you're aware, Carl, that, that, because that shows quite a bad image of New York is quite an intolerant city by all accounts. They arrested a guy, but it is seemingly for being black. That's. That's one song where you should not. In New York, killing a Georgia. Rod Stewart, that lad, he was doing all right in Scotland and said, I'm going to go to the big city he got done in. Seems to me it's that don't go there. If you've, if you've got, like, problems, don't think New York's the answer. Right? Oh, yeah. So what you're saying that if you, if you're a bit fed up with your life, but you got, you know, you live with your mom and she's like, really nice and you got friends and life's not that bad. Yeah. Don't, don't, don't go and have. Don't go and be murdered or what? What you saying? Don't go and be murdered? Leave home, but don't go in New York, right? There's other places. Where would you go? Sheffield? Don't know. But, yeah, but you're a little. You're a little man clad. Weren't you in your garden? We had your train set. Your brother blew up. There was a horse next door, and you thought, ah, I want to go to London. So do you know? I mean, you. So you're, you're. You're like that. Yeah, but you're in many ways like the fella in that song. And like. And like Georgie. No, in many ways, you are a bit like Georgie, aren't you? I had a car, so. No, you a little bit like Georgie. In many ways, I think I'm a bus. I had a car, so I wasn't gonna have the problem he had for a start. Right. But I mean, this, I suppose there's loads of things you can look at that story and take out of it. That's what I like about the feature. Right? So that's what you like about the feature. The feature that we're doing. All right. That song's got a good story. If you had a time machine, where would you go? What year would you go? Would you. Probably the sixties. Okay. Would you go forward at all? What's your favorite year in the future? No. If someone could tell your future to you, you would want to know straight away. You knew hesitation. Yeah. You thought about this, haven't you? No. You thought to yourself, if someone can reveal my future, Carl, you know, you've. Got to do one of these things, right? You know, he's not, you know, like quantum Leap. Like a fellow in Quantum Leap. What's his name? I forget his name, but. Yeah, yeah. And you've got a little fellow with Hal, and he's telling you, right, would you rather go back and you go in someone's body? Would you rather go back? You could go back to be a donkey. Donkey that's carrying Mary to Bethlehem. You could be a Saigon prostitute in 1975. All those GI is queuing up. Think about it. Or you could be Moby Dick. Which of those would you be, Carl? Uh. Think about it. Probably Moby Dick's the best option. Okay. What work will we got? Play attune car after this. We need to educate Ricky for the final time. Final time, educating Ricky. We still got to give away these tickets to DJ Shadow, and we've got to give the answers to your magnificent. It's not enough time in this show. It's packed. Race for the prize from the Flaming lips competition. Answer time, is it called? Yeah, we did. We did this, like, about an hour ago. Rockbusters. Rockbusters. Carl Bilkington. Yeah. I gave you some initials. The initials sort of made up a band. We had lr. We had ns. Yeah. Right. So lr. The clue was, I'll take that book to the toilet with me. The answer. Lou Reed. Lou Reed. Good. That's very good. That's very good. Okay, next one. Flash. Blow the candles out before you eat the cake. Yeah. We just play them flaming lips. There we are. Okay. And the final one was ns. How can I wash up in something shaped like this? Yeah, that was nsYnc. Yeah, nsync. It'd be a bit nsync if you had a sink. You wash up in a sink. Yeah. Shaped like an n. You'd be like, oh, I've got everything out. Has anyone got one? Wow. Right. Well, there are right answers. I have to say, carl, you've done very well. It was an enormous response. I'm just going to click on one of these emails. Randomly. I'm not even going to. Look who we got here. We've got. Cath Turner is the winner. Cath Turner gets those great DVD's and. She'S watching children of the corn tonight. Children of the corn. She was going out. I imagine she's going to count. She's going to phone a few friends. And say, I can't come out. I'm ill. They go, you're not. You're not watching. Children call. I go, no, no. And we've learned as well that there are about five other sequels to children of the corn. So maybe we'll give those away. Consider. What else have we got to do? Have we got anything else to do? Quick, Carl, what would you rather be, a tree frog or a tree crab? Quick, what would you rather be straight away, tree frog or tree crab? Tree frog. Why don't you just pick one quick? A tree frog or a tree crab? Would you rather be a tree frog? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What you rather be a tick or a leech? They both suck blood. There's not a lot in it. Go on. Why? Because I heard they've got. I was reading about them yesterday. They've got 300 teeth. And what they do is if they get on you, right, and you didn't get it off with a match or anything, it would stay there and it eat five times the amount of blood to make it five times bigger than the size of itself. You're a scientist. And then it'll just go, oh, I've had enough. And it falls off. Okay. Naturally. What would you either be, a puppy or kitten? Kitten. Why? Just look better. Okay. Yeah. Some great adverts there on exfoliator. I enjoyed it. .9. Absolutely. We. We have to give away these three. We have to give these away, Rick. Yeah. Three pairs of jam packed. I think we've planned too much for this next week. This. I think we have a little bit flabbier next week. Do less. Do less. Rick, can we chill out next week, please? Yeah, go on. So, yeah, we. Any. Any ideas, guys? Any questions? Sort of DJ shadow related questions? Any shadow or DJ questions? The word DJ. I tell you. I'll tell you something I do know. Gone. Right. But I can't really get a question out of it. Go on, just tell us. There's a shadow somewhere, right? There's a shadow. I think it was in America. Yeah. And it's on a quiet road, I'm guessing somewhere like Boston. That's why you don't. Something like Boston and people at night used to see this shadow moving about and they go, what's that? Right. And he got known that the town, the little local town, got known for the shadow, but it didn't cause any problems. What are you talking about? You lost me. What are you talking? Some places get famous, like Scotland's got the Loch Ness monster and that. But it doesn't cause any. It doesn't cause any problem. Right. So there's this shadow walking about on the road. What? Again? Rubbish. Right, so where did you read this? Where did you. This was on the Internet and. Oh, sorry. Sorry. I thought it was. I didn't know it was on the Internet. Right, so this shadow is moving about. And independently of an object. Yeah. And the local mayor. And that is like. Yeah, it's a bit weird, but it's not armin anyone. Involved. Hey. Hey, Mary, we got a problem down here. Seems like a shadow. Wow. It's not causing anybody. No, it's just causing any problem yet. But that's the thing. It was left for years, and then it did start causing problems. I see. That's it. If you leave these shadows to go unchecked, Rick, they go crazy. Yeah. You let them run amok in the city. Yeah. You've got stab. What did the shadow do? It was pushing people off the bikes. It was what? It was pushing people off the bikes. I'll find out more for that next week. Right. We'll do more on that. We haven't had time for education. Never have children. Just promise me now you'll never have kids. We haven't got time. Okay, listen. All right, DJ Shadow, we got time for these to give these tickets away. Yeah, if they just call up. Well, no, I'll tell you what question, right. Where do you. Where does Carl think this may have taken place? If you've been listening to the show, where do you think this evil shadow has been running amok? Let us know the number, Carl. Oh. 8700. 800 1234. But that's it. We are actually out of time. Have I got time for a phone? It's a bit tight. I was told to finish now. I know, but we've got to get finished early today. So. Why? Just because we have. And we're wasting more time talking about why we have to. Oh, this is pathetic. So they call up, where did I see the ghost? And you've got to pick the tickets up from reception. You can go tonight. See DJ Shadow. Shoddy. This is shoddy. Right, see you then.",
