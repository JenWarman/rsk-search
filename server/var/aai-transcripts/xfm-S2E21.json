  "text": "Travis level come through on XFM 104.9. Rookie Gervais, Steve Merchant, Karl Pilkington, et cetera. Got some great tunes actually lined up. Excellent. I've brought in some Amy, man, some Neil Young. I'm playing my favorite class track. What have you got for us, Steve? I got a dynamite hip hop tune by the roots, which I think you enjoy. Got a little bit of Joni Mitchell, maybe swing that on later. I nearly brought in some genuine shorts there. Good job. I didn't. Yeah, exactly. Go away, Carl, what have you got lined up for us as the producer? Rockbusters been off this week again, has he? Yeah, yeah. No, I didn't have a full week off. I had three days off because I was working all over Christmas. Yeah. And still didn't stop working preparing stuff. You've got a nice load of prizes there that sort of coming especially to sort that out. Yeah. Rockbusters. Did you rifle through the drawers up at Capital Gold instead of Daniel? Yeah. Rockbusters were still doing that. Yeah. You're picking it up. Yeah, he's picking it up. Yeah, still doing that. We've got that. Last week, we sort of changed educating Ricky a bit. Just a little. We. I of don't want to be incriminated in it. Well, we'll change that in a sense that rather than giving you too much information about different things, it's hard to sort of keep it all in. I'm giving you sort of information on one thing. So some of your stuff was a little bit too intense. We don't. My favorite story was there was a blind girl, she ate her head and got better and I couldn't take all that in at once. So you should really ration some of the education last week. War related stories. Yeah, it was a war. Do you think of that then? And it was the french battle. Going over the top was John's got a moustache, which you think was ambiguous because someone might have said that. Anyway, well, look, you've remembered it, so. It'S working, so we'll be doing that. And last week, loads of french people. Have just gone to war who were listening to this. You said you wanted to learn some science this week. Did I? Yeah. So the title this week for that is acid. I would sort you some science out. How long did that take you to come listen? But, you know, people. People love Carl. There's comedians come to me and go, Carl's the funniest man. They absolutely love him. Right. But I think we're only seeing half of it. Right. If we can get him on television. His face then when he told me that title was like a child at Christmas. Yeah, it was, it was. He was so proud of it. He was excited. What I was gonna. It was brilliant. It's a bit like when a child's drawn a picture in art class, you know, you've got on the fridge, but you basically think it's crap. Yeah, yeah. It's very much like that. Okay. Is that good? Yes. So we'll be doing that. Do we need them? Yeah. Have you got another one? We have got another one looking at snails, because I know you're not a. Fan of snails, are you? Well, after a bit of research, I found some good stuff out about, like, they sleep for 13 years, some of them. Yeah. And that. So we'll be looking. We've got ritual. Ritual, yeah, yeah. Which is something that. Yeah, well, last week's was brilliant. It's good to have a flathead in India. It's good to have a flat head in India. That's brilliant. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna. I'm gonna play with my favorite Smith tracks. Can I just make a request? So I'd quite like if, you know, if you've got time to bring back, just for one week only, white van Carl, because there's some quite interesting topics this week. Oh, there's things happening in the world. There's a car thing. There is. There is a light that never goes out. Someone's left one of those little things in here. It's brilliant, isn't it? It's amazing. What are they called, those things? I just think it'd be in the front row at Morrissey concert and go, just. Can I just play along? They are brilliant. I don't know what kind of sign that is. I don't know. It's only used for when Kenneth Williams sees someone undressing. That's the only time that is used. That noise, like it was specially created for the carry on films. Yeah, yeah. We need. I don't know what it is, but we need something. When I walk in and see someone changing. Well, what about those? There is a light that never goes out by the Smiths. I phoned Carl up in the week. Yeah. And I said, what are you doing? He went, well, even though it's one of my days off, I'm just doing some research on the web. When found, I think, yeah, I'm doing science. And then he said, you can get wigs for dogs in Tokyo. That's his scientific fact. And I went, what do you mean, dogs? If they need a wig. I said, if they need a wig, what? Dogs go in bald? And he went, like, this is fine to him. He went, it's a stressful city. Tokyo. The world's all right with Carl. He's always got an explanation. I've only ever seen him confused once when in Edinburgh, he looked out of his window one day and he saw a bloke putting a parking ticket on some rubbish. Yeah. And that genuinely confused him. He couldn't work out, could you? It's a bit weird, innit? And the baby and the woman breastfeeding her eight year old child. Didn't. You didn't like, did you? But what's the name? Animals with wigs. I kind of thought, after I put the phone down to you, kind of thought about it, thought, yeah. It's a bit daft that. You sure it's not the aging pop group? No, the animals. But when you think, have you ever seen, like, a bald pet? No. It's weird. What do you mean? Because my mum, we had a cat. We used to get through loads of cats because we lived in them. Oh, God. It started early today, isn't it? What do you mean? It's only 01:10 we're only a restaurant. We lived up. Oh, God. What do you mean? No, we lived on, like, a main road. Oh, yeah. So we used to get through a lot of them. It was their risk. Stop wasting money. You know, it's not. Stop wasting money. Not wasting cats. Right. So anyway, we had this cat that was ill all the time and it's. Just bag of noodles, probably. Yeah. Malingra. Yeah. I'm terrified I'm going to witch house. Wrong. Oh, God. Bloody hell. Wrong. Don't let me go to the pilkington. For some reason, it kept being sick all the time. So my mom kind of thought, I've had enough of this, and she shaved it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, I know you're not vets in your family, but what correlation did your mum think there was between you being sick and shaving it? Because it kept being sick and it was a pain to wash because it. Kept getting sick, so she wanted a dry wipe cat. Why didn't you just varnish it? What? It's weird, though. So now he's cold and sick? No, but, no, I mean, not all of it. She left sort of the back half, but sort of from its waist, sort of. I love that. Shave it because it's sick on itself. It was the weirdest looking thing. I mean, normally I like cats. I'm always, like, giving yours a stroke on the head and that. Yeah. As soon as she did that, it was like, oh, yeah. So now it's sick, cold and hated. Yeah, I love Carl. It must have. I mean, the other cats must have been taking the mick out of it constantly. It's just making things worse. Did it get. I'm hoping that it got run over and was put out of its misery. No, I think it got all right, that one. Or is that the. Did get run over. Oh, God. Oh. Oh, dear. How many cats do you say you got through? I'd say whilst I was living at home. I mean, it's still on the increase, even though I'm not there. So whilst I was there, probably five. God. Oh. And were you upset each time or you just got used to it? It's one of them things in it, like I've said before, when you first see something, it's a bit of a shock, do you know what I mean? It's like the elephant man or whatever. Yeah. First time you see him. It's that sort of. Oh, look at that. Do you remember the first time you saw Steve? No, not being funny. Do you remember the first. Yeah, but I've said this before, it's always then you get used to how people look and you don't. No, no, I'm gonna burst, you know. But got used to it. Shut up. Shut up. Let you down. Gold rush on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Brilliant. Rick. I was in. I don't know whether I should tell you this because it might rock you to the very core, but I was in an indian restaurant the other night. And you've not seen the film. Have you seen the film notting hill? I haven't, no. Right. In the film Nottingham, have you seen that car? Do you remember the bit? Julia Roberts plays a movie star, rather. Like she's the most famous, and she's. In a restaurant having dinner with Hugh Grant and she overhears some people in the restaurant slagging her off and saying she's a slapper. Probably all actors are, all actresses are. And she's stewing on it and Hugh Grant wants to say something and she says, no, I wouldn't let you. And then as she's walking out, she goes and says something to them and of course their faces drop, they can't believe it's her. And I was in indian restaurant the other night and they were slagging you off, Rick? Well, they were saying is they were going, oh, Ricky James. The thing about Ricky James is he's just like the character he plays. He's just like David Brent in real life. And I was listening in and I was thinking, well, I want to say something. I want to go over another word and say, you know, you're partially right, but I couldn't. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know. I didn't know what to say. I couldn't. What could I do? I couldn't really go over there and get into a rumble. I want to say, what do you mean that I'm like him? I use his face and his vocal cords. But, I mean, I can't help that. But it's that thing as well, of, I don't know where they've got this information from. They've received it from somewhere or they've read it or some of these. It's just. But I don't know. I mean, I can't really be annoyed, but they're just wrong. But it's very weird. It's like being annoyed at a vicar believing in God. I can't get annoyed with him. I just don't believe. But because obviously they didn't recognize me. It's rather like, you know, when they talk about that idea that if you could go to your funeral, what would be saying about you? It's the closest thing you could get to that. You can hear what people are saying. About your friends, but why don't you get around to the gut? You go, he is. Yeah. What do you think of the other fella? Sometimes with him? Yeah, that tall fellow. He's good. Any. Yeah, I know. It's a shame, actually, because on the occasions I do get recognized from minor appearances, I never get any cool fans. I just get the nerds. I get the real nerdlingers. I don't get, you know, beautiful women coming out. Putting them off, though. Putting them off. You got to take what you can. Well, but you'll have nothing. No, I know, but this girl came out the other day and she said, hey, are you that guy who's involved with the office? I went, yes, I am. She went, my boyfriend loves you. He's over here. And she pointed him out. I was devastated. I thought, I'm in here. There is nothing. There is nothing going on. But there was a guy who was in HMV and he was working with the t. He'd been working on the till, and he saw me. He said, would you sign this DVD? I went, oh, no problem. I said. And I was trying to make conversations. I was trying to be frothy. And I said to him, oh, selling well, is it? And he went, it is, it is. Although we've had quite a lot of returns. I said, well, don't tell me that. What did he mean that they didn't. Like, you have been bringing. No, I think it's. He said, they've been bringing it back. I said, what was the problem? He said, they didn't really like it. No, some of them didn't really like it. You can get it back if you don't like it. I mean, I don't know whether they gave him the money back, but certainly that's what he dealt with. That's what he'd encountered. He said, we didn't give the money back. They just wanted to drop it off. What? They didn't want the money back. They just wanted to get rid of. It in the house. Oh, but we still get the money for it. Do we still get the money? But again, because I'm people that recognize me, again, I was in a record shop. There was a stack of office videos, and this guy went by, and I sort of heard them as they went by. You went, oh, office. Yeah. A lot of people. A lot of people like that. I think it's shit he's made. When I agree, of course, again, I was like, what could I do? I couldn't say anything. I couldn't pipe up and go, well, that's sort of. The fact that you're always hearing these loud vocals. Yeah. What's the chance of that? That's brilliant. Maybe everyone's always slagging it off, but it's part of it. That's part of it. But also because I keep standing, hanging out by stacks of office DVD's, wearing a t shirt with a picture of you and me. Yeah, that'd do it. What we got to play, Carl? Something Steve wants. Well, actually, I must dedicate this to someone who's emailed in. I mentioned earlier that I was gonna play some of the roots, and Joe from Peterborough is very excited about that. So this is not from the current roots album, sadly, which I've not fully absorbed yet, and therefore don't feel like I make a decision on which track to play. Maybe that will come future. And thought we put into our, you know, picking music. Exactly. I had these cassettes in my bag from last week. Sure. Anyway, this is from the album things fall apart. It's the roots, featuring Erica Badou. You got me. Let's play it. Featuring Erica Badou. That's the roots. And you got me good. I like that one. Yeah. You've enjoyed that? Yeah, I love it. Yeah. Well, it's coming up to 130. And so it's time for Rockbusters. It's a structured show. It's a new leaf. This show in the new year is going to be structured. Set pieces hitting our marks. Do you know what I mean? There'd be time checks, weather checks, if you're driving careful on that. So do the price check for traffic if it's bad. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Well, again, an arbitrary selection of good. What are those politicians doing? Was that XFM news? Right, what have we got? So we've got, for those that are a fan of the movie Donnie Darko, which a lot of people rave about this year, a sort of weird teenage movie. Then there's a sort of sweatshirt there. It's actually quite nice. It's not bad at all. It's medium. So if you're a bit of a bloater, don't bother to apply unless you've got a friend already. We've also got here a Graham Norton video certificate, 18. So please don't phone up unless. Or, sorry, don't email in unless you're above the age of 18. Yeah. And that's, I think, the best of his tv show. Yeah. Look forward to that. It's a big, stiff video. That's a big, stiff cock of a video. Thanks very much. I meant. Yeah, you meant the bird. Yeah. There's also a fairly mediocre british wartime thriller, enigma, which a lot of people. It was hyped for a while, but it's actually interminable. I've seen it. The first series here of the Kumars at number 42 on DVD. I think that's award winning. So that's available as well. We've got two CDs, by the look of it. We've got Pulp's greatest hits, which I don't think sold very well. And so presumably they are giving that away. And Johnny Cash's current album, American four, the man comes around. There's some good cover versions there. Again, another big sale. A big sale. We're really pushing this. Yeah, it's quite kooky. Johnny Cashier does covers of things, including personal Jesus by depeche mode. We've got bridge over traveled water, his version of that desperado. And anyway, it's not bad. That's probably the best treat in that bunch. Right. I'm assuming there's some questions there. Right, here we go. If you're a new listener. The way it works, I give you a cryptic clue and some initials and it sort of makes up a band. Makes more sense when you hear it, I reckon. Wow. Not really, although people do get it. I just worry about the state of our listeners. Go on. Right, so there's three of them. You email in. Ricky Gervaisfm dot co dot uk. Email only, I repeat, it is email only. Yeah. Okay, here we go then. Number one, there's normally two easy ones and a difficult one. Sure. Number one, don't argue with him. He ain't going to change his mind. Don't argue with him. He ain't going to change his mind. Yeah, that's a yeah. So that's the first one. He's not going to change his mind. What do you mean? Um, I'm just thinking about what the answer is so they don't write the answer down. Don't worry, they get it. Yeah, don't worry, you can't remember it. You came up with it. There's only three now. I know, it's weird, innit? No, it's not weird, it's incompetent. Right, the second one. Anyway, I hope you get this. Email. In and tell us the answer. This is a shambles. Go on. He always gets what he wants and doesn't worry about anyone else. Pee, you don't know. That is. I'm sure he'll come to me once I see it on email. What do you mean, once they get it? You'll agree with them. I'll know if it's the one I had down as the answer. This is brilliant. Come on. Imagine Jeremy Paxman doing that, going, is that right? Go on. So that's, give us that one again. He always gets what he wants and doesn't worry about anyone else. P. But you're confused. I don't know. You can be confused. Yeah. The third one, I'll have to put that woman in the oven and that's a b. All right, quickly give us the right. So the first one, don't argue with him. He ain't gonna change his mind. That's a, he always gets what he wants and doesn't worry about anyone else that's pulling and I'll have to put that woman in the oven. Ab all right. Okay. Ricky Gervais fm dot co dot uk. I'm gonna play a classic track now by Neil Young Alabama. Beautiful. Neil young Alabama. Carl is still confused. He's waiting, he's biting his fingers waiting for an email to tell him the answer. To the clue he made up but can't get. I love that. As an experiment, as a psycho. I mean, that would confuse psychologists, that you come up with something that you can't get. It's brilliant. Yeah. You came up with the question, you. Don'T know the answer and you expect them to, but you can't. And you made it up. Look at your face. That conf. Place some adverts, honestly, Joanne, by Billy Corgan's new band there, smashing pumpkins. Sounds a bit like him, but I like it. It's all right, I like it. You know, Rick, instead, that someone's got the right answer. So Carl's relative knows the answer. Yeah, brilliant. Well done, Carl. You're a fool. Right, well, talking of which, so long time since we've had any white van. Carl. For those that don't remember this particular hot feature, we basically asks Carl some of the questions that are asked of a white van driver in the sun. They always have this on Saturday afternoons. Anyway, here's the first one. They're not fascinating, Carl, but I'm just interested on your take. Really? Yeah. What do you make of Cilla Black? Quitting blind date after her husband sent a message from beyond the grave. She went to see a medium, and supposedly her husband passed on information through the medium, which was incredibly vague, but persuaded her to quit live on air. Well, it's about. It's about time in it. If even dead people are saying, enough's enough. I'll tell you what, though, genius, talking about ghosts and that, do you know how I'm into them? Yeah. Right. How weird do you think this is? Right. Which is not true. Before you say it, play a record. No, go on, go on, go on. Right. It's this woman. I don't even know if it's ghost, really. It's just a bit weird. Yeah, sure. There's this woman and she's. Well, she's not a woman, she's a kid. Sure, okay, sure. She's walking down, like, a street in her area. It's a nice day and everything. Everything's normal. She's walking down and a woman comes up cycling past, right. The woman on the bike looks at the kid, absolutely terrified, right. Got a really scary face on her. Yeah. The kids thinking, why is she doing that? So anyway, she thinks, nothing. Nothing of it goes, you know, I think she's playing in the park, whatever goes, and has a nice day about 15 years later. All right. Yeah, she's. I don't know, I think she was going to work. Right on a bike. She's riding her own bike. Riding her own bike. Cycling down the road. Oh, yeah. Looks at the kid. That's the thing that happened like, 1520 years ago, right? It's her on the bike looking at her as a kid. Right? Not. Not another child. No. So it's her. She's seen herself, Carl. I mean, I don't know where to start. Firstly, where's this information come from? But I mean, what. Why? Do you ever consider. I mean, I don't know what part of that you think can be true? I don't. I'm honest, I'm. I'm speechless. I don't know what to say. What are you talking about? Bit weird, don't it? But it's not. But nothing happened like that. She said it did. Well, she's wrong. She said she saw herself. She saw herself as a kid, didn't she? Did she come and as an adult. When she was a kid, did she. Stop and talk to herself or did she write on by think that's a bit weird. There's me as an eight year old. I won't stop. I'll be late for work. Yeah. Yeah. If I late again, the boss said he'd be in trouble. And where's this information? Was it. Did it happen to someone you know? No. You overheard it on the bus? No. It was in the 14 times. That's the answer. I got to the bottom of that. Right, good. Brilliant. Now, what do you make of David Blunkett accusing gangster rappers of making kids believe guns are cool? It's a hot topic there, Carl. I imagine you've got some strong opinions. He's. He's saying what? He is saying, basically, that all this rap music is advocating gun use and violence against people, and he's very worried about it. Yeah. Okay. All right, next one. Have you thought about going into politics? Because I'll tell you this, they wouldn't be able to argue with you. Really? In the houses of parliament, where would they start? Yeah. My name's Bellow. He's an idiot. No, but violence has always been about. And I like cowboys and Indians. They didn't have playstations and two pack then. And there was still violence. What do you mean? In the Wild west? Yeah. Do you know? I mean, so you can't really blame it on stuff. It always happened. That's, you know, that's the world. And it's made up of different types. Not again. He's right again. He's sort of right in a way, in his. In his innocence, in his buffoonery I. Didn'T hear what he said. He just said, there's always been violence, you know, I mean, it's, you know, dinosaurs. Look at them. They cause a lot. And then he went too far and made himself. I'm just saying, it's always happened. It always will. Yeah. Don't, you know, don't try and change it. Yeah. Just chill out is what you're saying. You know what we should do? We should all get on our bike, go and find ourselves when we're little and go. Be careful what you do in life. Oasis supersonic. Still good, still good. On XFM 104.9 with Gervaise, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. You'll be pleased, Rick. Go on. Ricky Anderson is emailed. Dickers. Dickers Danderson. He's probably our biggest fan. Did lie a little diddler. Exactly. He is emailed in. As ever. Ricky, your show fascinates me. How do you maintain such levels of senseless drivel? That's from. From Randers. From Randy Anders. So thanks again, Dudley. Yep, well done. He said. Yeah, that's great. I get a buzz. I was disappointed last week where he didn't. What? Asking why he's. Didn't respond last week. No. It's a shame. Busy. I don't believe he had something better to do. Well, I wouldn't also. I can't believe that of anyone when you got this sort of level. Exactly. Intense chat. What are you doing this week, Carl? Well, I've had a few days off on. Yeah. Still, you know, doing stuff for this show on that book I was in. Yeah. Just. Just doing. Doing nothing. And bought a place. I was. I was looking at kitchens. Yeah. Weighing some of them up. Yeah. Checking them out. Checking them out. And also ordered a sofa. Yeah. Nice, sort of comfy, sort of leatherish sofa. A leatherish. Oh, I don't know. I don't like leather sofas. Yeah, but what are you picturing? Another sofa. Another sofa. Squeaky. And it's. No, this isn't. This isn't it. No, this isn't like that. But I want a really old sinking to fabric. I want. I want a sofa that is as comfortable as a bed. Do you know what I mean? Well, if it was acceptable, you'd have a bed in your lounge that was allowed without seeming like you were sort of like, elderly or. That would be good. And I'd have. I'd have a drip going in. Yeah. Sort of like with nutrients, you know, I can't be bothered to chew. No. Sort of lager with. Sort of vitamins. And then. And then one going from the knob down to the toilet to the lavatory and with all the remote controls and I. That would be amazing, to be fair. You're almost there, Rick. I've certainly seen the toilet tubing my dad's bed. Right. My dad would never change his chair when we try and get rid of it because it would just fit to him and it'd just be absolutely dilapidated. Right. And. Sounds like he had, like his own chair in the length. Yeah, his own chair. Right. And then. And his bed. Right. Went. They had separate rooms towards the end. And his bed. Right. It was just. He had it for years and it was a big dip. It was just like a spoon in the middle where it just. It was concave. And my mum used to just vacuum it out. Oh, well, the little bits are like, you know, he'd have a fag in bed or he'd do his roll ups in bed. What? Why do you like that bed? It's curved, you know, he goes, it means I can't fall out in a hammer. Great for his back. Well, I don't think it mattered to the end. Yeah. So, yeah. A hammock would be. I really would love. A big bean bag would be good, wouldn't it? With a telly? A bean bag as big as a bear. It'd be amazing. Yeah. But this is still the telly thing because do you prop yourself up a little bit to watch it? Do you watch it on the side? Which is annoying. Do you turn the telly on the side? That's always. I've always wondered about that. The way the weird thing is, right. You know, I've mentioned before about certain things that are just. Right. Like your. And five fingers is just enough. Right. One more. The sex tip. It ruins stuff. Yeah. What one lesson, you, you know, saying about drying your pots and that'd be really slippery and that. Yeah. Right. And the weird thing is, right, I. Think that's what nature had in mind. Like. Like my mom and dad, right, they moved to this little, like, little house, right, and they had loads of furniture that they collected over the years without chucking out. And they've moved to this small house. So they just had too much furniture. Right. And they had this double bed and that was for, like, you know, when friends come around and that they can stay there. But the problem was he wanted to sort of put these wardrobes in the bedroom. Right, right. That went on either side of the. Bed, sort of wrapped around. Yeah. But because the room was so small, he thought, I can sort that out. Yeah, right. And he sawed the bed. He sawed the bed. He saw the whole thing. So you've got like your mattress, your bed and everything. What, he just sliced some off, like a big sandwich. Just cut a bit off, the crust off. How much is that? Would you say about eight inches, but. Hold on. But that won't work because it all fall out the side. What happened to the springs and all the supports and stuff? It didn't all come out and that. I mean, it's not the comfiest bed, but. But the weird thing is it did it. And even though it's only like that eight inches or whatever, it totally ruined it. Yeah, well, of course it would. No, but what do you think? I mean. I don't mean it ruined it as in it looks a mess. No, it would have been uncomfortable. Not even that, though. Just the fact it's that little bit shorter. It's like, God, for two people. This is. This is hard work now. This is like, you haven't got enough room even though it's only eight inches. Why did he. Why did he build the wardrobes first without measuring, putting the. Think he did all that and then thought, oh, it'll easily fit in there. And it didn't. So he had to sort of saw a bit off the bed. It's just weird. I only ate. Did he use an electric. One of his electric saws? Yeah. And I was just. Presumably there was just kind of material and word just flying everywhere. What did he do with the legs? Did he have to move the legs in a bit? He moved the legs looking at it. Right. Once he's got like, the quilt on it and everything, you wouldn't know. I was like, yeah, that's all right. Done a good job. And I went to bed at night, he's like, you know, sleep well. Got up in the morning after having about 45 minutes sleep and said something not right with that. Yeah, you really are your father's son, aren't you? And he said, oh, well. I said, what have you done? It doesn't seem the same. And he said, oh, I had to shorten it, sort of thing, you know, to fit in the gap. I said, well, I can't sleep in it. I said, and there was a big kerfuffle. My mum was saying, look, you have our bed then and we'll sleep in that one. And my dad was like, sod that. Yeah, yeah, it's ruined. Some idiot cut it. So there was a big debate going on about where we should sleep. And I was saying, look, you know, I only. And see you like every couple of, you know, probably one can. I'm not being funny, but next time we go home, can I film it just for, I mean, Channel four or something? Well, you know, I mean, the Osbornes is not at the moment the Penningtons. That would be extraordinary. Oh, can we film it? That's brilliant. Is anyone from Channel five listening to this show or. Bravo. Pilkington's weirdo. Play a record or do you want to play? Do you want to play? Do you fancy playing some of yours? What have we got? Anything that was sent into you, man? Oh, yeah. No, I tell you, I'd like to play this. Yeah. Bronze Age Fox band from Bristol. My neck of the woods. Always working, always working. He's always working. He's on the ball, he's on the ball. He's on the Bobby ball. Coldplay the scientist. Exon one of 4.9. I'm Jama's with Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl, what are you doing? I wish that's how you spoke. Right. What you doing, then? Let's have a quick reprieve, if we could, of the. Of the Rockbusters clues. Yeah, rockbusters. If you just tuned in, you've missed it this week. If you throw it. That's why we're giving the clues again. Yeah. No, but if they haven't. Hey, what say if they've been busy? Just give the clues again. Don't argue with him because he isn't going to change his mind. That's aa second one. He always gets what he. He always gets what he wants and doesn't worry about anyone else. That's p. Yeah. And the third and final one. I might have to put that woman in the oven. A b. Interesting. Are we telling him or so? No, people have still got a chance to win those extraordinary prizes. Ricky dot gervais at XFM dot co dot UK. We still got features to come, though, Steve. It's incredible. We've still got Rick tual. Remember last time, people in India, it's good to have a flat head. We've got. Do we need them? I've got. That's Rick. Ridiculous. That's a great game. What should we do next? What should we do next? Too much. We get. Do we need them out the way? Yeah, just let's explain it. If you knew. I'm sort of on a bit of a mission to find out, you know, we've got a lot of animals and insects in the world and stuff. Do we need them all? It still amuses me. So we found out we've got to keep jellyfish. We've done octopus said we've got to keep them this week. Snails, do we need them? Just doing some research. Right. I'm sort of working my way through different creatures and insects and stuff that's on the planet. Yeah. Right. And finding out if we need them or not. Right, yeah. Do you know much about snails? Well, yeah, snails in general. Much about snails? Land snails? No, bit about sea snails, like whelks, top shells, that sort of thing. Would you say they're important? And what's the sense you mean by importance? Say, if we had to sort of get rid of some animals and insects and that we're running out of room, do you know what I mean? Because I'll tell you what I know about some snails. I don't know if this applies to sea snails as well. I mean, I called you today because a lot of other places are short, so I know they like to eat stamps. Apparently the glue on stamps, they love it. Right. Apparently a lot of letters and stuff aren't getting to where they're meant to be getting because snails are crawling into letter boxes and eating stamps. That obviously doesn't apply to the sea ones, but that that's a problem they're causing. All right. Were you aware of that? No. You're glad you answer the phone today, right? They love beer. Beer, yeah. And also, I don't know if this is right, but I heard that they sleep for 13 years or can do. Right. I wouldn't know if they can sleep for 13 years or not. I mean, sea snails are pretty important. Yeah. They do quite a good job in the sea. They graze on algae and they provide food for other. Other animals. I mean, you can say about any fish, you know, any animal. Why do they. Why do they exist? Would you be upset if, you know, someone said, we're getting rid of them? Oh, yeah. Yeah, you would be. They're an animal, you know, forget being. Like, favoritism and all that I get for them. Right. There'll be other things knocking around. You can sort of spend your time looking after. You'll still have a job. Don't be worrying about that, because I'm not going to get rid of all the fish. Jellyfish need looking after, so you're safe. Yeah, but do we need them? Come on. There's loads of people saying, come on, we've got to move on through the animals. And you're holding them up saying, well, I want to keep them. He's saying, we need to. That just sounds a bit crazy to me. Just. Just imagine. Do you know what I mean? And they would come to you because you work in an aquarium, so they'd be asking for your advice. Right. And you're slowing it down. Well, they asked my advice and I'm giving it to them, so. Yeah, that's what I think anyway. Yeah, but snails, you know, I mean, like I say, they drink beer and that, you know, what did they do? Apart from some food for a welk? They were. They were around. Their descendants around a lot longer. Longer than we have been. Yeah, they've been around a long time. But what have they done? Well, they survived that long, so they must be doing something pretty good. Well, apparently they sleep for 13 years, so really? Even though they've been around for ages. I think that sounds a bit. I don't think I sleep for 13 years. No, I mean, not all of them. Just. Just the. Just the tired ones. So snails. Do we need them? Well, yeah, I just think they've got. This is, you know, it's not for us to say do we need them or not? We can't. Sales. Do you think we should keep them? Yeah, definitely. I'm proud of you. That was getting really quite annoying. I know. Why did he. What did he think he was doing? What? I don't know what you tell these people. I mean, you don't get their permission to play this out, do you? You just don't tell the thing is. Right. Yeah, I sort of told him what it was about, but we won't say who he is or where he works because it doesn't matter. I just needed to speak to someone who knows. I know. The fact that you were trying to get an answer out of him by suggesting that he would be safe because he could look after jellyfish if he gave the okay to destroy snails. Getting livid. You can tell. God. Brilliant. They've been around a long time, but what have they done? Well, that was great, Carl. Play record. Well done. Oh, I'm obsessed with this song. Red Vines. It's brilliant. I love that. Amy Mann, red Vines. XFA 94.9. Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant. Karl Pilkington. Um, you mentioned earlier when we had our regular email from Dicky Anderson. Yeah, Randers, as I call him, dandy son. Yeah, he. You mentioned. Because we didn't get anything from him last week. We didn't get anything from him last week. Anyway, he's obviously listening, rich, because he's emailed in to explain his absence. Dear Ricky, sorry for not tuning in last week, only I was in HMV returning the 14 copies of the office I got for Christmas. That's from Randis. So. He'S explained himself. Excuse himself. Oh, Anders. We should get him on one day. Yeah, right. Okay. Carl, that's Rick ridiculous. Three amazing scientific facts, one of which is spurious. Okay. Okay. One, girls can't throw because the part of their brain that allow men to throw properly in a girl is used up in emotion. Two, gravity isn't instantaneous. It works at the speed of light, the force of gravity. Three, statistically, you're more likely to be trampled by a donkey than dying in a plane crash. Now, even though the last one sounds daft, I think I've read that about the donkey thing. So, girls, what's the first one? Girls can't throw properly because the part of the brain that allow men to throw is used up in emotion. In a woman, gravity isn't instantaneous. It works at the speed of light. So when you drop something, the force kicks in at the speed of light. Do you reckon, Steve? Well, it's not for me to say. This is a trick one where none of them are rick ridiculous. No, one of them is one of those three. One of those three is not true. Right. Well, it's definitely not the donkey. Right. So I reckon the girl one throwing. Stuff is rick ridiculous. Yeah. Correct. Well done. Well, very well done indeed. Yeah, very well and done indeed. That's two he's got so far. Well, I'll teach you some stuff now. So just say I've always been fascinated by the donkey fact, because it is an extraordinary fact that more people are killed, apparently by donkeys. Yeah. Than they are by airplane crashes. Well, I suppose in countries where they used and, you know, use a lot that, you know, they. They go a bit mad and squash. But my concern is that there's. When you go on a plane, there's so many checks. I mean, it takes some 40 minutes to go through all the checks. The air pressure, the cabin pressure, the fuel. Yeah. You know, flights to take off, all the rest of it. Our checks for donkeys. Nothing. Someone closed the gate. I think so. Exactly. That's our noise. Is he annoyed or not? You're not working him too hard? Yeah, yeah, he's got his hand. Is there two. Is there two holes for the ears? Yes. Well, I think that's what's happening. I don't think it's accident. I think they're picking us off. I think they're so annoyed that a nickname for them is ass. Yeah. And they've got to wear the little hat. You know, they get. They've got ride kids, you know, give kids rides on the beach. And I think they're just sort of annoyed. Yeah. They're sort of just picking us off one by one. If we had the same stringent checks on donkeys as we do on international flights, maybe they'd be a little stare. Wise, if slightly incoherent, words. Go on, Carl. Got that. Right. So, acid, I would sort you out with some science. Brilliant. I forgot the puns in mind, didn't I? Forgot the puns. Go on. Right. So, yeah, you asked to sort of be taught some science and that last week, after being taught about war, so did some research and there's a few things. I think we'll just cover one of them now. Go on. We've talked a lot about hairy kids. We have discussed that. I love the fact that Simon Sharma has never started a program like that. The Jacobites. We've talked a lot about hairy kids. Go on. It's a little bit. I mean, it's not your traditional science stuff, but it's still interesting. And it's a little bit. We have disproportionately. Honestly, I think this show's talked about airy kids more than any other radio show. Well, it's one that. Sorry. Notice both of you there. Dropped the h or the h, or however. So airy, hairy, hairy children. Not sort of airy, kind of lightheaded door. Yeah. There was the case of the one who lived in China. Yeah, and. Which was weird for two reasons. On it. Yeah, well, go on. One was like. It was covered in air. That's already weird. And the doctor sort of checked him over and said, well, yeah, he is airy, but he's quite healthy. Apart from he had a little bit of eczema and a boiling point. That's. That's. That was the main bit of the story on it. Yeah, but this one, right. We have sort of talked about it and you weren't having any of it at the time. What, this. This next bit of science I'm telling you about, right? Remember when I told you about a lad, he was living at home with his mom and dad, right? Everything's, you know, normal life, go out of school, that sort of thing. Then I think his mom and dad had an argument and it kicked off a bit and he thought, I'm sick of this happening all the time now. They kept having arguments, so the kid ran off into the woods. Mm hmm. Oh, yeah. Right. Now he left. He went and ran in the woods and he ended up living with some monkeys. Right, right. And he thought, this isn't a bad life, you know, there's no arguments going on. Sure. He was getting on with them. And the weirdest bananas, this, this is where the science bit comes in. Sure. He grew a load of air on his body. That's not true. It's not true. It is true. It's an acquired characteristic. I bet someone will back me up on this. But no, no, you can't. You, you can't grow hair like that. You might get a little bit more down here, though, Mike. The erectile tissue might, you know, I won't fall out as much. That would, you know. But you don't actually grow a big mane if you're cold and you're a human. Well, he did. He did, this lad did. I know it sounds a bit strange in that, but he was living with the monkeys and because it was cold, his body reacted. Listen, listen. He was no hairier than he would have been if he was walking around naked on a cold day with or without living with monkeys. The fact that he was living with monkeys makes no difference. No, I know, but I'm trying to get, you know, picture in your head what it's like. Although Mickey Dillon's was always pretty hairy, right? So he was living with them and he went into town or something one day to get some food and the people there were like, hang on a minute, that isn't a monkey. He went in naked. No, it was there. Covered in hair. Yeah, but naked, but covered in hair. So it was decent. It was, it was, yeah, yeah, yeah. But they. That was a weird thing. They thought it was a monkey in the shop. So presumably had a big long beard as well because he couldn't shave, could he? No, no, he just colored. He looked like a monkey. And they were happy to serve the monkey. Were they? There's a monkey newspaper. How did he walk? How did he walk? How did he walk? Start upright or whistling along. The picture that I saw on the Internet, he was on all fours. But that's when he was running away after that sort of, you know, realized he was a kid. But this was a kid as well. He wasn't even like an adult with the beard. No, as a kid. Brilliant. Brilliant. The beard kicked in a little bit. So the people caught him. You're an idiot. The people caught him. Yeah. Shaved him. Right. Got it all off. Didn't grow back again. Right. It just you're an idiot. Well, like I say, people will have heard this story or read about it. You'll email in, do. Don't let me down. And they'll agree that you're an idiot. No, no, they'll have seen the story. You're an idiot. So that's a little bit of science. You're an idiot. Did you see the stylish kids libertines? Time for heroes and XFM 104.9. Right. Okay, so have you got anything that is science as opposed to nonsense? Well, kid went off with some monkeys, grew air, came back, shaved him. It didn't grow back. I mean, just think. Right. Something else. Um, there's a few things I found. Yeah. There's a fella. Oh, God. Who had hiccups for 69 years. That was a bit annoying. Yeah. Yeah. There's the dog with the wig that we've discussed. Imagine if you just tuned in. Yeah. There's the dog with the wig that we've already discussed. Did we discuss that? Not really. Did I not tell you what he said? I didn't know. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, there's something here that you sort of know. Is this going out live? This is happening. But remember when you talked about sponges? Yeah. If you get a red sponge and. A blue sponge, you liquidize them, pour them back into a tank after a few hours that they know which was which, and they reform as a red sponge and a blue sponge. Yeah. I thought that was weird when you told me. Yeah. Looked it up, did a bit of research, thought that's sort of sciency. You can do the same thing with a mouse's brain. Okay. Explain a bit more. No, you can't. If you get a dead mouse, you put its brain into a blender. You know, blend it up. Leave it standing for a bit. Making that up on you. You get. You're confused. You watch Nigella Lawson make some sort of pudding. What do you mean? What? It won't work with the brain. Well, it does with them. I mean, not human brain. Don't be trying that. Although. No, I'm out. A mouse one. A mouse one. And what happens, it sort of reforms, goes back together again. Nice. You know, because apparently it's made up of the same stuff as. It doesn't, does it? Because if it's dead, if it's a. If it's a dead brain, the cells can't act anywhere. The fact the sponge is that it doesn't kill the cells, it liquidizes them. It doesn't kill the cells. So it couldn't be a dead brain anyway. It would have to be a live brain taken out from a live mouse for the cells to be getting option and working and being sensitive to each other and that. I don't see how that could work like it does in sponges. I mean I'm not. Do you know, I mean you're not a scientist. I've just sort of read it. Sounds interesting. I'll tell Rick and Steve about it. Yeah. Quizzing me as if I've come up with it and someone else has done it and said it works. Sure. So I'm not using ghosts behind it or do you think there's a scientific explanation for it? No, it's just one of them weird things covered for this one. Well that was another barnstorming feature. Is that the two things you got for that? Yeah. Yeah. I mean is there's nothing behind them. Do you know, I mean by this, there's not, there's not like a weight of intellect behind these facts. Why don't you make that your science project for this week? Find a dead mouse somewhere, Carl, and a blender and bring that in next week. We'll do it live on air, see what happens. Oh, do you feel sort of let down a little bit sometimes with our reactions? What are you expecting us to do? What are you expecting us to just like look at you open mouthed, staring at you in all just like. God. Yeah. Where did you find out? We know we found out you looked on Internet and a strange homemade website by a maniac somewhere who puts on stupid things that he heard through chinese whispers. It's. That's where you get your information from. I doubt that anything you've ever come up with is verified. If it is, it's luck. But what do you expect me to do for you? Do you know what I mean? You know, I'd like to know what the source of the information is. I'd like it to be, you know, a research study by the University of Columbia rather than, you know, a guy who calls himself Mister Pickle www. Lunatics. I mean. Some kind of evidence. Do you know what I mean? I was warning you. Now, you know that Steven Spielberg things come in taken. Yeah. About alien abduction. When you watch it, I just remember this, it's not a documentary. Okay, all right. And all right, you remember our ET, we were discussing that earlier. You know that's not fact. Brilliant black star Radiohead from the bends on XFM 104.9. Rick John has emailed in. It looks here like he's maybe trolled the web himself. I mean, I don't know if people just immediately leap onto the web every time Carl says something in his defense. I think our listeners are always on the web. Anyway, he seems like he's reprinted here. A news story which seems to confirm Carl's monkey boy story. Yeah. What was the news story? Doctors baffled by boy. Six covered in ape like hair. Doctors in Kazakhstan are baffled after finding a six year old boy covered in ape like hair. The boy, called Ablay, was found in a remote mountain village close to the chinese border. He's covered in thick hair from head to toe and has an oval shaped skull. Doctors suspect nuclear radiation or a genetic disorder may be responsible. Fine, but it's an interesting bit. But sorry. It's not that you could have genetic defects. I've seen lots of people born with long noses, 5ft, etcetera. I'm saying he wasn't normal and then went to live with monkeys and grew the hair. That's my point. But it says his mother and father are distant relatives. Such marriages are common in the Kazakhstan mountain hamlets. Now, the village elders were consulted as to what to do with him. Right. Now, these are the villagers, these are the wise men of the village. These are people, presumably, that all year long are telling the village how to live, how to survive. Yeah. You're in charge because you've lived longer. Yeah, exactly. You presumably are solving any kind of moral conundrums. Yeah. Any sort of awkward things. Do you know what they suggested that they do with their hairy son? Go on, send him to the circus. The cow's nodding. Put him in the circus. That was what they suggested. And the mother actually wanted him to go to school instead. I don't know. School or circus? I don't know. We don't know what's better for him. I'm not sure. We must consult the elders. What do you think, Carl? It's not a bad life, is it? The strictest. Yeah, well, you ran away from it. Yeah, but remember that thing that saw about that fella who I don't actually talk about, really? Go on, tell us. Now you've hooked me. Come on, you can say it. It's okay. What, are you worried that it might be insulting to someone? Well, it's not. It's not nice, but we're not taking. The Mickey out of it. You're telling us. Go on. It's just. It was in that book again that you got me. You know, the book full of weird people and things that are wrong with them and airy people and. Yeah, with three legs and that. There's a fella basically just a head and a little body on a skateboard. Yeah. Picture of him having a shave and he was shaving with his. With his mouth like that on the radio. Car is now. Impression of a man shaving with his mouth. Well, it's just a head. Bear in mind he's doing an impression. Imagine a head, very tiny body on a skateboard, shaving with its tongue. That's what Carl was doing. And he was depressed because he kept getting hats for Christmas. But if you were in, you would just grow a beard, wouldn't you, rather than. Rather than go through all the wheels of your skateboard. Clash, rock the Casbah and XFM 104.9. Nearly it. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pumpton. So the answers to this week's rockbusters. Yeah. Yeah. Gives the clues again in the answers. Yeah. The first one was, don't argue with him. He ain't gonna change his mind. The initials there were aa. That's adamant. Adamant, yeah. All right. Second one. He always gets what he wants and doesn't worry about anyone else. That was p. That was picks. His picks. His picks. His. It kind of works. Yeah. And the third one. All right, I let you have that one. I'll have to put that woman in an oven. That was ab. That was Anita Baker. Anita Baker. It's good. Anita Baker. Yeah. I'll let you have all three today. So you've done well. So do you pick a winner, Steve? Well done to Mark Ledder from Bo. He wins those fairly mediocre prizes. Oh, brilliant. Oh, well, we've had a few last. We've had a few last few tears. A few scientific breakthroughs. Exactly. Gotta get a picture of Carl somewhere in the national press. Just his little round ed there as an email here. Carl is trying to distract attention from the fact that he is a monk. He raised among humans and horses and has failed to develop hair. It's. I can just imagine him, yeah. Being the second cleverest in a troop of monkeys. You know what I mean? So fleas out there. Oh, look at his little face. I'll tell you what he. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get a picture of you. Just put it in the radio section of heat. Just. This is what Carl looks like. Oh, another email. Someone said when the monkey boy went to the shops, he was naked. Where did he keep his money? Good point. Didn't happen then. Right. So that's that. We didn't even do all. What do you mean we didn't get around to. Rick, chill. Come on. Give us ritual. We have. Quickly. Quickly. No, we have got time. Just do it. Why haven't we got time? It's ten two. Right. Well, we've got a long truck to finish on. Well, just do it. It's. Do it. Are you familiar with the place called God? Easter island? Yes. Yeah. Do you know what they do out there? Eat eggs. I don't know what they do. Right. There's. There's a lot of people living on an island. Yeah. Easter island. And to find out who's going to be running the place, they, um. They don't hold elections, do they? They have these. Well, they have these birds that lay like, expensive eggs on an island. They like expensive eggs. Faberge eggs. Yeah. Yeah. Go on this island. Yeah. Easter island once a year. No, off it like about 2 miles out. Oh, yeah. Whitsun Island. Sea. The sea. Tuesday. No, tell us. Right. Finish it now. Don't you dare. Mitchell goof blue motel room from the other Nigeria. It's the song this week. Thanks for listening next week.",
