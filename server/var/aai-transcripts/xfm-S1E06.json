I've procured some great gifts to give away. I was tired of seeing all these other people getting gifts and that. And it was all going to that O'Doddle and O'Didley, Diddy o Diddley and Anderson and Sturgeon. Or she's. At least she steals them herself. Well, at least she steals himself to sell him to feed the habit. And that's why I don't mind that. Because it's industrious. Exactly. But I have got feeder echo park. I've got the essential Bob Dylan. Now that is a good giveaway. That's a great giveaway. And reloaded three. Did you buy these yourself? No, little Kyle found them. I have to say, kyle, you've done an absolute dynamite job here, mate. This is great prize. And I thought we could play that trivia quiz where we're the challenge. They get someone to catch us out maybe, or someone. A question. Refuse me slightly. Explain again. Well, we could play a little trivia quiz, couldn't we? Right? And then we could sell the fish. Use the words that you need to complete the sentence then. And we could do this. What's the quiz? I don't know. You've not thought this through. Cold playing yellow. You've got to keep talking, Rick, we're on the radio. I got bored. Did you? XFM 104.9. Yeah. With Steve Merchant. What I was saying was, yes, we could have a little trivia quiz, right? This is how it works. Their phone in. Yeah. Right. And their pitch, a question to us two, right? We won't know it. They'll tell Carl and Carl write down the answer. Yeah. Or on his email. Right? And then it might be something like, oh, who was the first woman mp? And they write down the answer and they go, okay, Steve, Ricky, who's the first mp? We'll write it down, you know, and you'll write down something like the queen. Yeah. And I write down Britney Spears. And they go, well, Ricky says Britney Spears. And the answer is they let you. See, yes, yes, yes. And then whoever's. So they phone in or do they, can they email as well? They can email as well, Steve. Right. Okay, so let me just try and clarify this because I didn't really follow that and I know what the competition is, right? People listening phone in or email in with a question, a trivia question. It could be about anything. I don't do game shows, but one. Which we may be able to get right. They phone in with that or they email it in, but only Carl knows the answer. He asks us here in the studio the question. Ricky and I write it down independently. We hand it to Carl, we see who's got the right answer. It's like 15 to one, but two to. And the great thing is that the best question that we'll vote on at the very end of the show can win these three CDs. We've got feeder, Echo park, the essential Bob Dylan. That's a two CD set, Rick. Maybe keep the questions highbrow to show our intellect, not things like pop and trivia. Good idea. We've also got this big compilation, reloaded three, that's also a two CD compilation. We'll start phoning and emailing now. Absolutely. Questions berserk for gervaise. I'm best at science. Well, don't start saying that's not fair, because I'll say I'm best at films if they want. Yeah, but I've already said don't do trivia in entertainment and that. Well, they should do. They should do trivia. Entertainment, music and films is what they should do. No, they shouldn't. Or old tv. That's the cliche of XFM listeners and I know they're more intelligent than that. They're not. They're not, Rick. They're stupid people. They're stupid, stupid people and they only know about a few things. Garbage. Cherry lips on XFM 104.9. Well, either they really want those CDs or they want to embarrass us because the phone lines are going mad. They are going mad. We didn't even give out the phone number or the email. Rick. Shall I just give it out now? Well, obviously don't need to. Well, I ought to anyway. For those that didn't hear it but didn't know it already of it. 0870-0870-0800-1234. Sorry, that's not. 087-00-8700 because I started again. Because I got. I sort of fluffed slightly. Yeah, go on. Zero. 8700-800-1234 and when he says he fluffed. Like that, that's not how he got into television. Exactly. Ricky. Gervaisexfm dot co dot uk dot. If you want to email the question. And only Carl can see the screen, so there's no cheating, probably. People don't know what fluffing is, do they? No, I don't think so, Rick. Carl, have you had a question? What already? Are we doing it now? I think we should just drip them in throughout the course of the show. Yeah, you're dripping them in. Ask this question. I thought this was a good one. It's from Clive going in. Clive. We've got a listener called Clive. That's all right. Who was the first? James Bond. Oh, is this film? I didn't know. No, but wait a minute. Wait a minute. I know this ambiguity because we've talked about. We talked about this ambiguity before. You see, he could. He might be deliberately embarrassing us, because the old myth is that someone played it on radio that we all know and love. Now, he should have specified. Did he mean the film James Bond? The first film thing. Can I just say. We won't count this one, because the definitive one. I've talked to Glynn about it as well. It's doctor. No. Was the first one of the team that we. Sean Connery. So Sean Connery is the first screen James Bond. So we agree on that, even if we're both wrong. What did he say? Is. I bet he said it was Bob Holness who played him on radio in, like, the 1950s. He didn't say the radio bit, but. He said bubba Holness from blockbusters. Yeah. And I was drawing a little blockbuster thing. That's really spooky. That is. That's weird, isn't it? But the thing about that is, I'm worried if it might be a myth. It may be a myth. Well, no, I don't think it is. It's that. That we can't. One point to me, then. No. Yes. No. Did you know it? Did you know it's when we talked about it? No. Rubbish. Yeah, but who. What if we talked about it? Did I say it to you? No, we agreed that it was Sean Connery because it just. Like. We didn't count Casino Royale. Cause you said it wasn't by the same team. Yeah, but that wouldn't have been the first James Bond anyway. Cause that came later in the series. No, rick. No, no, no. Don't play the music. That's clearly your point. You didn't know it was Bob Holness. He meant it was Bob Holness. I knew the answer, wasn't it? Well, fun loving criminals, Scooby snacks. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Cause we both agreed once in the pub that the right answer is Sean Connelly. No, wait a minute. The point's not that the man phoned in with a question, and the answer the man was after was Bob Hollis. Okay? That's the answer. I'll tell you what, the answer I was after was me. But that's not the question, master. The man who phoned in. That's ludicrous. To face the facts, you can't say, what number am I thinking of? It's gotta be the real answer. No, but I knew the answer he was after. So brilliant. Yes, because even if he's got it wrong, it's such common parlance now that Bob Holness was the first James Bond that I knew the answer. Face the facts. Right, give us another question, Karl. Jeez, give us another question. God, he's a bad loser, isn't it? I had a good one here, but you've forgotten it, or I sort of scribbled it down. This is brilliant, innit? Hang on a minute. We can edit this out, can't we? It's not live. It's only a piler. This is gonna look great when it. When it comes out. Go on. Which food? Yeah. Kyle, you know, making up the question. No, no, it's just that I sort. Of took down the important bits. Brit, this is amazing. This is amazing. Radio. Go on. Which food kind of doesn't make you fat? Jesus. What kind of a question is that? This is. No, it is proper. I love, I love. Imagine this on the weakest link. What kind of food doesn't sort of make you. I mean, does make you fat? What is this doing? Okay, do you want basically no sort of calories in it? Um. Celery? Water? Well, I mean. What do you mean? Do you mean a vegetable? You're right. You're right, apparently. Yeah. It uses up more calories to bite it than. Yeah, but wait a minute. Wait a minute minute, Rick. One. One all. No, it's not one all, because you're supposed to write it down. You didn't know. But you didn't. What do you mean I didn't know? You're supposed to write it down. That's the whole point we're writing. You said water. You said water. That's because I thought we weren't taking the question seriously because he didn't know what he's talking about. What? All we've got. Set the rules. Bit too much like Portishead for my liking, was it? Yeah, I quite enjoyed it. Beat a band. Well, that's because Porter said, are from your neck of the woods, isn't it? I embarrassed myself. Right, another question, quick. Is this. Is this one. Is this question a real question with a definitive answer, or is it like, what is my most comfortable chair? I don't know why people aren't going to. Maybe like trivia pursuit or something, just getting a questioning off that and then. Because they're a little bit more discerning than that. Steve, have you heard the questions? They don't know what they're talking about. This is stuff they've overheard in pubs. Go on, ask it. Ask it, Carl. I look at the car, text down and goes, what's that? I know. What am I meant to write? Go on, then, ask this one. Right. What sort? No. Yeah. What? Semi. Sorry, misses Robinson, we're gonna have to let you go. Yeah, go on. You are the weakest link, Carl. Goodbye. Yeah, go on. The pope. Yeah, the pope. Yeah, we've got the pope. Yeah. That's not strictly a question. He wears a. He wears a dustman's eye. He wears gore blimey trousers. Yeah, yeah. He lives in a council flat. Semi precious stone. What's the stone? The pope wears a semi precious stone. What is the stone? You mean what is it called? Yeah, what is it called? What is it got like a kind. Of paper name, I think it's like, you know, is it. Is it a 18 carat one? So we gotta try and get the carrot. Yeah, of the pope's big diamond. He calls it Dennis the Stone. Do they want that? They want the type of gem it is like. Or is that some kind of people movie? Or do they want it like the Rosetta Stone or the. Oh, you. Oh, I can't play a record. Play two records. Let's not. Where's your head at? Basement. Jacks. Right, okay, let's get this. Have we not this on the head, then? Is this not happening? Oh, here he is. Look, here he is. Come in. Oh, I don't believe. That's pathetic. I do not believe that. That's absolutely pathetic. Now, they won't believe this, will they? Right, if I say that Jonathan Ross just got his massive member out and he is a big lad. Come here. Come and sit down. I've got your tickets, misses Gervaise. Thank you. What's going on here, then? I mean, why are you dropping off tickets? Well, because, you know, in the spirit, the comedy wars, we like to have the rising young stars of the british comedy. That's right. And that's me. Well, we couldn't find any this year, so we would sit in the rising young star seat and I wanted to do the tickets personally, so there's no excuses if he doesn't turn up later. Yeah, I always suspected that you were sort of pretty well endowed. Yeah, and now. And now we've seen, you know, it's on webcam. That was just one of my cocks. That's the one you're wearing today. Don't say that. No, we were going to be the happening young station. What's going on? No, you can't say stuff like that. Yeah, just carefully say, look out after Judy and Clary comes back in a personal life. Jesus, you're thinking of everything. I walked in here and I came in here and I thought, this is the young happening place and what do I see in here? Three old men sitting. What are you talking about? I'm only 28, 27. You all look wrecked. You all look wrecked. Because we're always partying. I was looking for some youngsters. Where's the youngsters? I wanted to see some tight leather pants. I wanted to see some foxy chicks hanging on you everywhere. What is it? It's a bunch of old blokes on a bloke. They're washing up in a sink. Look at him. He even dresses for radio. This is ludicrous. It's amazing. I love the fact you were on the phone to Gervaise last night, weren't you? Asking his advice on clothes? Look at him. He's going for the man down the DSS. I like that look. It's a nice look. Have you got a single pair of trousers that aren't elasticated at the waist? They're maternity jeans. They've got a whole frank panel that pulls this for. The thing is what I do at the end of the week. I can pop these in a pan and I can make a nice soup with all the food that's encrusted in. Me at these years as a homeless. Coming to the floor. Look at you. Step away from Lawrence Llewellyn Bowen. I'd like to be. I'd like to be that bit closer. But why are you dropping off tickets? Are you? A little bit. Because I thought you married and stuff. Why do you suddenly got this obsession with Gervais? Because I'm a bit rough and I. Yeah, it's like when you see Dale winter now with those rough boys. I'd like to get one of my own. When a top celebrity in a lovely looking suit drops, walks down the corridor with his penis out. Yeah, I know that. I'm still. No, you revived. I was. I was inaugurated the same way. For me, it was des O'Connor. It's like. It's the passing on of the baton, if I may use that. You for me. And you've been battened, but it's fantastic. It is a pleasure. I don't think I'm complacent just because I'm mixing you. I still wake up and think, I don't believe it. I mix with Jono. Can I just point. Jono, I was listening to the show last week and I heard you, as always, revealing a little too much about yourself, if you don't mind me saying so, Steve. Trying. Not as much as you. No, but that was just for the. For the benefit of the week. And talking about when you used to occasionally urinate in the sink. Yeah. When you were around my house last. Time and I came and you looked a bit shifty. No, please reassure me. It was more ownership. I went to my territory, then other people that come in and go as Gervais been around here, it's like just marking my terraces. My coffee the next morning had a hazelnut tang to it that I don't remember putting in. Can I just say something? Because, I mean, I used to. I used to, you know, mention to you, Gervais, when we first started getting involved in the business, I used to say, if there was one celebrity I'd like to be friends with, it's Jonathan Ross. Yeah. Lo and behold, Ricky's befriended Jonathan Ross. I'm nowhere to be seen, not invited round. Ricky told me that I could be his friend, providing I never extended the arm of friendship. Yeah, if you ever. I thought as much. He tries to keep everyone else down. He works with from the office, all the other shows, he tries to keep him down. I didn't even. I wanted to meet you on the steps. Yeah. I didn't want to tell him you were around. But you called, he went, who's that? And he saw your name come up and he went, can I meet him? Well, you're coming tonight, aren't you? This isn't radio two, by the way. These links are way too long. This is Snappy radio. We have to play out. The kids have lost interest. Put some more. The kids want to hear Coldplay, cut a toad. You know what I like? How about some of that instantly forgettable hip hop you play each week? One of those obscure hip hop hooray. That's the worst feature on british radio. You should be ashamed of yourself. Wait a minute. Put it away. Put it away. I'm Carl. Carl, how you doing? All right. Got a question for you. A question? Yeah. The pope. Yeah. What semi precious stone does the pope wear? That is easy. Go on, Topaz. Is that the right answer? I don't know, I might have wrote it down. I'm really sorry, Jonathan. It's not. It's not what he publicly admits to, but I have to know because I was hanging out with him, Groucho, one night and he was saying, oh, look at this, look at this, look at that. Top edge. Can't buy that. Look at that, look at that. Vatican City. Look at that. We can make a nice ring out of that. He said. Didn't go anywhere, but thanks for asking. I better go. I've got to go buy some winkle pickers. Thank you very much. Okay, enjoy. Carl, I wish I could say it's been a pleasure, but actually it was quite creepy. See you later. You too. Beautiful day. Yep. Now I was just saying that's probably one of my singles of the year, but was it this year or the year before? Oh, crumbs. I don't know. It was, I think. Was it 2000 that Albert was the first one off the album? Maybe that could be a question. No, we need the answer then. We don't know the answer. No, we are just ask. Jonathan Ross just came in there to drop off some tickets for the comedy ward show that he's hosting later this evening. Yeah, interesting. Of course, a man who's 40 and still thinks it's funny to get his penis out because it's like, when's that? When's that what you're gonna wear off? 74, 75? When? It's just too horrible to show in public, I imagine, but. So he dropped off some tickets for you? Yeah. Was asking you fashion advice last night. Yeah, I mean, he came after a three hour radio show he's just done on radio two. Good show, by the way, worth tuning in. He came straight right here, dropped some tickets off for you. He's now got to go and rehearse that show. He's a lovely man. I was out with you last night, went into this pub like we've been to a few times before. Went in there and this guy came in and said, your usual table, Ricky, your usual table. Can I just ask you two questions? Godfather one is, have we won a prize tonight on the. I don't know. We genuinely don't know. Can you have someone iced for me? It's ludicrous. What have you suddenly got over all these people that they're doing all this? When have you suddenly become the daddy? Well, I came from nowhere and you know, I've got polaroids of the head of all the stations. Yeah, exactly. Because what I'm worried about is that, like, when we're wrapped up in our winter coat. You're walking there and you're a little sort of, you know, little black overcoat and I must look like your hood, do you know what I mean? Like your goon that walks with you twice as tall. Very much like Edward G Robbins. Exactly. Yeah. You are. With a pug face, obviously. Yeah, well, don't go on about it. Sorry. All right. No, I didn't know. You just thought that even Jonathan Ross couldn't save this show. No, he's the only a celebrity I know. I'm all out of ideas. I thought we'd have a trivia game. That's rubbish because he can't read or write. Yeah. And that's. What is it? Are we knocking the trivia game off? Yeah. Yeah. Let's have one final question. What's the answer? I don't know. I don't know. The pope one? I don't know. We couldn't even figure out the question. Carl, what's the stone? What's the stone? Just entertain yourselves at home while Carl looks for the question. And thirst. Amethyst. Amethyst. Yeah. Ann Thirst. No, she was the first woman MP. I think you'll find am, thirst, Ruby or Diamondo. So have you got maybe a final. Question, then we knock this on the head. Yeah, go on in. Where? What? Who? Have you not been practicing in all these? We've had ads, we've had music. Oh, where? What? Rick, I don't think we should call ITV letter. Maybe he was talking about Jonathan's inquiry about sartorial elegance tonight. Where? What? Yeah, maybe he's just, like, summed up that conversation. And just the most expensive pub in London, I think you won't know because he never pays. Hang on, wait a minute. What does that mean? What does that mean? You want me to buy. I'll buy the pub. How much? That's a million pounds if you go. In, according to the Timeout guy, 2001, if you went in there and bought a big round, it's a their pub. Millionaire. I know your specialized subject of how much things are in that and that and whether they make you fat when. You eat them, then it's in London. Is this like, some guy went in the pub last night and thought, this is a bit pricey. I'm going to expose them. That Ricky and Steve showed. Does it mean, like, maybe. Is it a pub or a club maybe where you've got to be a member? That's a pub. I'll narrow it down. It's in Covent Garden. Punch and Judy, that's it. Has he got it right? Yeah. Well, I have to hand it to you. Well done. Yeah, so brilliant. So who was that? Who was that question from? Because maybe that they should get these three cv's. Let's give him that. Who is it? Cole. There's no way of verifying that. That's probably libelous. They've probably made. Okay, what are you moaning for? You got it, right. Yeah. I won. I won't. Yeah. Carl, who was it? That one. Well, listen, they know, so they've won. Yeah, right. This is genius radio. This is brilliant. Him, I know, KP, the P man, when he was just. He was just doing a press buttons and it was cool. Now we let him on the air because we thought it was funny. We quite like him. He's digging a grave for us. Right, listen, this is a new feature I've introduced called songs I'd like to play on the radio. Oh, this is fun. And a friend of mine sent me a little CD of little treats and stuff. One of them is this track. It's called Monkey man. It's from the Rolling Stones. Play it, Carl. It's an absolute gem. I'm a pretty big peanut mountain I bet I feel a true. I'm a cold italian pizza I can use a lemon squeezer what you do have you there when I am just a monkey man I'm glad you are a monkey I was gouged and I was gone. I put on you if I'm like a broken egg I always have an unmatched. I hope we're not too messiatic or a trifle too satanic when I just sa. I'm a mockingbait. I'm a mocker. I'm a mock. I'm a monkey. I'm about that. I know about that. XFN 104.9. What was that again, Steve? Rolling Stones and a track called Monkey man. That's from a double CD not available in the shops. My friend Dave G made a compilation for me. Bird it onto CD using modern technology. That's one of the tracks on there. What's his name? What's his name? Dave Greenwood. Obviously breaking several copyright laws there. I would not encourage anyone to make copies of anything for anyone. It's breaking. Dave Greenwood lives in Nottingham. I can do that for you. He's making you receive, you know, stolen goods. Yeah. There's various artists on there who've barely got a penny, who losing money hand over fist. The Rolling Stones, for instance. Yeah. Have done that as well. Played off, you know, and that's terrible. Now we've implicated those as well. Ex ephemera culpable. So is Dave G. Thankfully not us, Rick. No, we're just middlemen caught up in it. Mister Biggs behind this. There's always Mister Biggs pawns in his game. So that's. I'll be playing another track from that later on. I've got a lovely couple of little tracks on my hip hop selection. Looking forward to it. Did you get a little gift here from XFL? I did. I got a lovely little voucher here. It was very nice. You're very thoughtful. I've also got one. How much is yours for 25 pounds. To spend at John Lewis or Waitrose? A little kind of gift voucher there, I think. I think I do, Waitrose, because food, you can get a good lot of food for 25 quid. You can't get a lot of like haberdashery. So I'm getting food options. The thing about the gift of actual, a lot of people will, I'm sure, receiving these over the Christmas period. The thing about the gift factor is it's like, it's like, here's 25 pounds, but I've limited where you can spend it. It's like they don't give money because that's go say this is like money, but not as versatile. Exactly. You can't spend it in as many places. But it's. The thing is that surely the thing about a gift is, you know, you don't want people to know how much. It was unless you're letting them make their buck, their ideas up for next year. You know what I mean? If an aunt gives you like, you know, a single, like a step single, and you've given her 25 quid, the body shop, you're saying, you know how much that single costs. So do I. I'm not gonna say. Right. Let's make up the difference next year, Sally. Aren't they? You know what I mean? Let's spend 50 quid on me next year. Do you know how much he got? How much did he get? Did you get a gift voucher as well? I work here all week. Right. How much do you get? 100? 5150 quid. What, on gift vouchers to spend at the same places? I'd have to say though, I mean, it's not a very inventive gift, is it? Whoever came up with it, though, it's a lovely thought. It's wonderful to have 25 pounds that I can only spend in two places I never go in. But no, no, I'm not looking at gift horse in the mouth. I'm not looking a gift horse in the mouth. It is a treat. He spoke to Jonathan Ross like he was a normal person from someone whose. Dad buys him a spade for Christmas. I thought you'd be grateful. My only thought is that John Lewis and Waitrose, I mean, it's not very rock and roll. It's not very XFM, is it? I mean, a tattoo parlor. Yeah, maybe, you know, in a bike shop, piercing. I might get my face pierced. Just a big bolt through my head. But they're a little bit, aren't they? A little bit like the man. Are they a little bit mainstream? Yeah. What would be that? We were rocking this. I'll play a record. And don't make it a square record. Some on an indie label or something. Or something that hasn't been even recorded. Yeah, that can't even become available ever. I don't know what instruments they're playing. Oh, Monica. Tomorrow, some 41 in too deep. All right, Steve. It's been a long time, eh? Hasn't it? What has? Luck. That seemed a long time. Well, that music. Yes, no, you're absolutely right. Yeah. It's annoying, actually, that Carl never went to the email, because the questions have been sent in there, good questions, and they've all been sort of neatly spat out with the correct answer. For instance, I might have asked you this if I was the quiz master, Rick. How many noses do slugs have? Oh, I think it's four. It is four. Yeah. Point to you there. Let me just see if I can find another one who, according to the current issue of viz, is a cycloptic pop temptress? Oh, don't know. Is it a pun on having one eye and being. Sounding like cycloptic is the clue. Yeah. One pop. Temptress. Oh, it's, um. Gabrielle. Of course, yes. Two points. Mine are better. He didn't get them. These are rubbish. Have you ever watched? I can understand the question. They're rubbish, I suppose, aren't they? It gives me a chance to know. What? What? The answer is required. Go on, let me see if I can find another way. No, that's. You never get that one. That's too hard. Oh, no, that just. That just teases you more, isn't it? What's the name of. That's boring, that one. Sorry, it's beginning to fall apart again now. Here we are. What's the proper name for Big Ben? Is it St Stephen's Tower? You know, it absolutely is. That's three out of three. That's fantastic. Yeah. Cause the bout named after something like Benjamin so and so, works in it. That's the big bout. It's actually, in a weird way, I didn't know any of those. So it's actually quite good that we did kind of balls it up with Carl. Because otherwise I'd have. There'd have been egg on my face. Yeah. But I still won. I just won less. Oh, did you? Yeah, you did win. Yeah, I've already forgotten. Already wiped that out of my memory. Yeah. And. But, hey, Steve, it's not me that's the real winner. It's Neil who asked that question about pubs, about pubs. And he's got those three CDs. Just tell him what they are again. Just feeder echo Park. A compilation called reloaded. Three. Lots of great stuff on there. And the essential Bob dylan two CD. Have you called him and told him? No, not yet. This is such a shambles in it. Because what if he goes out or something? Actually, if he's listening, can he give us a call? That is so lazy. Can't we call him, like, tarrant? Would you not got his number? I forgot. Carr, this is unbelievable. Get the numbers, carl. I wanted to go for the pope one. Carl, do you actually work here in the week? Or like, did you just, you know, like in a film where they knock someone on the head, put on the space, you, and go to the room? Yeah. Is it like secret of my success and michael j. Fox, you actually work in the post trailer, but Saturdays there's no one around. That recognizes you, so you pretend that you're a producer. Yeah. Cause you don't seem to know any of the rules. Cause I reckon that name's made up. When did I say a producer? When did I say a word? Carl Pinkerton is a name that you'd come up with on the spot. No, he doesn't work. No, he's not a producer. He says he works in sound. He works what? He says. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you what. Work with this. This is my song for the lovers. It's a beautiful track. I've played it before. I'll play it again. It's one of my favorite tracks of all time. It's Bob Dylan. If you see her, say hello is a little bit trivial. For this is the last song I ever played on the old XFM before they came in and said, okay, you can go now. That's incredible, isn't it? Bringing tears to my eyes. Lovely. If you see her say hello she might be happy in Tangier. She left. Here last Thursday is living there right. Here. Say for me that I'm alright those things get kind of slow she might think that I've forgotten her don't tell her it isn't so we had it falling out like lovers off and we and to think of how she left that night it still brings me. A cheer and the last separation. It. Pierced me to their heart she still lives inside of me we've never apart if you get close to her kiss her once for me always have respected her for doing what you did and getting free oh, whatever makes her happy I won't stand in the way or the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay I see a lot of people as I make their rounds and I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town. And. I've never gotten used to it I've just learned to turn it off either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting sound sundown, yellow moon I replay the best I know everything by heart they all went by so far fast if she's passing back this way I'm not that hard to find tell her she can look me up if she's got the time. Well, the greatest singer song of all time. Beautiful. With one of his best songs there, Bob Dylan. If you see her, say hello. She might be in Tangiers. I mean, he's having a go. I mean, if you're gonna go to Tangiers on the off chance to try and find her, I wouldn't bother. Yeah, but I mean, you know, certainly. If you're gonna be there. He's desperate. He's desperate. She might be in Tangier. Have you checked upstairs? She's definitely not upstairs. Just. Just have a look. Well, anyway, that was song for the lovers, but because I'm so excited about having such great prizes to give away for the first time, some albums that Carl found, we've got the lucky winner on the line. Hi, Neil, you there? Yeah. Here, Ricky. Hi. You're a winner with XFM. Fantastic. Yeah, yeah. Do you like Feeder? They're a good group, aren't they? Feeder, Doug. Well, yeah, the kids seem to like him. They do. The kids like them. And then Bob Dylan, he's a. He's a great, lovely bloke with a guitar, isn't he? You're working hard, aren't you? I'm fed up with this, mate. Really. Honestly, I just don't know what else to do. I come in every week. I try, try and. Yeah, you have to write a new series of the office. I'm trying, but I've got voice over work now, so there's more money in that. You're everywhere. Yeah, yeah. So, Neil, Steve Merchant here. Will you be looking forward to receiving these albums? You've got feeder Echo Park, Bob Dylan album, the best of, and a compilation. You looking forward to them? Wow. Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, it's going to really lift my Christmas. I'm not going to get to your home this year, so that's going to make up for it, I'm sure. Neil, of those three, which one will you be putting on first? I think feeder Echo park, because the kids seem to like it. Okay, excellent. Thanks very much. What are you doing for the rest of the weekend? You gonna be chilling out? I'm chilling, madam. Freezing. Playing golf right now. That's madness. What's your handicap? It was my handicap. My short game's terrible, but. Right, yeah. Yeah. You're gonna be watching the national Comedy Awards this evening. I hear that the office is nominated. Ah, you guys are the shoe in. Sorry? You're shooing. It's yours. Thank you. I don't know what a shoe in is, but I'd like to go to one. I think it means, like foot in the door. Lovely. Yeah. No, not foot in the door. It's like, it's yours. Your name's already on it. Oh, really? I would think so, yeah. Well, why would Ross stop around? I don't think he makes the decision. Neil, thanks very much for calling. Those prizes are gonna be winging their way to you. We're just like real DJ's, aren't we, Neil? Just say we're just like real DJ's and we leave you alone. You guys are just like real DJ's. Enjoy your game. Cheers. Bye. Step on my old size nine stereophonics. Absolutely. Well, talking to Neil, it all brought it home, you know, maybe I should give a little bit back. Yeah, you've had a good year. I'm hanging out with Jonathan Ross. I'm doing ads. Yeah, but I care. I'm still in touch, you know, I'm still down with it. And it's coming up the time of year where we should, you know, care about people less fortunate itself. And what I've done. I've recorded a Christmas single. That's beautiful. And all proceeds are going, you know, to, you know, little sick people and that. And are there gonna be any proceeds? There's gonna be not a sausage. Right. So I'm safe. But I tell you, this I was thinking, actually listening this morning, and you go in, doing some Christmas shopping. You go in the shops and there's always, you know, walking in a winter wonderland and all those songs. No one writes those sort of things anymore. No. Well, you're wrong, Steve. Really? Listen to this. What's it called? Don't cry, it's Christmas. Let's hear it. Don't cry, my baby Santa's coming soon. Though you ain't got a mommy or daddy Santa still loves you and he's riding on his reindeer to trample down the gloom. So don't cry, my baby Santa gonna make it soon don't cry, my baby Santa's feeling kind though you know, you never see him. He's not just in your mind, and it's not that he's invisible. It's because you're going blind. So don't cry, it's Christmas, Santa's still on time. Don't cry, my baby Santa's on here. You know, he's got 6 billion children and he's only got one day. You've got slightly less than that. If I were you, I'd pray. So don't cry, it's Christmas. You're nearly ten. It's a little gay. You know. As far as I'm concerned, it's already become a standard. One of the classics. Thanks. There's a star, Ash. Good. It's great show so far, isn't it? Enjoying it, Rick. But I'll tell you this. What worries me is something we've not done. Which is what we've not. We've not taken on board. Some stuff I've heard from the management. They've said they've enjoyed the kind of light hearted flippery, you know, past on the show and, you know, the likes of Jonathan Ross getting there. Just knobbing it out. Yeah, but they just feel that sometimes it's a little bit cheap and they just want to be a little bit more highbrow at times. A little. Well, you're a smart guy. We've proved that. With clubs having four noses and Stevens Tower. Can I ask you, Rick, about politics? What do you want to know? What you want to know. Because I'm politics. I'm a political person. I thought this much. Go on. What? On the politics. What do you make of who to vote for? Vote for the government. Whoever's in the government. Yeah. The liberals. Ever? No, not if they're not in government, no. Okay. What about the foot and mouth, which a lot of people have worried about. Don't worry about it. No, no, recession is hit. A lot of people losing their jobs. Should they. What should they do about it? Get another one. Get another job. Yeah. And I'll tell you what this is. And this is, I mean, you can have this for free. If you do lose your job or something, get another one. But get a one that's even better than the one you lost. Right. Okay, good advice. Yeah, maybe get. Maybe if you were just like kind of the post boy before, like Carl. Get in charge of the company. Get a manager's job. Right. Become director general or something. More money. Good, good, good. And don't lose that one. Okay. And what else is concerning? People, we get calls all the time, Rick, to the station, people saying, I'm worried about the war in Afghanistan. Yeah, yeah. What do you make of the war? Is it. Is it one of your favorites? Well, no, no, no, no. My favorite. All wars bad, but my favorite. I'm putting you on the spot here. What is your favorite? Is he really? Yeah, yeah. Is it the Falklands war? It was a range war. What does that mean to Carl? Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. Drawing pictures at school and that. Yeah. It means that our missiles could go sort of 17 archers only had missiles that go like, you know, 9 km. So we just parked our boats about 1213 kilometers off and we were shelling them, I mean shelling it out there and theirs were falling in the water. Yeah. So it's the war equivalent of holding a midget at arm's length, right. And he's trying to punch you and. He can't reach you. Or just kicking him in the balls at will. Rick, a lot of people talk about Ww one as being the great war. Was it a great war for. No, it was a good war. It wasn't a great war. Right. What's the problem? Well, I liked all the. I like the bayonets and the trenches and all that stuff, but I could have done without the poetry, right. Only because the poetry is a little bit bent and you know what I'm saying is the only time that it isn't bent in a war. But you know, there's beautiful, but there's one I remember because we are the dead. Once we lived, felt dawn on our face, but now we lie in Flanders Fields. Be honest, if you'd have had a gun in your hand instead of a pen. Yeah. You might be laughing. You would be dead in. And the war would have been over by Christmas. Absolutely. High five. Yeah. So that's politics, Carl. Any other questions? Carl? You want solve any high economics. I've done economics. Cause, yes, economical. Anything else? I just think you should look after yourself. Carl. I've just got something to say to you. Hip hop. Hooray. Let's play my hip hop track. Put your hands in the air. Move them around like you just don't care. You're not even bothered. I'm playing an old school track this week, Rick. I'm going back in time. How you spelling school, Steve? Oh, with a k. Go on. Ever heard of anything by digital underground? The Humpty dance. Might. You might remember the Humpty dance. Do you remember that? That was a fellow who sat on the wall and he was getting dissed by the police and he fell and he broke all up. And the king's horses shouldn't have really been sent to repair an egg. They couldn't do it because of their hooves. Anyway, digital underground, for those that don't remember, was an Oakland group led by shock Garner and chop master J. Go on. But of course, most famous now for the fact that they featured two pack Shakur. Love him. Where he first began. You'll hear him on this track. It's called. Which one have I chosen here? I think it's called the same song. Have a listen. I came for the party to get naughty get my rocks on, heat popcorn watch you move your body to the pop song that I'm singing ding. A ringing funky beats ringing everybody swinging. Into place as I kick the jz y style r and b mixing it with the hip hop swing be champagne in my hand it won't be long till I'm gone it's just the same. Old song it's just the freestyle meanwhile, we'll keep the big chicken sweat dripping girlies in the limo we in chicken, ooh, still get the grease on your pantyhose I love your robo move over, I gotta blow my nose sneezing but still I'm pleasing all of slimmies pull out my jimmy time to get busy with a jenny if it's good and plenty, don't you know there I go, there I go, there I go but I don't go nowhere without my gym hat what I'm rapping is if she's clapping and I'm strapping. Cause I'm smarter than that and then, girly, maybe we can get along cutie after cutie it's just the same old. Song. Just the same old song, y'all it's just the same old song it's. The same song. Money d the freaky dicky the squeaky up and down well, as a matter of fact, I'll be right back. I gotta take a leak. So while I'm draining entertainers but I got fame and the bases I touch too much for me to try to be naming a yo he saw me on cable and grim I busted in and I was going with the wind I clock gable back and open it's the same motion same freckles and hat. Drinking the same for hypothetical, political, lyrical. Miracle whip just like butter my rhymes illegit cuz I'm the humpty not Humpty Dumpty, but humpty hump here a hump, there a hump everywhere shut up and. Just listen not dissing, don't get me wrong but to me it's just the same old song so just watch cause my name is shock I like to rock and you can't stop this tupac, go ahead and rock. Now I clown around when I hang around with the underground girl she used to flound say I'm down when I come around, gasp and when they pass me they used to dis me, harass me but now they ask me if they can kiss me get some fame people change want to live their life high same song, can't go wrong if I play the nice guy claiming fame. Must have changed now that we became. Strong I remain still the same song. Song it's just the same old song. Yeah Humpty Hump in the house, y'all you know what? It's the same old song. Ross was slagging off the hip hop feature, wasn't he, when he came in earlier? And how can you not like that? Digital, underground, same song. I think he was scared of it, Steve. I think it was intimidating. I understand it by your youth. Well, he's scared of the youth. He's scared. The fact that I'm down with it. The homies and my bitches and my hoes, yeah. Cause he's not with that. You know, he looks dapper. If they saw him in the street walking down like a ponce, they'd just laugh and jeer. Probably rhythmically. Yeah, yeah. And he couldn't come back at anything. And you'd be high five in. I think he was intimidated by your style. I think he's jealous of you, to be honest. You know, I think what he's probably most jealous of is the looks. Do you know what I mean? I got the new haircut because we might be on the telly later. He didn't mention that, did he? Did he? Well, he's never seen the old one? You've kept it from me. He's got nothing to compare it with. But that was a great hip hop selection there. Yeah, lovely. Even though I say so yourself, Rick. We'Ve had a couple of people, because they've. They've listened to your dissection of current politics and epic economicals. Yeah. And they've got a couple of questions for you. Go on. We've had one from Jimmy Ruffin. He says, what becomes of the broken hearted? Oh, dear, that is a difficult one. I don't think I've got time to go into that, because is a very delicate problem. Can you answer this one from the KLF? What time is love? Any ideas? Listen, keep those questions coming in for. Maybe I'll sort them out later. We got something. It's not the end of the world. Super furry animals. Absolutely beautiful. XFM 104.9. Rick, you're gonna do your film review for us. We've got time for it, I think. I'm not. No. Why not? I'm not gonna do anymore. You do anymore you love. It's great. And I just think it's time, you know, I did. I did a dozen, but I did all the. Do the films that I would give like nine or, you know, ten out of ten for. I don't want to drop the standards. Right. I started doing films that are eight out of ten. Yeah. You see. Yeah. That's where a lot of film reviews go wrong. Yeah. Ross being one of them. Yeah. I've seen you go, oh, this is worth seven. Don't do it then. If it's no good, don't do it. Know yourself? No, sure. So. So no more film reviews. No. Until a great film comes out. Sure. Like Braveheart two or something. Which will be nine now. An eventful. Yeah, I'd have thought. Yeah. Yeah. So nine for that. Rick, it's almost the end of the show and still got time for the song for the ladies. But Carl won't be here next week only. Where's going? Where you heading, Carl? Going away for Christmas. Tell us what? It's a secret, what you want, in. Case your fans try and track you down. What, you're going taking pictures of planes in Greece? What? Political, Rob, your house? Satirical, Steve, satirical. Where are you going? What you do if I tell you? What, if I was caught in a foreign country and. And the government said, no, it's okay, they were train spying or planes. But I go, no, I am a spy. No, I am a spy. No, you. It's all right. You were trained spying. I wasn't. Wasn't spying. Please. I saw you at the doctor who convention as well. No, no problem. Probably an assassin or something. I'm probably an assassin. Karl, where you going, mate? Tell us. Come on. We're supposed to say when. What's that? Here. What? People rob your house, yeah? We didn't say. Tell us your address. Tell us where you leave the key and then tell us. You're going on holiday. We said, where are you going on holiday? Barbados. Oh, yeah. Showing off. Boosting. I'll tell you what, Steve, what I'd like to see. And a lot of the listeners right there too, pop around there. Now touch him for Christmas. Shall I touch him for Christmas? Touch him any way you like for Christmas. Can I just introduce a song for the ladies before. Well, love him for Christmas, though. Can I just say yes, as long. As you love and touch him. We're going to leave you with the excellent Tim Buckley, of course, father of Jeff. I'm just gonna be watching. But love, also on that CD that my friend Dave sent me earlier. So if you don't like it, blame him. Yeah, while he's been arrested by the copyright police. And it's called buzzing fly. Let me touch you. I can put you in touch with your family and my family. I'm liking it. So I can't. Look, I'm busy. Look, I'm busy. I would want your green smile when all the love was there. You're the one I talk about. You're the one I think about. Everywhere I go. But sometimes I am in the morning, Lord, I miss you so. That's how I know I found the. That's how I know I found your name. Tell me if you know just how that river flows down to the sea. How I wander. I wanna know everything. What makes you smile, makes you wild, makes you look in this way. Darling I wanna know. Darling I wanna know. You're the one I talk about. You're the one I think about. Everywhere I go. But sometimes I let in the morning, lord I miss you so. That's how I know I found the home. That's how I know I found the home. A walking hand in hand. All along the same a sheep I knew. Your name in your love is growing loud. I think a nose is flowing through you and me. I'll tell you when I see you. I tell the Darzin flower coming to your life. I float away. Icon in the sun. Was it right or wrong? I couldn't sing that song anywhere. Over dark now I remember how the sun shone down and out warmed your dream smile when all love was there. You're the one I talk about what I think about everywhere I go. Sometimes I never in the morning, Lord. I miss you so. I miss you so. I miss your soul, Mama. I miss you so much. I wish you so. I wish you, son.",
