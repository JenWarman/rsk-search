  "text": "Oh, yeah. The smooth indie sound of Richard Ashcroft. Science of silence on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. Joined me is Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. It was an excellent link that, Rick, did you say name at 1.104.9? Other than that, again, yeah. A desperate attempt to be in articulate, sure. But let myself down with your thing about the boxing thing because there's no chance of me, you know, slurring the words. No, no, I already slurred my words. Yes, any damage will be totally fine. Yeah, the doctors rushing in. I think there might be some kind of concussion. Jane just going, no, that's just the way he talks. I'm thinking maybe. Did you start the show with that particular kind of manner? Just because obviously a lot of new listeners, I imagine thanks to the massive poster campaign and you obviously want, there's. A few examples today of irony coming back and biting you. That seemed like a funny idea at the time. Me posing that Jonathan Ross phoned me up when they first went up and said, I've just seen a big poster of a predatory gay. Yeah, you do look a little bit. Yeah. Hello. What's your name? And then you're in the background. And also I think the funny thing about having you as a partner, I mean, the only good thing is that, you know, you look, you. You look weird and tall, like too freakishly tall and lanky. But in that one, though, because your background and your smiling, you don't look as weird as you do in real life or as freakishly tall. So it sort of ruins it a little bit for me. Look, Pilkington, he's not listening. He's just opening a packet. What are they? MCVit is. See, we should mention them. We get some free ones if anyone at McViT is a listening, because we're not getting the perks of this. Nothing. I tell you, I'm not getting anything. I really got in this game for the ladies, for the money, for the voiceover work. So. Yeah, I'm seeing hide and hair of that. But, um, you're not getting the voice over because Jethro. The jethro's getting all this part that you might get. Yeah, sure, sure. Yeah. Okay. Rick. Yeah? You were the voice of what? The drink driving campaign. You sound like, you sound like a man who was run over in a drink drive accident. I mean, it's like you don't. I didn't get any money for that. You drink. Oh, did I? I can't remember. It's like I mean, I don't drive? Yeah. No, it said don't drink and drive. So I've chosen just to drink. I can formulate sentences using the English language and I'm not getting the voice over work. What's it. What? Yeah, the english language of the 14th century. Well, it's better a English language and English language rather than whatever kind of middle England language you speak. The language of the hobbits. All right, Carl, see you. Eat a biscuit. I can't believe it. Are you bored with this already? You know what? MTV called me last week. They called me again yesterday and said, when can they come down to do it? Oh, they're coming down next Saturday, by the way, to do a little screen test for you. They're gonna sort of just film you with a little camcorder. You said this. They're gonna film you. Are you right? Do you wanna. I mean, you hungry? Do you want to go out and have a meal? I can't believe you're eating while I'm on air. No one can hear that. Do you know who I am? No one can hear. Explain who I am. Well, that's Ricky Gervais, right? He's made his name on tv. Yeah. Okay. He's done any number of corporate gigs which. And they pay silly money. So, I mean, this guy's earning, you know, and really earning beyond his talent. All right? So I think I deserve a little. Bit more than a little mank. Eating a biscuit while I'm talking. Rich of ace. Yeah. Have you won a bafta? Yeah, too. All right, so just a little bit of respect. Yeah. Yeah. What have you won? What have you won? I got a. I got a bronze certificate for doing a full week at school. It was only a bronze. What's that then? Three out of five days. Badge, if you. If you remember. What? The Crusaders badge for the religious club. So I was at the feather that you went and played. You had to go talk to you about God. Yeah. Yeah. You got a crusaders barriers, did you? Yeah, that's why I won. That's why I joined. That's why I joined for the little badge. Did four weeks, then packed it in. But we're talking about MTV, right? And I was feeling a bit nervous about like, you know, the way I look, right, and what have you. And then I watched a bit of celebrity big brother and all the fuss that Mark Owens getting. And he's not. He's not that good looking, is he? Very. I want to be Mark Owens, mate. If anyone who knows Mark Owen or Mark Owens listening. I want to be his mate. I think he's brilliant. I think he's a nice lad. But what I'm saying is, right, all the girls go mad over him. Yeah. And he's not. He's not that good looking, is he? Well, he's got us to. Isn't a certain way, isn't he? That sort of non threatening? So. Yeah, but he's not. He's not stunning, is he? Know, what's your definition of a stone? Someone who you look at and you go. Go there. They're good. What bloke do you think's attractive, then? So if I was into men. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, you can. You can still say a bloke's a good looker without probably. Oh, I mean, it depends what you're looking for. Would you say was like stunning in your definition? A good looking lad? Yeah. Good looking lad. Oh, look at him over those. Oh. Would you find, you know, Robbie Williams? Do you find him? Boy next door? Look. No, no. Carl, hurry up, because it's, you know, we've only got 2 hours probably. Do you know, I can't think of one I found. Mark Owen is pretty good looking then. Really? Just name one bloke that you think is an attractive guy. There must be one bloke that you've either met or that you've seen in a pub on a poster. Tell you what, go on. Tell you what works here. Young Alex zane. Brilliant. I love that. That's like a ride song or something. That's my favorite feeder. Just the way I'm feeling on XFM 104.9. Quick question for you. I'm thinking a lot of people may maybe are tuning in for the first time because of the advertising campaign. Should we reintroduce Carl again? I know we've done this a few times in the past, but just worry that people are going to not, you know, not really. Kind of get the measure of him. Yeah. I'm Ricky Gervais. The one off the office. Yeah. Steve Merchant. He's not the one in the office. He's not. He's not Gareth. Some people think he is. He's got a funny, weird west country accent that actually Mackenzie was affecting for the role. Steve wrote it with me. He's a tall, lanky fella. Carl is our sort of, I say producer, but he's the one that pressed the buttons because I was dog's body. Yeah, but I mean, it's just because I was too big to run the desk. Yeah. Like I used to have. Literally too big you could get. Yeah. And then we discovered that, you know, he looked a bit like a boring sort of all right. Yeah. But then when we sort of, you know, poked him with a stick, he came up with, he doesn't realize. But some of the, I think some of the funniest things I heard say, hello, Karl. Yeah, well, classics, I think, so far. That have gone straight to the list include. Have you ever used a Y front correctly? Yeah, brilliant. You never see an old person eating a twix. Eating a twix. These are sort of things. He's back on his campaign to get rid of jellyfish. What is that, Carl? Did you see the paper yesterday? Go on. It's a jellyfish. It's about 15 foot long, about five foot wide, and there's a fella swimming next to it and the paper's going, oh, look at this. We found, there's loads of them in Japan and it's because the water's getting hot, so it's making jellyfish really big. Oh, dear. How's the campaign going to get jellyfish rid, you know, get rid of them? What's your point about jellyfish? There's no, don't do anything. There's no point. They get in the way. It ruined me holiday because I got stung by one. Yeah, and. But you think the same thing about liverpudlians. And we can't just go around, you know, wiping out things that ruin the. Jellyfish first and then we'll move on to the scousers. Yeah, but, yeah, I don't know what they do. And I'm still, I mean, I'm trying to look on the Internet. I've been busy this week. You're jellyfish now, not scousers. Yeah, yeah. I don't know what they do either. Try and work out what would happen with the sea if it didn't work because they say, like, if there's no. Sea, there's what we're talking about. Let's do it. People listen. First time, they've got to listen to every word you say. You want to find out what would happen with the sea if it didn't. Work, if jellyfish weren't in there. Do you know what I mean? Because stuff like coral, apparently the sea would be in a right state if you didn't have any coral. Yeah, right in it. Fish. I mean, I always worry about how many fish we're sort of eating. Did you go past? Sorry, no. Do you know, like, you go in Marks and Spencer's or selfish. There's loads of fish in there and. There'S really fancy stuff that you think they've killed that and it looks good on the count are pretty impressive. Yeah. But is anyone gonna buy it? Yeah, I mean, it's a big. Like a shark sat in ice. Yeah. And you go, yeah, they've got. They've got, like, a lot of fish, for sure. You won't go around the Tate gallery. Do you know what I mean? I've never seen a big shark sat in ice in Selfridges. They do. They do it. And it's like you go in the morning and you can go back at night and the same shark sat there and it's. You know, it's the same shark. Do you? It's the same one. Same face. Are you sure? He just hasn't lost his mum and he's just like. He went shopping with a Christmas shopping, and he's just like. He's stranded. He doesn't know where. He's just waiting. You know I'm right. I've never seen a shark in Selfridges. Well, all right, then. Say, maybe that's one day a week, but on all the days, like shark. Monday, today at salvages is shark Monday. Yeah. No, it's just that. Your point is that there's all these fish not being eaten. Yeah. So they've been killed. They've taken them out of the sea. No one's eating. And you're worried what, that the sea's gonna rise because the more things you take out. Well, we're just gonna run out because. The fish drink it, don't I? And that keeps the water level down. Yeah. No, you know. You know what I mean? This stuff. This stuff that worries me. Worried. That was it. You said that you were worried that because, you know, there's sponge in the sea. Yeah, but if they took it all away. No, that's a Stephen Wright. Is that Stephen Wright? What's the joke? Sponges grow in the sea. That kills me. How deep would it be if they did that? I love the fact that he confused you with Stephen Wright, who, for a living, purposely says ridiculous things. Does that worry you, Karl? Well, think about that player. Record what you want. I'd love to. A classic. A beautiful song by Simon Agatha called April come she will. April comes she will. Simon Agathon call. That was in the days when they kept songs short. Short and sweet. What do you think of that, Carl, as a track? Yeah. Good one. Yeah, yeah. Excellent. So, yeah, so that. That's. That's Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington coming up. On the show we've got educating Ricky. I'm not happy with this. Oh, really? Because the last few weeks have been genius. What is. What is the drop in quality is there of the education of me? It's just like I said, I've wasted a lot of time this week searching on the web. Right. You waste a lot of time searching on the web because you come up with things that aren't true. Why don't you look in books and verified, sort of like journalists. What is the new book, though, innit? No, the web is the new book. So I've been searching as hardly anything. I spoke to you in the week about Monday or Tuesday. What did you say? There's nothing happened this week in the world. There's nothing going on. There was a new car wash that you can put dogs in. There was a car Washington. That's the only thing that's happened in the world. And that. And the jellyfish. And we've covered that. So. So we've got. Yeah, we've managed to find some bits, but it's not that good. Rock busters. Yes. We've really g'd up. So that's coming up, the thing that's not that good. Yeah, yeah, look forward to that. Can you just quickly tell us about the car wash with the dog in it? That didn't make the top three. I didn't waste that much time on it, to be honest. It just said, you know, how busy are you? Have you got a dog? How about saving some time? There's some car wash out. It's not car wash, it's dog wash. You take it down there, put your coin in, put your dog in and it comes out clean. See? There's nothing in it. Is this called a bath? Isn't it? No, but it's like a machine, right? There's a machine, but. But we'll look, you know, that's why I didn't pick it. We've got some of them vents coming up. Rock busters. Yeah. Rick, can I just explain some of the prizes we got here for rockbusters? Because I just want you to try and picture, if you would, the kind of XFM listener who particularly want this collection, this collection of. You've got the best chill out album ever. This is the one, as I said before, that's largely made up of songs you may have heard in adverts. Sure. So you've got the Volvo advert on there. T Mobile, TV. T mobile. Brilliant. That's on there. So that's right. So look forward to that, yeah. Again, just imagine which XFM listener is particularly looking forward to. Top of the morning with Terry Wogan. His two discs set there you've got. It starts with them. We've got the bangles on there. We've got Billy Joel, river of dreams shine on by Mister Christaber. So look forward to that. We got the only fools and horses, last year's Christmas special. We gave one of those away last year, last week. But still more to shake a little free. Yes, it's free. Three wheeled Trotter independent trading three wheel car. So that's there as well. So as I say, if you, if you, if you like fairly little Jonathan. Ross's face there on the back, maybe. You also want Jerry Halliwell's body yoga DVD, Rick, so. Sure, yeah. Good quality. And then just a few token XFM kind of things. We've got the manic street preachers DVD and the YouTube. And tell me, Steve, how do the lucky winner listeners win these? Rick, I'm glad you've asked. What they do is they email in with the answers to Rockbusters, which is a quiz. Know the email address. Again, thanks for asking. Thanks for flagging that up. Ricky Gervais co dot uk. That will be coming up shortly. Try and get into the mindset of Carl Pilkington. A lot of people have been trying to email in answers, trying to think through kind of logically or maybe based on the rules that they've picked up over the years. When he says it corrected clue. They believed him. Exactly. Yeah. So you've just got to think more like a mentalist to try and get. First of all, right, the prizes that I source every week. Explain yourself what I said to you we're doing between now and Christmas, because it's just a few weeks till Christmas. Right. I thought I'd make up sort of family packs. Okay. That the winner can have something say like there's a nice u two album in there, right? So the winner might want to keep that, but they can get rid of the Jerry yoga thing. They've only fools nurses to uncle. The dad. The dad. Yeah, the mom. I think the mum would love the Terry Wogan. Yeah. The yoga for your sister. Right. Yeah. And all that. So is that, is that, that's, that's what you, you thought through, was it? Or was it that there was a load of junk, the arm or did. You scoop them up with two arms and it's as much you could carry down the corridor. Yeah, a little bit of that. Yeah. But that's me. That's me workings on. Why you've got all that. Brilliant. That's excellent. That's coming up. And my mum sent some more. What we also need from his mom. My mom did some more rock busters. For us, I reckon either. I reckon they're secretly listening, Carl. They've said they're not listening, but I reckon they are. Does that worry you? Well, let's play a record and let's hear this whole bum's rockbusters. Better warranty regularly. Nirvana, you know. You're right on XFM 104.9. I had to meet the doctor for the. For this fight thing in the week and it's the one who's off. Big brother. Psychiatrist. Yeah. And. But she's a medical doctor. She's sort of big in the, in the boxing sort of world as well. And then one of the tests I do a punch test, the other test I had to do was to get in the BoD pod, you know. Yeah, yeah. And he wiped it down since he was. Yeah. And I was a little bit nervous. And so what does this do? What exactly does it do? What it does, you do a displacement sort of calibration with a known volume. All right, just bear in mind that Carl's listening, so if you want to bring that in. What it does, Carl, is it works out your density, okay? Through displacement. It knows how much what your volume is for the air displaced, right, in this, in this thing. And in layman's terms, what does it tell you? What? It works? It tells you. Well, it knows. It knows what muscle weighs, it knows what fat weighs. It knows your average density of your skeleton, what height you are there. So it works out from your volume and your density, it can work out, therefore, probably what percentage of that is muscle, fat, bone, etcetera. What if you put in one of those. Go on, then. No, go on. What were you going to ask? What would it do if you put in one of those pug dogs? What do you mean, what would it do? Like on Ricky's lap? No. Do you know those dogs that are all wrinkling have got too much skin for the skeleton? It's all like caving in and folding over. Would the machine go, well, we know what you are, so it's all right. Or would it say, oh, what's going on here, Jamie? Like last week when you were. Why do you want to confuse machines? Remember when he put in y to a computer searcher to try and confuse it? I love the fact I want the computer to come back. Why not? And your head explode. I mean, I love the idea that you're trying to. I mean, it's better than what I. Thought you were gonna say, which is, what if you put a fly in there? But anyway, so, anyway, what percentage of. You is muscle and what percentage of you is fat? I'm 25% fat. 25% fat? Yeah. Now, what's written most of me is muscle bones. Don't see that. Rick Waller was 60% fat, which I've looked into it and apparently is exactly the same as a pork scratching. Wow. That's extraordinary. So he is the equivalent of a 30 stone giant pork scrunching. So it's 20% fat. Is that good or bad? No, 20% is. All right. 25 is over. Right, men. Healthy, fit, lean men, about 1820. So you're a healthy fit now. 1812. 25. Oh, you're 25. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So I'm 5% over and a boxer. A boxer that is in peak. You know, with that, basically, you've seen the ones. They just look, you know, like Bruce Lee. They're 8%. 8% fat. So is that good for you? Well, I don't think it's that bad. I mean, you know, you need a Bruce. Bruce, like Bruce Lee, supposedly. I mean, there's many rumors. I'm sure you're fascinated by them, Carl. Conspiracy theories surrounding Bruce Lee's death, one of which is that his body was. It's at the peak of physical perfection. He had an aspirin because of a headache and it reacted with his. Because just the impurities in the aspirin killed him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because it's sort of, like, quite interesting and a bit weird. Yeah, that's fact it, love. Yeah. Well, are you aware of the fact that supposedly he actually cheated death, he actually faked his own death so he could work undercover for the Hong Kong police. You aware of it? Yeah, yeah. Do you believe that as well? Not so. Looks like a video. Now, do you believe he could kill. A man by putting all his energy into a trembling hand and touching him and every blood vessel burst? Well, it's just another form of trickery, innit? I mean, you met up with. With Darren, didn't you? Met with Darren Brown, yeah, Darren Brown, yeah. He's incredible. He's probably the Britain's best illusionist, if you don't mind me saying. Yeah, you can put that on a poster if you want. Tell you what, though, right, changing the subject a bit. We're talking about a fly getting in that pod. Yeah? Yeah. Read in the week when I was searching for stuff to educate. You know the educate Ricky section. Yeah. Which we will be doing. That phone, it's annoying me. Who's phone in? Obviously someone who doesn't know that you're talking at the moment to leave it. It could be. It could be, um. Leave it. It could be the head of. Leave it. Yeah, go on. Could be the end of XFM. Yeah. No, I won't embarrassing him. I going, don't call me when I'm working. Ice aged against the machine. Yeah, right. We're talking about flies getting in a pod and you know, like how Barbie doll. If it was real, it wouldn't be able to work a Barbie doll if a woman had the proportions. Yeah. She tie shoelaces up and stuff because her legs are too long for a back and all that. Flies. Scientists can't work out how they fly. It's a bee. It's a bee. It's a b. Not a fly. No, fly as well. No, a fly is. Apparently its body is like too big for its wings and they still can't work out. Yeah. Which. Which in your mind says what? Something spooky. They have worked out that they. It. The fact that what they did, the wing actually beats ridiculous about 150 times a second. So it displaces air. Yeah, I know. You mean. I don't mean it's. It's incredible that it can fly because it's got such small wings. Yeah. A all right. Yeah. But other than that. Good point. Bowie. Ah, another classic. Be my wife off the low album. David Bowie. David Bowie. Be my wife off a low. Very good indeed. Yeah. You know my frustration with the homeless. Yeah. You know, they wind me up walking through Soho last night I saw a homeless fella reading a book. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you this, if he's got the wherewithal to read a book, he's obviously, you know, he wants to keep himself occupied. His mind occupied, his mind educated. My point is why not instead of reading the book, have a quick look through the job vacancy section of the Evening standard? Or maybe just take the time to fill in some kind of application form for, you know, maybe, you know. Is the ability to read with the ability to house yourself? Well, no, because what I'm saying is it seems to me he's obviously got a certain, you know, grasp psychologically of. You know, is where people, a lot of them are. Rick, I see dancing and shouting and screaming, you know, and pissing in doorways and stuff. Yeah. You're confusing the homelessness with trampiness. Well, again, you know, some people just. Have left home and they haven't got. I'm not a sociologist, sorry if I can't spot all the clever distinctions that trained experts such as yourself can. Well, all I know is there was a fella reading a book. Well, you know, you know the ones that have got beards? I sing little tunes and they're my favorite. Yeah. They're drinking special brew. Yeah. First of all, that's an alcoholic tramp. You know, the ones that sit with a dog or sell. Big issue. They just. They just haven't got their own place. Right. Do you see? Okay, well, again, I mean, there's. Because I. Is tricky finding the place. I know, because I get to move house recently and it's a nightmare. I had to get like estate agents on it and I had to go and see a load of places. And I was doing a job as well, you know, I still managed to fit it in. This guy's just lounging around on the street. Yeah. So I'm surprised you find loads of places to it. I'm surprised he can't find the time to visit a couple of different residences because there's some pretty cheap ones, you know, if you go kind of a bit farther out of London, maybe it's because he wants to live in the Soho area. And frankly, I'm confused about is the number of homeless people that recognize me and say they enjoy the office. They've got to be watching it through Dixon's window. I think that's probably demographic that sort of hung over from some of your previous tv work. 11:00 show. Yeah, you know, or stuff like that. The ones that used to sleep. Yeah, exactly. Tramps. And the French for me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe. So people who watched, you know, have watched the show and then have fallen on hard times since then. I don't know. And this is not necessarily linked. No. Wouldn't have thought so. Carl's lost. Carl's lost in this conversation. Carl, we boring you then? No, no, it's just. I don't know, it's a bit tight in it. What? Because he's like. I. I sometimes think it could have been me when I. When I see homeless people and that. I just think, you know, I nearly killed a man once. It could have totally changed me life. For a second. Just back up for a second. That time when I was in Wales, right, I picked up a big piece of slate and chucked it off for the cliff and it. Nearly a fella. Yeah. Right. In that split second, if he would have decided to sort of go and pick up a shell that was closer to the sea. It could have hit him. Yeah. It would have killed him. And I won't be sat here today. Yeah. I mean, yeah, so it's just all about looking it, right. Yeah. I mean, so Danielle, that's about it really. That's, that's the point. That's the political point again, that therefore. Yeah, no, he's saying, he's saying, you know, you should count our blessings because, you know, anything can happen. Yeah. You never know what's around the corner. If Carl had met us, he'd still be in that little room making jingles. Now he is a respected household name. Do you think he packed the book before he left home to become homeless? He thought, right, I need the clothes, I'm gonna need the cigarettes. We need the dog and the piece of string. And I probably need some, probably gonna need some reading literature as well cuz I'm gonna get pretty bored, like just sitting in the street begging all day. Maybe I should take up on some of the stuff I haven't read, you. Know, or maybe it's doing those themed holidays, you know, they're trendy middle class people, right? They go on like the adventure holidays and danger holidays. Maybe the latest one among sort of like yuppie types. Yeah. Is homeless holidays. Yeah, they pay like 10,000 pounds exactly. And they really get a little sort of the. And people come up to them and abuse them. Yeah. They're all, they're all actors. Yeah. Yeah. They get beaten up at night when they're sleeping under a breed. They get to try a really safe sort of form of heroin. Sure, that sounds brilliant. That's worth marketing. Holidays. Holidays like that home you could have homeless. Yeah, you could have like rent boy holidays. A little bit of money on the. Wean them off it at the end. They go, no, don't keep, don't keep sucking it. You can stop, finish now. You've got. Yeah, you're a bank manager again. I've just got the taste for it, to be honest. Can that happen? No, it's worth knowing if that is a possibility. Carl's worried. Well, we haven't said anything. We just haven't said anything wrong, Karl, don't get me. No complaints. We haven't said anything. The word suck as far as I can work out. No, it's not a banned word on the radio, is it? Rockbusters time? Okay, yeah, rockbusters. Well, let's play a tune and we come out with rockbusters. Hear your mums before best holiday I've ever had. I'll get a taste for it. That's a new american band called my morning jacket from the sweatbee's ep. That's called low down. Like that? Yeah. Nice. It's good, yeah. Um, I brought in some adverts, my favorite adverts to play. Really? Yeah. That's all. They're all new ones as well. We got those now. Can we hear them? Do you want to do them now or keep them listening to them later? No, do them now. Yeah. Oh, they are good. Ready? Xfm. Xfm indeed, Steve. Absolutely. Sorry. What are you looking at? Well, I just look at some of the emails and if I can find it, I got an absolute treat from you. Go on. Dicky Anderson. Richard Anderson. Our biggest fan. Biggest fan, he said. Dear Ricky, sorry for not tuning in recently, only I've been busy watching a puddle evaporate. Glad to hear you haven't tinkered with the show's winning formula by trying to introduce any quality into it. That's from Richard Anderson. So good to have Dick Anderson listening again because he just keeps us on our toes, you know? Yeah. And good work, Rich. Thanks for that. I wonder what he looks like. Dicky Anderson. He's a good looking guy. For some reason, I've always imagined him as being slightly older, with maybe a beard. Oh, no. I think of him sort of cords and now. And sweater. Definitely cord. I think he looks like maybe the proclaimers. Yeah. But again, with a beard or at least a mustache. Yeah. Why? I'm seeing some kind of facial. And he's sort of like. He sort of. He likes the cure and the swissnap, but. And he snars at everything. He thinks everything's pure. Oh, yeah. I bet he prefers radio five, do you think? Radio five? Yeah, five, yeah. Yeah. And I bet he's a real music snob as well. I bet it's like, there's certain bands. It's like rubbish. The blazing squad rubbish. All pop music. Roast Britney Spears rubbish. Is this. Is this defamation? A character? Um. He slacked you off enough times, Rick and the show. I don't know. Saying it's my opinion. I imagine so, yeah. I mean, you know, he could be lovely guy. I'm getting to be honest. I'm getting to like him. What I like about Richard is he's. Willing to say what he thinks. Well, it's not. It's more than that. It's a bit like Evan M. No, it's. No, it's more than that. He actually hits on the truth too often for my liking. Yeah. Well, I mean, this is a shoddy show with very, very little to offer. You got to remember, though, it is a bronze winning show. We did win a bronze award at the Sony's last year, one of the most coveted of the awards. Yeah. In my opinion, the bronze is slightly better than the gold. A lot of people don't win the bronze, Rick. You've got to remember that. There's not many people who see gold. Gold's got no intrinsic value, it's just a currency. And in my opinion, bronze is better in a way. Carl. Rockbusters Carl. Yeah. No, we did get a bronze, but this year we introduced rockbusters. Things will be changing. We didn't introduce Rockbusters Carl. Please don't tar us with that brush. Yeah, you remember that? Remember the show that got that bronze was the show with the complaint that was upheld by the radio authority. Was it really? Yeah. The show that got. That got the award and was nominated was the one with the only upheld complaint we've ever had. Do you think if we hadn't discussed that particular subject for quite as long, we could have got the silver? I think it was a mention of, and I say this, meaning male birds of all the cocks. Yeah. But do you think the Sony committee was going, I enjoyed the show. If they had mentioned cox. Yeah. Meaning birds. Yeah. These birds. Yes. I'd have given it the silver. Yeah. So, getting nervous. Rockbusters, then. Chance to win. All that stuff Steve was talking about. Before we give initials and a cryptic clue and it's a band and there's three of them and you email in Ricky Gervaisfm dot co dot uk. Do you want some of my mums? Well, I think before you give us your own, we should hear your mums. Just to sort of set the tone and for you to get their heads. Around the whole sense of all. They're still not that up to scratch. First one. This group are nice on toast. Marvel. A jam. Yeah. Which one? Jam. Okay. Marbulated would have just as good. Yeah. This man liked his wine. This man liked his wine. Dean Martin. So no cryptic Lou, just a man who drinks. Yeah. I don't think anyone would have ever got that. That's fantastic. This man liked his wine. D nine. This man liked his golf. Oh, clubby, clubby. Oh, clubby. Chip face. No. Bunker Smith. Bean Crosby. Yeah, he likes his golf. Yeah. That's genius. This man wants his wine. Just a couple more. Hope you're not speeding when you meet these. The police. Oh, it's great. See any other good ones? Sounds like these lads work for the hospital, the porters. Say that again. It sounds like these lads work for the hospital. Jerry and the pacemakers. I have to say, if there was ever in the future any doubt that you were your mother's son, that would pay that you are a chip off the. Well, let's, um. Let's, uh. So we have a little record and then educating Ricky and rockbusters of the prizes. Jerry Halliwell's yoga video DVD. I think it's the latest one in that particular series. So if you've already worked yourself up to, you know, you're looking pretty good, but a little bit of flabberg. We ran the arse or breast area. Then Jerry can help you out there. Yeah, we got only fools and horses. This is the Christmas special from last year. Jonathan Ross was giving that one his morning show this morning. I don't know if they're just trying. To get out of him. Top of the morning to you from Terry Wogan. That's his 2d CD. I'm sure they were given that way. You've got the likes of love theme from Top Gun, obviously. Take my breath away by. Brilliant. That's on there. What else we got? We got the pretenders you mentioned there earlier. Alison Moyes on there. Annie Lennox featuring Paul. I still call her Alf. Loaf is on there. I'm talking to the meat variety. Miss Tina Turner on silent wings. There's a incredible selection there, perfect for, say, mom or a deaf aunt. That's the magic street features. Anyway, I was your aunt, the one who farted for five minutes. Carl also got the YouTube. What's up with her? The best chair album. Yeah. Okay, guys, so that's the prizes up for grabbing. I think we're a little bit too relaxed in this show. I mean, people tuning in, we'll just think, do those three people know they're going out live? Or is that a conversation, like, between the records? It's. Do you know? I mean, it probably sounds like. Yeah, the record is playing. We get the record play. We're just chatting. Oh, dear. What we got? What we got, Carl? What we got, Carl? Come on. One moment, Eminem. Lose yourself back on form. There you. Good? Go. Good on XFM 104.9. Rickety Germany. Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. More importantly, Carl, come on in. Right. I need some education. I know it's rockbusters. I know. I need education. I need. We've promised some rockbusters, educating Ricky. I will be ditching before Christmas. Why? It will be going. Why? Because there's nothing out there. Just struggling. I was thinking on the way in today, I can either do doing something more with Steve because we've done like the Ricky angle. Either we can do. No, either like a bit of a call my bluff type thing, but it's like a con merchant and I have to, like, trick you. Okay. And you're the merchant. And then, oh, I was thinking something that you just do do some work and you have a moan for a bit and that's a bit that. That's like a wine merchant, that you just like wine on about something. Again, the pun comes first. Like that first, yeah. That's like come up with a couple of sitcoms for me. One is I've got an imaginary navy called merchants. Navy. Navy in the premises. I've got a navy. Another one is I live. And that's as far as he's got as well. That's all I come up with. If you've got any ideas there, Carl, that'd be much appreciated. Another one is I live in quite a salubrious part of north London and that's called merchant of little Venice. And I live in little Venice again, I don't know what happens. I don't know what happens, but any ideas, Carl? I got one when I play an italian waiter and it's called shut up. A gervais. Yep. So that's the one. We're working there, actually to follow up with the office. Do you like that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll do something with that. Yeah. But at the moment we've got rock busters. Okay, so these are mine, number one. You've been dunking that for too long. That's Lb. Nine. Oh, God, that's too easy, that. Always tease them, don't I? Give them something to make them feel like they're gonna win something. And then I hit them hard with. A tricky one that doesn't make sense. Yeah, go on. So the first one. So that's the cryptic clue for a band or an artist. Their initials are Lb. And the cryptic clue, you've been dunking that for too long. Yeah. So that's the first 1 second one. You won't be able to play that game in this pub because the table ain't big enough. Could be an old artist, could be a new one, could be a boundary. What's the initials? FD. All right, F D. You won't be able to play that game in this pub. The table ain't big enough. And the final one, well, I've had a rubbish day, so I'm happy it's over. Right, that's. That's the third cryptic clue, the initials being G K. Right? Yeah, well, I've had a rubbish day, so I'm happy it's over. They're the three clues. All you got to do is email in. Ricky, that's great. That's genius. Which one? Last one. All right? That is genius. That's the best one you've ever done. Right, Ricky. Doctor Gervais, that's great. UK. Emailing them. Three answers. You win the stuff. We have still got educating Ricky. I'll give you the title. Give me titles. Yeah, go. Right, you've got three bits of info that's gone on in the world or possibly sort of never go further back. In the 17th century, do we? Well, no, let's make it clearer. There's three bits of information that people have put on the net, whether or not they're true, and that he still. Gets it a little bit wrong in translation and sort of adds bits to it. Yeah, go on. So we've got. When he plays out those historical dialogues. So anyway, a bloke says to himself, I'll tell you what I'll do. So the horse isn't happy. Yeah, go on. Right, so the three that you've. You've got a pick from, you've got. Get your kit on. We're off down the butchers. Yeah, let's get your kit on rough. That's as much as. Yeah, we've got, um. Wash up with you. Wash up with you. Yeah. The last one I couldn't really think of a good title for, so it's just. Why don't they just get a diary or some paper or something? We've got to make this into a book. This has got to be a book. After Christmas. Chapter headings Oasis live forever on XFM 104.9. Right. We're in the swing of things. It's my. It's mine. Steve's favorite bit of the whole show. This is what we do this show for now, educating Ricky. Yeah, go for it, Carl. You said learning can't be fun. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I'll go for the one. What's the one about the butcher going down the butcher shop? You've got get your kit on. We're off down the butchers. Yeah, going for that one. Yeah. Well, do you know the saying. Don'T. Let the count the bag? Yeah. Do you know. Do you know what it means? Yeah. Don't give away a secret. Right, well, do you know, it came about. No, well, ages ago. Before. Ages ago. 17th century. Yeah, before, yeah, yeah, 17 is good. Yeah, before, like, you know, proper butchers and jewish and supermarkets and that used to get these blokes who sold meat. Right, right. Butcher. Butchers, they were called dead. Yeah, yeah. But the difference was they didn't stay in the same place. They moved about. Right. So they turn up on a street corner. Right. And he'd have like loads of carrier bags. Of like, carrier bags, yeah. With, you know, with me in and that and people with plastic carry bags. Yeah. So. Yeah, go on. People went, right, yeah, I need some meat. All right. So they go up to this bloke and say, what have you got? They say, well, I've got a, got a, you know, you can have a bag full of pigs or you can have whatever. Bag full of chicken, whatever. And they go, yeah, how much? They go, you know, call it, call it fiverr, whatever. Yeah. And they buy them and to, to make more money. They didn't always fill the bag with what they said was in it and. Yeah, I thought that might be the case. Right. So what, did they put cats in there? Yeah, but I don't see what, what. Okay, so sometimes they would put a cat in the bag pretending was chicken or whatever else. Yes. Why is a cat any cheaper than a chicken? Because cats are wandering around the streets. Aren't the chickens out? So they get a chicken. They put a chicken on the top so that when they look in it, they go, yeah, that's all right. Got a bag full of chicken. They'd get home to make the dinner and they'd be like, what we have in tonight? And they'll go, well, you never guess. And they'd have like, you know, well, you can have a chicken leg and. You know, they'd have to defrost a pizza. Did they mind that they were eating catlin in those days? He didn't say it, just was saying about the saying, don't let the cat out of the bag. It's like, you know, if they see that, they're gonna go mad. I'm mildly disappointed with this story. It's alright if it's true, but you know something about. It's just, I want to know more. He always leaves. It's a. Carl doesn't quench your thirst for knowledge, he creates more. I don't know if that's a good thing or not. Well, yeah, he's like the pot noodle of information. Yeah, he never, I want to go nourish by it. It's. For every fact he tells me, there's ten others that spring up, but I have to get clear. So it was the people that were doing this. It was the. It was the dodgy butchers that coined this phrase. Were they saying to each other, don't let the cow, the rag ie. What I mean by that, Jack, is don't let them see the cat. Yeah. What we stuffed in there. Dodgy butcher. There's another phrase. So that's. That's the first one. As his meat delivered around the back. Sure. So that's, that's that one. So let's get your kit on. It's a euphemism for homosexuality. Okay. And meat, presumably. And that means different things. It doesn't it. It's. It's a word that is also a. Male bird, chicken or cat necessarily, in that context. Or. I suppose it could. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Carl's looks. Just looks. Look at him. Carl looks at you like a cat. Whenever we leave him behind. If we don't talk, like straight at him and let him see our lips moving and it's, you know, monosyllabic and very sloth, he's lost in that conversation. They just drifted off, didn't you, Carl? No, I just was also thinking on animals and that something else was going to use. Go on. Was, this isn't a radio show, is it? I just suddenly caught. This is not. This is nothing before. It's been bad today. No, but I mean, it's the way that. This casual way that it's like we almost have no regard for our listener. And I'm not proud of that. I just don't know what to do about it. Do you know what I mean? I don't know how to do this properly. I mean, we're just chatting here. I mean, it's only Anderson who's seen through us. And that surprises me that more people haven't. I mean, what are the figures like? Do people listen to this show? I'll find out for you. You keep saying that, but, yeah, there's this parrot. Apparently. I mean, Rick is unique, if nothing else. I mean, when you wake up with welcome tomorrow, you're not even gonna hear him start alive. There was this parrot. Go on. There was this parrot. Yeah, go on. And it can talk and that someone's obviously, you know, toy out speaking that and it flew away and it's living in this church and people are at the church doing hymns and that troubles brewing in between. If that parrot was owned by an old miner. Used to swear a lot. Well, then the vicar is gonna be gonna be really annoyed. That vic. That vic is gonna go on. I just hope he stays quiet, Rick, during the vicar sermons. Yeah, go on. Have you read it? No. Go on. That's what happens during the hymns. It's sort of effing and jeffing and stuff. And everyone's like going, oh, you know, it's quite funny, really. No, it doesn't know what it's doing. Everyone's having a laugh. Yeah, but it's causing a havoc at funerals. Where did this happen? Years ago, John was a much loved man. Yeah. So anyway, so that was another story about Uncle John. Bollocks. Oh, God. I love the fact that when you look at things, you go, that's interesting. The parrot swears at funerals and it stays with you. You see, for a simple man, you retain an awful lot of knowledge. It's just all rubbish. So, you know, I mean, if you. Just replaced all this rubbish with good stuff, you'd be an intellectual, really, because, I mean, your attention is fantastic. So I lose you again there, did I? Was it the word of attention? We've still got wash up with you? Yeah. Yeah. Should we play a record and do wash up with you? Yeah. Play a bit of aqualunger. Aqualunga. All right. That's aqua long. Good times. Gonna call minute. Right, Carl, coming in. Educating Ricky. So don't let the cat out of the bag. That's where that comes from. Comes from a crafty butcher. Right, go on in. So the next little headline is wash up with you. What's up with you? Go on. You want to know about that? Yes. It's a survey that they did. Survey that they did this week. They. Yeah. Some. Some university did some survey. Brilliant. Did a world test on washing up. Yeah. And each country were given 140 pots to clean. Brits were the quickest. Yeah. Yeah. Turkey with the slowest washing up. The Turks. It's not because the little fellows that work in the kitchens with. No. Is it? Pick out reach Spain. Spain were the cleanest and the Germans were pretty good as well. So I don't know where to start, Steve. I don't know where to start with that. It was really light. Right. We've had the parrot, right? These are things that I found from the parrot, right? I've told you about the dog in the car wash, right? You didn't tell me about that. He said there's a car wash for a dog. That's what you told me. Yeah, the parrot. You said there's a parrot. What it's a problem at funerals. That's nothing. That's nothing. It's nothing. Do you understand? And they used to eat cats. What else have we got? There's an elephant in India. We saw feet. Why? Interested? Why? Why? He's trying to take Roy Castle's record. What is it? What is it? Think. It's a elephant. And it was really old. It was about 76. And it had sore feet because it's. Old and they don't like stairs. Roads are bad and that. So they said, what we're going to do. And the town was like, oh, you know, we're used to seeing it around. It's part of the thing, you know, we don't want it to have sore feet. So they got some slippers made for it and it had like a picture of the elephant looking happy, wearing some slippers. I love him. I love Carl, his world. Think. Where do you see this picture? That was on the Internet. Right. That's a lesson, though, for any elephants listening, you know, don't wear stilettos to work if you know, because you can do your feet so that it's. Don't elephants have really bad memories? No, they're really good memories. Oh, do they? That's good, then. No, I just thought they forget where they put them. I thought there was something about elephants having bad, bad memories. It goes on. Where's my slippers? Yeah, I sure left them by the text. So. Sorry. There's a better walk around slippers. Yeah, yeah, there's. That's in India slippers. Those sort of old man ones with the sort of checkers. Well, round ones, I imagine. Yeah, yeah. Big round ones. There was that going on. And is it happening? Is it happier? I mean, does it feel. Please. What else is there? There's a woman who's had a breast insure for hundred and 50 grand. Right, okay. What, third party, fire and theft? Don't know. It just said it had a picture of her with them, like, you know, out. I just thought, yeah, you should get them covered. Look at his little face. He smiles. I'd like to see you on one of the, sort of tv panel games if they could bring back sort of celebrity squares. Yeah. Amazing. Is the center square? Oh, that would be incredible. Or I'm on that countdown in dictionary corner. Dictionary. I imagine him in dictionary corner. Come up with. Yeah. Memdlent. Yeah. What does that mean, Carl? Just anything you want it to mean. What I've got. There's a dog that's got a cough in Singapore because it smokes 20 a day. Right, okay. Another one. That's the last one in it. So I saved the last one we've got is why I don't. Sorry, what was that? Wash up with you? That was it. But they stayed put. The survey of washing pots in. You said who? You said Italy were the cleanest. No, Spain. No, Brits were the quickest. Yeah, we were the quickest, but Italy was the. Spain was the cleanest. Turkey were the slowest. Spain were the cleanest. But why weren't we cleaner? Because we were one. Why were we not paying attention to. We did it. Rubbish. We did it quick. We did it quickly. But. But it was doing it. Was it Annette Newman or Einstein? How. She's quick. Both of them are quick. Yeah, well, they've got like kind of load slaves that do it for him. Did we, did we use. Did we use fairy liquid. Boy skate? He just said, you know, that, that. Who had the softest hand? So I didn't say. We don't get notified that this is taking place. I don't know. I was a kid. No one ever said, you know, we need recruits because we're. We're doing a survey on who can wash the quickest. Are you disappointed in yourself with that one car? It is pretty dull. And that is why we've got to bring in either con merchant. Okay. Or wine merchant or. Shut up with your face. Yeah. Would you be able to, if I asked, if I put you on the spot in the next sort of after the next record, would you be able to give an example of how con merchant would work? I mean, is there something you could do? Just sort of expect record should play record? I can do better than that. What ads go on? Oh, XFM. Travis on XFM 104.9, Rocky drives with me, Steve Merchant, Carl puker to be doing educating Ricky. Right, final one. Come on, Carl. Right, what was it? Why don't they just get a diary of some paper or something to write on? Yeah, yeah. Snappy. I couldn't. Well, I couldn't think of a heading for it. It's basically gone. People who have tattoos have never understood it. Right. That they have something put on their arm. Right, sorry, have we started the educate? Is this part of it? Are you educating me? This is something that will be useful in my life that I didn't know about. Yeah, go on. No, it's just that they've got a machine out that does tattoos. You come up with a design you want and you sort of, this machine scans it and you put your arm in this thing. And you press print or whatever, and then it does the tattoo on your hand or on your. Loads of little needles that follow a pattern. Yeah. Computer. Is it a real tattoo? It's a broad, it's a proper one. The fella said, well, as long as. It goes out, it pierces the skin with it. I just wanted to make one of those kind of, you know, those kind of. No, it must be lots of. Lots of little needles or moving needle that can go. How is this clean, like, in between each person? Dunno, probably. I don't know. Well, no, it's not. It's only that if it's one needle, it's just the head, isn't it? If it's one needle that moves, does it like that? Like loads of little. What are we gaining from a machine doing it? Just because, you know they're gonna sort of mess it up. But hold on, how'd you keep your arm still? Because your skin moves like it's a. Machine strapped to your arm. Right. The tricky thing was in all this, it was the fact that, you know, nobody would let him test it out on anyone else, so he had to do it himself. But did it work? Because the thing is, with a tattoo, eyes, they can see when your skins move and they can see what they've done. They keep wiping it and looking, whereas a machine's just got to trust itself. So I think one needle would. Could go wrong if it was a lot of needle, just that it just came down like, you know, a thousand needles. That was an imprint. Yeah. But obviously I'm asking someone who hasn't delved any further than there's a machine that can give you a tattoo. That's all you've got at the moment, isn't it? Well, I'm. Yeah, basically, that's what you got. I mean, that's. That's what I've got. Because I'm not a fan of tattoos. I don't. But where did you read this again? This was Internet. This was on the Internet? Yeah, it was, yeah. Okay. And I just don't understand why people do it. That's. That's what got me attention, because me. Um. So what about. What have I learned from this? Um, that if you. If you wanted to get one, you know, you can get one done by a machine now, you know, people say machines are sort of taking over and that. And there's another one. But it's just the fact, I mean. I don't know, give us the snappy title of this. This education again. Why don't they just get a diary or some paper or something to write it on? That's why I always think when I see people with. With loads of tattoos, like, there's that fellow who we were talking about the other week in Scotland who was covered 99% in tattoos, it's just like, what have you done that for? Yeah. So, I mean, you can't get rid of it now. You've. You've done it now. Yeah. My. One of my uncles, right, tattoo Stan. He's just caked in them, right. I don't think he's my proper uncle, but it's just like. That'S a province in Russia, isn't it? My dad's got loads of mates who. When you say he's not your proper uncle, I did. You know, like Uncle Stanley. Yeah. I mean, and it was like. It was, um. It had loads of mates like that. It was John the screw. Right? So he either works in a prison or he liked to have sex. Cabbie. Cab driver. Okay. It was Jimmy the app. I don't know. Do we? The hat? Yeah. No, no, there was, um. There was Fred the veggie wasn't a relative. Sorry. Fred the veg used to get us, like, big bags of potatoes and that. Fred veg. There was tattoo Stan, and he was just caked in them. And I used to always look at him thinking, why have you done that? I must have only been like, you. Know, I suppose if you're born with a name like Tattoo Stan. Exactly. You destined like a 1950s gang. I'm worried about, like, I'm worried about. In a bank job. What was his name? The hat. What was his name? Jimmy the hat. I'm worried about Jimmy the hat. Yeah. Not having a hat. I don't understand it. Are you sure he didn't have a hat? Not when I met him. Did he ever wear a hat? I didn't see him that much. Do you think it was a joke? Like, we know when your mate, sort of like, you know, eight foot and huge, you call him little John or tiny. Do you think he never. Yeah. They went, oh, no, I've noticed some about June. Go on. No hat. And I go, true. Let's call him Jim the hat. Jim the hat. Yeah. But me Uncle Stan, he had, like, loads of them. He did. Did them himself. Oh, dear. And it was always things like. It was. He had, like, the cross cut here made in Britain. And if you're going to do them yourself, I'd say at least make sure you're sort of a good drawer. Yeah. And don't do it in a mirror so it comes out backwards. Well, that. That was the other thing. But like, I remember he did. I mean, names are all right. He had like all his kids names down his arm. What are they called? Yeah, that is Dan Junior. Yeah. And Paul shits the bed. I'm trying to. Oh, wobbly Kate. Yeah. Yeah. Frankie never amounts to anything. Oh, God. So, yeah, like. Johnny. I don't think he's mine. I don't even know I'm telling you about. Hey, to be honest, I don't know that if. I don't know, maybe just have to picture this. But my picture. My sister took a hat to take a photo once. He was working in like a. A factory. Not to denigrate people who work in factories, but there happened to be a particularly oddball, kind of lank haired, weird guy living, working in this factory. And he made his own, he did his own tattoos and she took a photo of it because she was so extraordinary. He'd drawn it himself. Now bear in mind, it was the kind of thing you saw when you were doing art when you were like 15. This is the sort of person who designed their own, like, rock heavy rock album cover. Yeah, it's that sort of person. So, I mean, like dragon with breasts. You're not far off, Rick. No, you're not far off. I'll tell you what it was. He had this tattooed on his back. It took up his entire back. She took a photo of it for me. He drew it himself. He had it tattooed himself. And it was just too much detail. Too much detail for a tattoo. It needs to be fairly simple, I think, to make a cute. It was. It was a naked female vampire having a shower. Why was she having this shower? That's why she was naked. Yeah. And so she had. She was presumably. She definitely been out a lot of blood. Yeah, well, she was naked. So you could see her naked body. Yeah. She's quite beautiful vampire, relatively speaking. Yeah. Although the symmetry of her face was somewhat off. Yeah. The only thing I think the gave bad spine was that she had. She did have some pointed teeth. I think that was how you knew she was a vampire. Right. Was she looking, she's having a shower was. Yeah. Very specific, isn't it? He said to the. I said, listen, I want a naked bird. Right. But I don't be gratuitous because we put in a shower. Because then I went, population, I mean, you know, it's justified within the story. She's in a shower. Sure, sure. Yeah, yeah, we'll have that. So, yeah, okay. Any other nicknames your friends of your family had? What was your nickname? Car. Just Pilkie. Because for a minute I thought Carl the veg would have made a lot of sense. Yeah. And what? What? Why has your dad got a little tattoo dopey twat on his arm? Right, we'll do the answers to rock buster's next year. Buzzcocks. Still sounds brilliant. That it is. A cracker from Manchester as well, Carl, so they get a little bit of pride there. Hey, I think one of them is one of my mates dads. Really? Yeah, I think so. What's his nickname? Well, his name was. I don't really want to say his name. Okay, Laurie, his first name was. Yeah, still is, probably. Yeah. Well, you know those little fellas at school that didn't know each other, weren't related and weren't friends? Could be too obvious that they had webbed hands and big heads. Yeah. What was that? Did they have any nicknames? Again, too obvious in it. Go on. Well. Oh, big head. Or, you know. Sure. Oh, I bet you got that juggling from twins. Yeah. Can I just interrupt you guys, because we've just had an email here. I hate to query you, Carl, and you're educating Ricky sections. I know you put a lot. Don't read this. Let me just read it for you. Just had an email here from Olivia, and this has also been corroborated by someone else. I forget who it was. She was just. She just tuned in and she just heard you explaining the expression letting the cat out of the bag. So it was all to do with cats that were put in bags by dodgy butchers? Possibly the 17th century. We're not too sure. Anyway, she claims. Well, let me see. She says. She uses both the words twaddle and crap to your definition. She says, letting the cat the bag is an old shipping expression from when sailors used to get flogged for their misdemeanors. The cat. Letting the cat. It was a kind of whip thing that you keep hanging in a bag below deck. If it was discovered that a sailor had done something wrong, the cat would be let out of the bag and get a whipping. Don't let the cat in the bag. We need to cover something up. She's talking nonsense. No, she's not. That's the truth. Because the one I read about that was, there's not enough room in here to swing a cat. Right. And that was people who worked on a boat. Yeah, that's fine. They could have. Keep going. On about people working on a boat to get those. Things to do with their time. Think how many metaphors have birds in them. And you know it's ridiculous. Why can't you have. You can have as many sounds as you like about anything. Carl. There's not a rule they don't go, we've made one up about the cat and ninetales. Well, cheers for that, Oliver. Olivia. Olivia. Yeah. Don't see your email coming up with the rockbusters answers, so you better give us the answers. Let's give them out. You've been dunking that for too long. That was lb. Limp biscuit. Limp biscuit. Yeah, I got that one. The third one. We'll jump to that one because you've got it. Well, I've had a rubbish day, so I'm happy it's all over. That was GK. That's great. When Gladys knight. Gladys night. Glad it's night. That's brilliant. And the one that you both having a problem with, you won't be able to play that game in this pub. The table ain't big enough fast. Go on. Fats domino. Yeah. What? The domino's. You play Domino's in a pub. The dominoes. Fat pub tables are quite small. You won't be able to play that game in this pub. Fats domino. Rubbish. So do you want to pick a winner? Rubbish. Well, you say it's rubbish, but plenty of people got the right answer. Rubbish. Do you want to go with the. Bunch of slightly rubbish prizes is going to Elliot K from Chicwell in Essex. Well done to Elliott. I just can. Before we go, can we just get an email off Anders? Because I think he must. I think we probably turned him around with his show. I thought so. I think he's going to be saying, coming to us with his tail between his legs, saying, sorry, lads, blinding show. I was wrong. You were right. Yep. Yeah. All right. Song for the lovers is very exciting. Yeah. We haven't had a song for the. The lovers or the ladies for quite some time. Let's. John, Martin, may you never. Let's end with beautiful. We'll see you next time. Bye.",
