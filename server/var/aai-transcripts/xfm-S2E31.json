I mean, it seems to me that life's pretty much the same as it was way back in the sixties when Bob Dylan wrote that song. Got any idea what you're talking about? No idea whatsoever. You don't really know about politics? No, no. Anything about it. Don't even read the papers. Got no interest really. Not particularly informed. My life's cushdy got won some awards and stuff. Doesn't bother me. So. It is a bit worrying. Do I have to get gas masks or something? No, because there are guys out there in Leicester Square today wearing novelty hats. If they don't sort this war out. Oh, well, no one can. Okay, well, not talk about it. You would worry about it. I would worry about it. Well, you maybe Steve. Why? Sort of people who were successful are worrying about it more than other people. Just go on. Well, they've got more to lose, haven't they? Right. No, do you know what I mean? You see, like Bruce Willis on the telly saying, oh, it's not good, is it? And it's because he's got a big house and loads of cars. If you live, you know, on a council estate, it's like, well, if it gets bombed, probably doing us all a favor, we'll get nice new blocks of flats to live in. And that it happened with Manchester with the bomb that happened. And they bombed the Andale center. Did us a favour. Got a nice new marks and spencers in there. So this. Hold on, this puts a whole new twist to the argument when people say bombing the world's poorest countries is wrong. Because I remember the afghan problem was on people saying bombing the world's poorest countries wrong. But it's like home improvement according to you, then. Yeah, because they've got a brand new b and Q. Have they? Overnight. They're popping down there every Sunday. Let's not go on about it. Well, think what you're saying. Yeah, I know my family was killed. But look, a carpet warehouse. Yeah. Do you know, I think, you know, people don't want to hear about this today from us. They want to hear, you know, the new features. The song's a phrase. What song's a phrase? It's the feature we started last week where we take clips of songs, we make up a phrase from the show. I mean, a famous phrase. Last. Last week's world famous phrase was there's this airy chinese kid, you'll remember. Yes, well, it was. It was called crosswords last week, but Phil emailed in a good suggestion. Said call it songs of phrase songs. Phrase songs. Off phrase, but perfect. So are we still going with cheapest chimps? We're persevering with that. We've got some cheapest chimps lined up. We'll be doing that before 03:00. Yeah, great. Again, who else can say that? So good. So for the next 2 hours, everyone should just bury their head in the sand, ignore the world's problems and enjoy features such as cheaper's chimps and songs of phrase. And a better shirring break. Stah class. Trying to stop suddenly in Italy. Tb turing breaks. It's like a rock buster, Carl. Remember the good old days? I know, yeah. Painkiller on XFM 104.9. But look, Rockbusters is gone. Forget rockbusters. Long live songs of phrase. Over to you, Carl. You know, rockbusters was one of the things they were protesting about next. Last time that was why I just had to listen to them. They just kept stopping me in the street as I was trying to get to the tube. You've got to stop rockbusters. It's run out of steam, they said. And I'm glad. That's why they always do it on a Saturday. Yeah. They make their way to Leicester Square for 03:00. Song's a phrase. What it is, song's a phrase. We took a phrase from the show last week. It was. There's this area. Chinese kid. Right. Today we're going back to the good old line of about. You never see an old man eating a twix. Sure. How long is that? No, you'll never see an old man eating a twix. You'll never see an old man eating a twix. Not as many as you think though. It's not that many. Well, how is it not that many? Right, well, first of all. Anyway, don't worry about that. I think there's about five. I think I'm gonna. Why do we leave him alone to do this? I mean, he always. It's like. I tell you what, we were flying six different songs. Six different songs. A lot to get, Carl. But what happened is I couldn't find a song with Twix. So we've changed the chocolate. Oh, this is rubbish. We're not doing it. We're not doing it. No, you've got to be punished. We're not doing this, doing that. No, no, no. Shut up, Carl. No, no, no. He's put a lot of effort in so what? You're right. He's got to do it right. There's too many. We said too many. It's not. It's changed the thing. It's not one of those. It's ridiculous. It's only. Rick. If only his parents had spoken like that to him sometimes in the past. Come on. No, we're not doing it. Steve, what do you think? I'll tell you. We've got the prizes, but I'm not even gonna bother give you share amongst. Right. Homeless. Absolutely. No, there's. There's troubles in the world and I'm not gonna let you faff around doing nonsense like that. It's ridiculous. Let's do. Let's play a beautiful song. What do you think? I'd love to hear great song. Yeah. The times there are change and we said that. Look at. On the run. Look at Mother nature on the run. Steve. Yeah, play it. So we're not doing. No, it's your own fault. Neil Young. Beautiful. The gold rush. One of the most beautiful, poignant songs ever. Great lyrics in that. Look at mother nature on the run in the 1970s. I forget the 1970s, Rick. I'm beginning to wonder if that's just as truthful nowadays, in the year 2003. You've got no idea. You don't know anything about the world or politics. So I don't know why you persist. I don't know why I keep saying it myself, Rick. I'm a political incompetent. I don't know why I keep spouting on with this drivel. Right. It's the Guardian, I think, that's doing it. To me, it's all secondhand information. I just read it in there and I just thought it was a good idea. Exactly. I could get really care about anything in the world. Really something. Exactly. Unless I'm personally affected by these things, I don't care less. Well, I'm the same now, Carl, the big question, as we know at the moment, is whether we're going to let you do songs of phrase or not. Rick, I should tell you now, there has been a flood of. Oh, no, there hasn't. Sorry. I was thinking there'd been a flood of emails, but people agreeing with you, Rick. I know, I know. Tony Blair has been trying to get through. Yeah, exactly. I'm just checking the emails. No, there's absolutely nothing supporting you. No one gives a side either way about. There were a couple of phone calls, weren't there? One was the guy saying, you should. I think the other one was you, Carl. Was it phoning? From the kitchen. Can we do it? Can we do it? No, if you don't like, you won't do next week, but you've made it. I don't know what. I don't know why you did that. I thought of lots of stuff you could do. You chose one where you have to have ten words and six songs to choose. You haven't got twix. I don't know what you've substituted Twix for. Okay. I mean, I got to say, now I'm going to sit on the fence here. I'm quite intrigued. Okay, right. What? What have you substituted Twix for? Well, I can't hear because you can. No, I can't because people have to listen to it and work out. All right, let's just hear it. Let's hear it. No, no, no. They know what. They have to know what the word is. They have to tell what the song is. Although all the art, I prefer just to play it. No, you've got to tell them what it is. They might not even know what word they're looking for. Let's just. Let's hear him out, Rick, please. Democracy, that's what we're fighting for. Come on. Right, you turn them up. Right, okay, I've got the headphones on. Go on, then. Okay, so, right, hang on. The phrase originally was you never see an old man eating the twix. Right. And we're trying to identify the. Well, a number of songs which you've used to make up that phrase. And you email in XFM dot co dot Uk, Ricky, with as many as you can get and whoever gets the most. Right. It's so complicated. This is so complicated. Here we go. I'm baffled by the email address. I couldn't figure that out. Xfm dot co dot UK slash Ricky. Right. And there's some link on there, is there? That. Yeah, you just press and it comes through. Right, here we go then. Right. An old man return. Oh, God. Okay. We'd say the prizes, Steve. Right, so how many songs were there? I think there's six. You think there were six? And you'll never see an old man eat. Five or six. Anyway, email in the answers and how many there were and you might be in with a chance of winning on DVD. The original series of Citizen Smith with Robert Dinsey. That was good. Paul Whitehouse's happiness, the first series of that on DVD. We've also got a couple of CDs here. The best of Brit pop live forever, Alesis, blur, Radiohead and all the rest of them on there. Supergrass is current album as well. I think it's current album. Yeah, it is. And less convinced by this one. If I tell you that some of the artists include a Delamere and Deacon Blue, then I know you'll be rushing out later, Rick, to buy this. Scotland rocks. Is wet, wet, wet on there. Let's see. What happened to bits. Let me see. I'm not gonna. I tell you, doesn't. I mean, we've got gun on there. Oh, yeah. We've got baby lately. Aztec camera. Yeah. Big country. Obviously. Proclaimer's not on there. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Where's Runrig? There they are. There they are. And obviously Rafferty, Baker street. Brilliant. So that's. That's definitely worth entering for, surely. So, XFM dot co dot Uk. Ricky, play it one more time. Yeah, just. Class, pure class. Well done. All right, let go. Oasis, stop crying your heart out on XFM 104.9 on Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl's competition is in full swing. Now, I just will remind you, when playing songs of phrase and trying to guess the. The songs and artists, what do you want? Songs are artists, I think. Songs, yeah. All right. But that's ambiguous, isn't it? What a song title is, where maybe the artist cleans it up. Really? Yeah, yeah, artists, okay. You know, if they know what it is, because that. Stop any ambiguity, won't it? And don't worry if you haven't got all of them because the winner last week didn't have all of them. But it's the closest one. I understand. When you're trying to guess what's in Carl's mind, you can only get so close. Do you know what I mean? He wants us to bring in Darren Brown because he won't be able to read my mind. And I think he's right. I think you might. I think he's the one person that could outwit Darren Brown. Yeah. Now, moving on. Carl, should we just play it very quickly? Just play again, just. If you're joining. Go on in one more time here. It sums a phrase man eater, because you have to get, you know, it is very difficult. So you know song or is. We give points if you're. If you're close, any of those and we choose a winner. So, you know, do. And what the points mean. Crap prizes. XFM XFM UK. Ricky, right now we got people to send in a little thing for you last week, didn't he? The film freaks. You got a few sent in. You watched it, did you? Yeah. Now, I should just point out that the film freaks, for those that don't know, was a movie that was released, I think, in the. Well, actually, it was originally made in about 1932, something like that. And then it was delayed. It was banned for many, many years because it did, in actual fact, feature, for one of a better phrase, real life freaks. Bearded ladies being one of the more kind of familiar ones. There's all sorts. And it was actually quite. It's quite a tender film, isn't it? And actually portrays them as a kind of dysfunctional family. It's not. It's not exploitative in that sense. But what do you make of it, Carl? We were watching it for the freaks. Weren't you? Yeah. I mean, I wish. It does take a while to get onto it. What do you mean? Well, straight away I was disappointed. Right. Because at the start, like, you put it in, it's like, oh, brilliant. There we go. You know, I said to Susan, we'll watch this. Love a good night. Yeah, have a romantic night. Yeah, that's it. Her birthday. You've got your gloves now we're gonna watch some freaks. So put it on. And it starts off, and it's like, you know, the following film, you think? Oh, it's like following films rated 15. Which means, you know, might contain scenes of violence, bad language and sex. Mention nothing about pinheads. Right. So I thought they missed a trick there. Yeah. So I thought, well, let's go. What exactly is a pinhead? Oh, if you've seen it, you know. Okay, right. So, uh. Not the best thing in it either. So imagine that. Okay, so you're watching it. So sat there, I think, right. Something comes on. And the little fellas on there, the little fellow we were talking about, the pillow man, Ross. Is he investing in it now? What's the pillow man again? He's a fella who. Years ago. He's got no arms and legs. Right. Just force it. Just. Yeah. And there's a scene where you seem sort of rolling a cigarette up, just using his mouth. And it's like he likes it and stuff. That's. That's weird. And then what else is on it? And then there's a. There's a little. Little fella on it who is fed up because he looks five, but he's actually 34. Right, right. But there's a woman who is 42 and looked at. So they both have the opposite thing. They were both really fed up. And I kind of thought that shows that, you know, you always want what someone else has got. Sure. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. So in a way, there's a story there. No. That you described the same there. No, no, no. It was like. No, they both used. You just said they. They both looked young, but they are actually both older. No, no. This was like a little man. Yeah. Who was 35. Who was 35 and looked at. Yeah. And so did she. No, all the other way around then. What, so she was an eight year old that looked 35? Yeah. Oh. Maybe not then, anyway. No, but that wasn't that weird. I kind of thought it's slow start on that. Yeah. And then it's not. It's not a difficult film before that. No. Yeah. But I wasn't really listening to what it's all about. Just looking at what they had. And they had, like, a fella who's. Running about like he was shopping, you. Know, they had a fella with no legs, and he's running about on his hands. And so got about on a skateboard talking to someone about it. They said that's how et was done. There's actually a little fella in ET, right. Who's just half of sort of half a body. Is that true? I've no idea. I've never heard that before. Never heard that before. I don't think he would fit in ET because. Where's the head? He's got no neck Et. It's a skinny little thing. There's no human neck. Couldn't fit in that skinny little neck. Wow. Well, you sure it wasn't Kenny Baker up to his old tricks? What are you talking about, Kyle? There's a fellow with no legs in ET. In ET, they had two. Two fellas, right? I think they had a little. A midget fella, right, who did it. And then I think he was off sick, and they were like, oh, you know what else? So they saw a guy on a. Skateboard going by and said, do you want to see some work? Right? And he's done it. I think someone told me. I mean, it might be. Exactly. Might be wrong. It might be. Might. I mean, you've never been wrong before, so I don't know why you've been wrong there. So what's the worst thing in it now? It's intriguing to me because here's a film called freaks, featuring real life freaks, and you're sort of a bit non plus by it. Just because it wasn't. Because it's built up. If you call a video freaks, you got to make sure that there's some good stuff on there. Yeah. What were you disappointed about? Was it that. Because there was a few things on it, right. There was a woman who said she was half man, half woman. And it's like, well, you know. Are you. It was just like she had some makeup on. I thought, well, that's rubbish. And then there was a woman who could eat using her feet. That isn't that freaky, do you know what I mean? If she's not hungry, she looks normal. And that's when I was thinking, I. Mean, I'm not being. Not being right, Steve. You know, I'm not being funny. Oh, here we go. No, no, no. But I'm just saying, if that woman wasn't eating and you were sat next to her in that film. Yeah? I'd probably be sort of drawn to you more than her. I'm not. I know you hate me saying it, but there's no point sort of pretending. Do you know what I mean? Oi, Mutley. What you get. What are you sniggering about? You mean there were things in it that were less. What are you saying? I'm just saying, play a record. Seriously. I'll slap you. I'm gonna slap you live on air. I'm slapping you live on air. I swear to God. Bruce Springsteen, Atlantic City, from the album Nebraska. So melancholy, that one. Wow. So freaks, then. All in all, not. Not as. Not as amazing as you first hoped it was. It was built up too much, do you know? Really? Is that my fault for getting you excited? I believe I hand you this thing on a plate. And I'm not. I'm not being out of order, Steve. I'm just. I'm just being honest. We've always said that about the show. We only talk about stuff, you know. Yeah. You know, being honest than that. Yeah, sure. And I've always said, the first time I saw you, sure. No, no, you've always been honest, and I've always been honest with you. I've always said that, you know, you've got the. You've got the intelligence and insight of a nat. Yeah, but if I. If I keep quiet. People don't know that. Sure. All right. Incredibly, they do call, because you look stupid as well. Wow. You know? Yeah, no, but the car was being nice then. You don't. You know, I'm just saying you're a good bloke and now I've got to know. You sure? Yeah. Yeah. The first time was weird, when I saw. I'm just. I'm just saying, the first time. Yeah, it was weird. And that. And then weeks go by and the weird thing is I kind of thought maybe he's not that odd looking. Yeah yeah. Yeah. And then you went to LA for three weeks. Sure. And when you came back, it was like the first time again. Right, okay. No, stop it now. Yeah, everyone stop it now. No, but I just think I'm a little bit more consistent because I've always thought you were an idiot. I don't want this. Don't argue. He was just. Okay. No, I just, you know. You know what I mean? My opinion has never changed. I've always thought you're in. No no, it's just all nice. Let's look. Let's look. Peace. Shut up. Peace, not war. He's just such a stir, isn't he? I don't think. I didn't see you whispering behind the microphone about what to say to Karl. Look what I've just drawn, Carl, subconsciously. Yeah, let's see. I drew a picture of him. It's not gonna be on the website. It's not been on the website. No, it's gonna be. I do cartoon of him. They're not yours. I'll do one, Carl. Um, right. Okay, what we talking about? How is it? So, yeah, it's over and done with. It was all right if you want to get it out on video, you know, it's probably worth a look. There's a couple of things on there that get you thinking more. You know, it's like how their life is and stuff. Do you know what I mean? How it's affected and like the little pillow man or the fellow who's got half of his body missing. Yeah. You know, it's stuff like that. You think? But what's the one that would disappoint? You said it was a half man, half woman. Yeah. I don't quite understand that one. Do you mean hermaphrodite or half. I can't remember it. You mean there was one sort of like. It had bits of both. It was just like half. Half faced on a makeup and longer than on the other side of it. And it changed. I love the idea that you go to this circus and there's people in there that have been sort of persecuted all their life, and I think, well, maybe I can make some money. And then you boo them because they're not freakish enough. I love the idea they got, boo. You're not freakish enough. Boo. Oh, you've got bits of legs. Boo. Yeah, but there was, I mean, talking about that, you see why did they get joined the circus and that. Because there are things they can do. I was telling you in the week that was reading something on some news website about some sort of Olympic style games where they're gonna see, like, disabled people against able bodies. Right. Let's be careful they. Shall we? No, I'm just saying that. Okay. Do you know, I mean, so there is other things. It doesn't mean just because you haven't got legs, you can't do other stuff. Yeah. And in this race there's like disabled people who are beating able bodied people. Yeah. What would you go and see that? I don't know, but I mean, it depends. What? What do you mean? They're beating them. What, at what? They didn't state what the. What? The little races were in that. Little races. Oh, look, they're disabled with their little races. Would you go? Would you go on? Do you remember when Jimmy thought that Paralympics stood for paraplegic Olympics? The Paralympics? Yeah, it means parallel Olympics. Yeah. Yeah. He thought it meant paraligic. Paraplegic Olympics. That would be a good site, wouldn't it? Mainly blow football. Right, right. Okay, so what was that thing I told you to look up in the week? You were saying. I don't believe you were going on about. We were talking about the half man, half woman. Yeah. And you were saying you can get. You can get a sex change on the NHS just to see what you say about that. Did you look it up? I didn't, because I think I was wasting my time. I don't think I'm giving all these things little. You wouldn't do that. You do. You've annoyed Steve. You've annoyed Steve on air. I'm sorry about that. Well, it's just too late, Carl. But we were talking about other stuff as well. I mean, you know, talking about operations and that. You were saying, you know, can you have a sex change done on the NHS and that? No. You can. Well, you say you can. I think that's a bit. It's not that important to have done, I don't think. Well, it depends if you desperately want it. It depends if you think you feel that you're born actually a different sex. Right. And then you went on to say, there's other things that are done. Get this, Steve, someone, if they want. If the cat's got a bad liver. Kidney. All right, bad kidney. Can have it done for five grand. Yeah, you can have it. You can have a kidney operation. But what's wrong with that? If you've got five grand, you want to waste it on a cat, then? Fine, get another one. We went through loads of cats. I've told you before as a kid, we got through loads. It's not worth it. And there's no cat that is that amazing that you go. Gonna miss that one. It's never gonna be the same. What do you mean? What would it have to be able to do to be worth it? It's normally to do with people's affection for their cat. They've had the pet for many years. What do you mean? It should be able to juggle or do impressions. And that's why it's worth my friend. Suppose there was a fella, right, he feels he was born a woman. He's not happy, right? He doesn't want this. He's got a knob and a test, a couple of testicles that he does not want, right? He wants a lovely pair of tits and a minj, right? And he finds out that he gets a cut price. He gets, you know, a cut price sort of operation, a dodgy, backstreet transsexual maker, right? Five grand, knockdown price. Five grand. It's done with a blunt knife and some chloroform. Right? But why have you got it all done? What, you mean just like, have the knob trimmed and wear a bra? Well, yeah. I mean, are you saying if you have it all, then you get some sort of offer if you give them some. No, no, I was being flippant. I'm saying I was trying to get down to five grand. Supposing there was a fellow you had five grand to give away, right? Some old woman with her cat is gonna die, or some fella who wants his knob chopped off and a lovely pair of tits. But on who would you give the five grand to? So, hang on a minute. So there's a fella who wants to. Be a woman, yeah? And there's a woman who's got an ill cat. Yeah. Oh, you see, I'd be annoyed. Whose is this five grand? Is this my savings or. No, just you get given. You get given five grand and you go, but you've got to give it to a charity of a choice. And it's got me one of them. You do what? I'd find out what the cat looks like, get a replacement, right? Say. Should say it's at the op. She's loving it, thinking it's happy again. Yeah. Give the fella the money, right. Do you know what I mean? Well, so you're basically saying that you'd rather have the bloke have his knob cut off and stuff a chat with. Him first and say, what's your problem? And say, why do you need this doing? And I think they go through that. I think they go to counseling and live with a woman for like a. Like a second opinion thing. I just be saying, right. Are you sure? Yeah. But five grand on the cart even, it can only be for people who have got loads of money, right. And it's like, well, five grand, it's nothing. Well, I think this debate arrived on. Should we play a record and come back to this? Think about it. Yeah. Better. White stripes. Placebo. Bitter end on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl, you're looking all flustered and confused again. Still don't get it. What don't you get? Well, that's a long list, Rick. Yeah, the, you know, if you have you knob calf. Yeah. It's because they feel like they're actually born a woman and this, they're not living right. They can't live properly with all the, these things, you know? Well, I mean, there, there are people that are genetically the, the other gender. They've just grown, you know, there was one woman actually was a scientist researching it and found out, you know, she was a man. She had y chromosomes. But this is something different. This is, this is both psychological and everything else, so thing again. And you can't always have, you know, what you want. It's like, I'd like to have air. It's a bit easier. You can wear a wig. You can't go around really well. You can put on, you know, false breasts and tuck it in. That's just it as well, isn't it? You see, you, you say, you know, you could have the operation done and that and yeah, you might sort of feel as free as a woman down below and that. But at the end of the day, you still look like a fella. Yeah. Here's a bra on a split tennis ball to be just like Auntie Nora. Do you know what I mean, though? Well, yeah, but it's about their outward appearance. Well, and how they feel publicly. Don't forget a transsexual. It's not a transvestite. This isn't just a builder in a dress. They have the hormone replacement as well, so they get estrogen. So electrolysis. So they have, you know, they're, they're faceless if. And they, they don't go bald. They're slight, you know, I mean, that it's the, they're the real thing, a transsexual is now the real thing biologically and politically and. But they still be a man won't they? Well it'd be embarrassing if they don't tell their new partner and let's picture them, you know down the pub when they were 24 but you probably sort of get over that don't you? They go just a fellow with a beard drink in the yard of ale. That was me. Well interesting story, probably should have told you this before the honeymoon do you. Know what I mean? It's like you can have all that done right you know you could have your bits done right you can have like false teeth but you know that when you see an old person with a good set of teeth it's like well they're false, there's no way you've got good teeth like that if you were brought up in like the thirties. But what would you do if Suzanne said look I've got a terrible secret and she showed you pictures of this kid, this little boy growing up you know playing football and then the pictures stop at 20 before, just before you met her and she goes and she shows you a nice pair of bollocks in a jar she goes they were mine. Well first thing is he'd take back the gloves you bought her last week. Would you go oh I can't go out with you now or would you say well you're the same person out. There, she is into sport. Should we play a record while you give her a call? No but what I'm saying is it right it doesn't matter what you have done, we can wrap this up here because I've got it sorted right okay. Doesn't matter what you have done, at the end of the day it's obvious that you've had it done. If you're a fella and you've been changed to a woman I could spot you right, if you can't though I tell you what, I was, I was at Susan's mom and dad's right up north last week and I went to the off license yeah and I went in there, never seen this fellow before right, soon as I walk in I eye him up behind the counter, I go alright mate. Oh hello, I notice he's got a wig on right yeah now it was I kind of looked and thought yeah it's a wig, whatever and then I thought I wonder if it is and as I got to the till I said how much is that? He said you know 50 pence so great and as he turned to the. Till, were you buying Susanna gift? As he turned to the till and he did that sort of angle, you got the profile. You see the bit sticking out the back. You go, that's a wig. I know what you mean. I know what you mean. It's like a little. It just. It just. The last inch just lifts away from the net. Yeah, yeah. Everybody who goes in that shop will probably know him. I'm having a wig and that. He keeps him happy, but everybody knows. So what I'm saying is, it's like. But could I just say transsexuals put in a little bit more effort than a fella who's plunked a rug on top and held it down with some duct tape. Do you know? I mean, you know, the only giveaway often with a transsexual is the big hands. They can't do anything about that. That's the only thing, you know. But, but I mean, trans. Transvestites are different. You know that they are bills in the dress. You do. You go in a supermarket, you turn around, you see a six foot woman, huge head, you go, all right, love. You know, I mean, you know, you don't, you know, down below, she's packing more than us three put together. That's what I'm saying. But yeah, I mean, that. That's. What if Eddie Isard, right, meeting Eddie Isard, right, who likes to pop on a dress now and again, right? If. What's the politics with that? Do you go as he walks in, he's all in evening gown, he goes, alright, Carl. And you go, all right, Eddie. And it's in a busy pub. And you go, oh. And you go, do you say, do you want a pint of bitter and slap him on the back? Or do you go, that's lovely, that's a lovely dress. Do you know, I mean, what do you do? What do you do with the transvestite? Would you compliment a transvestite on their. Lovely dress if he was wearing a. Nice dress in the same way that you would if Suzanne was wearing a different way? I probably say that dress, you know, looks nice being even nicer on a woman. So you try and. You try and change the way they think. Yeah, yeah. You'd want to teach him a lesson. Yeah, sure. Yeah. It's just. It's one of things I can't get my head around, to be honest. Right. I can handle airy chinese kids. Yeah. Is it true. Is it true to say that you've never been able to handle a transvestite. So I'm just gonna add that to the list, then, Carl, of things you can't figure out. It's like four volumes. Snoop doggy dog, obviously, in the classic what's my name? XFM 104.9. We've done that. So that's good. We've done. So we've solved the whole transmission issue. Let me just check. We've done hairy chinese kids, people having their knobs cut off on the war as well. We've sort of done that. We've done freaks, haven't we done with no arms and legs. Other areas of. Have we done. Have we done Forrest Gump in a wheelie bin? We touched on your auntie Nora, but I haven't mentioned a five. Five minutes or showing you her. Let me see. I think. I don't know if we've. I think we might have. I definitely like to hear the word plunge more often. Yeah. On this show, Mary. I'm still on the wiser on that, but we'll leave it. I love the fact you are such a sort of. You're such an old man, aren't you? Such a reactionary old man, the way you talk. Are you on sort of bloke. I imagine you and your father stood in a pub. If a man came in and addressed, oi, you're a broken address. Take it off. We did last week. We were talking about things that you can sort of say and do when you're sort of like 40. I thought, another one. Nod to a policeman. Yep, definitely. They're on the beat. They're going along, you're going, your joke, you go, yep. Yeah. I know you're all right. I know you're all right. Yes. Never mind these youngsters shouting at you and knocking your cap off. Exactly. If you're 40, you can nod at copper because it's like going, I know. What you're up to. I respect you now. I didn't when I was younger than I was thinking of. Well done, mate. Well, I like the one you mentioned last week. You're now of an age where a van driver might ask you to back him into a parking space. Yeah. You don't feel good. He wouldn't even consider. Yeah. If you're under 30, you don't. It's like I was thinking if I was in a pub with my dad and say, his mates, and they're all sort of 40 or 50, there is not one of them that would turn to me first with a pint of beer and go, taste that. See if is that off. No, they wouldn't consider me things you can do over, I think, maybe 50. Wear a flat cap and not like a prat. Yeah, yeah. You know, you're wearing it because your head's cold, you're 50 years old, flat cap, fine. Yeah. Or just wear a suit and tie without having to go to an event or a convention. Pop on a little suit. I tell you what, I love seeing old boys in a suit on Sunday. Do you know what I mean? They've got shiny shoes and they're 75. I've got down the pub and I think it's brilliant. I got photographs of one of my late grandfathers. He must have been in his sixties, on the beach, wearing a suit. Wearing a suit on the beach, I think. I got a feeling he's even got a knotted handkerchief and a full three piece suit. That's great. It's brilliant. It's a decent grandfather. In my mind, my grandfather was always wearing a suit. I never saw him. I think he wore a suit to bed. I can't imagine taking that suit off. I just. It was always. Maybe it was no one in one pull on one. But he didn't. I mean, what the weird thing is, though, it wasn't like he worked in a bank all his life. I think he was a builder. And then he retired and thought, it's time I should start wearing a suit. I know. Oh, I love it. I just, you know, I mean, it's because they've got to do something, then they've got to get up and they make an effort and they're, you know, they're still part of the world. As opposed to me already just walking around in my pants. Yeah. I mean, it's like, there's no point in getting dressed. I'm not going out. Yeah. Or everything's got an elasticated waistband. Yeah, yeah. You don't even consider a pair of. Trousers, slip on shoes, pull on trousers. Just. Yeah. I have never seen a man with more Velcro in his closet. That has got to be for you. The best time saving device ever. Velcro. It's great. Just me and a baby girl. A dry white baby. I went to Tuxedo, got Velcro, the award show. I went home. When did we stay there? We went to, what? Twelve or so? Anyway, I went home and I was watching Chatty at the end, right. And I was eating. I had these sesame seeds. I was hungry, I had a few. And in the end of the bottom of this jar of sesame seeds, right? All those tiny little seeds but I didn't want to waste them, so I sort of poured them into a mouth and sort of like ate them like millet, like a budgie binge. I went to bed, got up the next day. Oh, I felt a bit sweaty. I had a resolve. And there was loads of seeds still in my chest. And the hair on your chest? Yeah. It took me ages to pick them out before I had a bath. So they must have stayed there all night. But not with that, you know, with the cheese now cart that was coming through my paws, these seeds. Oh, well, they started growing. I'd have to mow my chest. Oh, dear. Your girlfriend's a lucky, lucky woman. Sesame seed chest. What we got, Karl? Oh, do you remember we were also talking about names? You cannot call kids now. It's like there are certain names. Exactly. There's great old blokes names, but they have to be a baby once. Yeah, but I name this child Alf. You can. There are sort of these names which you just never name a child now. I mean, Carl, frankly, is quite friendly. Oh, but Sid. Alf. Sid. You would never name a child Sid. Stan. Stan. Bert. I named this child Bert. Did I ever tell you about my, my uncle Alf? No, he wasn't, wasn't a proper uncle, right. But it was just one of me, one of my dad's mates. Yeah. And he was getting on a bit. He must have been about, you know, 60, which is pretty old when you're younger and that. And he was the same. He used to always wear a suit and that, but it was never, he was never in good nick. It was always like a rough suit, but it doesn't matter still, you know, making half the effort and that. Yeah. And he used to sleep in a dinghy. What, in his house? Yeah. Why? Well, in a flat, he's in like a little bed set because he only had a little bed set and he was into boats and stuff. So he had these two birds at 1 st, had this little dinghy at a little flat, thought, well, it's tight space. And that he had a dinghy as a bed. And he had two tellies. Two tellies. One of them that the sound worked on the other one. Only the vision worked. So if you wanted to watch a. Program, it's going to turn both on. Put them both on. Like BBC one turned one up and watch the other one. Wow, that's extraordinary. From his dinghy. Sat in his dinghy. That is brilliant. It was an inflatable thing. He was like a wooden. Yeah. Inflatable. Yeah. Did you ever go around and visit him? Yeah, now and again. Was it weird seeing a bloke, a six year old bloke in a suit, in a dinghy inside, watching two tellies? It's weird. Which of the tvs stopped working properly first? I mean, did he. Let's say the sound went on one of them. Yeah. Did he carry on watching the other one, hoping that the other one was fine? No, he went and got a new telly and then the vision went on that anyway. No, it went old on that. Wait a minute, I've got another telly in the wardrobe. That. Using that. It must be like that. Yeah. Wow. He sounds brilliant. Is he still alive? Yeah, he's still around. Yeah. I've seen for years. But he used to. Was he married? I think that's what happened. I think his wife passed away and that's when he had all this. You know, he had a boat. Where. We'Re gonna put it in a bed sit. And it was like, hang on a minute. Yeah. I mean, sleep in that. So, yeah. I wonder if you ever brought any women back. Just the idea of bringing them back, getting down to it. Should we move into the bedroom? Ahoy. Oh, that is fantastic. Missy Elliot, gossip folks on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, carpool. Good. And I know we're not meant to mention the adverts, and I'm not. I'm not slagging off the advert is that. It's that national Lottery advert with a little welsh fellow saying, your money from the national, Laura. He goes towards mountain rescue. Put it out there. We've saved a lot of people now. That's fine. It's great. Well done. What I'm annoyed at is why those people allowed to go up the mountain in the first place. Yeah, don't go there. It's dangerous. You're at your own risk. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Definitely. It's. It's ridiculous. Just posh, Beardy twats climbing mountains and sticking a flag up. I don't want you to. I don't want you to. Am I paying? Is there any point, Rick, where I am paying for people to get rescued from mountains? I'm not sure. I think the lottery is doing it now. Fine, because I'll tell you, if it was my money, I would be living. That's the point, isn't it? I mean, you should take out insurance. If you want to climb up a mountain, you should pay for it. If we save you. It cost a lot of money. You owe you be paying it back for the rest of your life. That's the risk. Not falling to your death. Exactly. But never be able to play. They're all posh and rich anyway. But a cat gets stuck up a tree and the farmer come out because it doesn't know any better. Imagine if that was a bloke. I'm stuck up again. Stop going up there. But that's what I'm saying again though, it's only a cat. So leave it up there. Get another one. And there's the skeleton of tiddles. I couldn't be bothered to go and get a ladder. Nobody's the same. A few weeks ago, everyone was making a fuss over that. That sheep. That was the first clone sheep and it died. Clone another one. Oh, wow. If only you could do the same with mountaineers. Yeah. Oh, it looks the same. The beard's the same. They all look like Brian blessed. Yeah, exactly. Did I ever tell you about the time that my father, when I was younger, we went on holiday, my dad, he bought a little boat, little sort of wooden boat, make a three seater. And he and a friend of his went out with me in the boat. I was maybe twelve or 13, went out. We sort of. We were on the. We had a little motor outboard. Motor chugging out. We just thought. We thought this was real seafaring stuff. We sort of. We'd lost sight of the beach because we'd gone round the corner of like a mountain, like a. What you call like a cliff. And so we're just around the corner and there's this boy, like it's just floating in the water. Not a boy, but you know, like a boy. And. Very tricky to explain that on the radio. It's the same word, isn't it? Boy. A boy and a boy. Yeah. Yeah. And so we float past that and we're just chugging on. The motor conks out. I can't believe it. We have to row back in. They're rowing away. I'm just sat there. And we noticed that every time we sort of think we've got past this buoy, it just seems to be about where it started again. We realized that the tide is taking us to, but not taking us out, taking us towards these rocks. And he was. Got ravaged rocks and we were a bit pretty scared because I can't swim very well. I couldn't at the time. I think my dad had baby bought. You know. He didn't. I'll be honest with you, I inherited a lot of things from him. One of which was his carefulness with money. Just. Just the one life jacket. How deep was the water? Which I seem to remember he tore off my back and put on himself. So the water is pretty darn. You know, I'm not saying we would have necessarily died, but it was pretty scary because the boat, you know, we were going to crash into these rocks and stuff, it was getting pretty unnerving. And so we're there sort of rowing like mad, trying to get. We're not any progress, and we're beginning to think that this might be the end. And this boat, this kind of ferry boat, comes chugging by doing tours, and it comes by and my dad goes, oh, wow. We were going, brilliant, brilliant. They can help us. They'll throw us a rope. They'll tell us, back in, he was going, you've got to be careful, though. Hang on. Because according to the laws of the sea, if he rescues us, Steve, he can claim my boat. The laws of the sea mean he can claim my boat. That's like a reward. What I like is his twelve year old son might die. He's thinking about the boat. I know, but also the other thing, of course, is that I like the idea of this ferry master going, ah, yeah, the boat. Be mine now or take your son. Yeah. Let me think about it. I need a new bed that'll be just right king size. Oh, dear, that's lovely. So, we've done a lot of stuff today. We've covered Minj. We've done. What else we've done. We've done chop your bollocks off for free. Yeah. We've done the. The operations for five grand, which I'm not happy about. Yeah, leave the cat up there, spend money. We've done most stuff. I think we've done a lot. We still haven't done Forrest Gump in a wheelie bin, but we can. We can leave that till next week if you want. See, I still think there's something in the spending money in areas that it's not needed. Like, well, you know, the fella, if you haven't, you know, if you've only just tuned in, you've missed a debate about a fellow who needs his tackle taken off. A debate makes it sound like it was a bit more informed than it actually was. I'm just, you know, all that time, that was probably half an hour ago. I've still been thinking about other things, that it would be good if more money could be plowed into things to get them out there. Like what? I mean, well, I was looking you know, I'm a fan of going on the web and that. Sure. And these inventions, right, we were talking about a few weeks ago, inventions that, that are out there and there's some that, you know, are well known by famous people who have brought stuff out. Do you know why we didn't go on with this? Because I remember saying to you about Einstein, what is cleaves things? Clever. You weren't pressed for it. I said, einstein and you went, this is a quote. You went, Einstein. Well, yeah. Now, I've never needed. You got it wrong. You went, I've never needed MC squared in my life. But the fella who made the video recorder, I watched one a week, right? And it's the fact that everybody's got one good idea in them. Yeah, right. Like Newton said about the, the apple, I did rock busters and there was this thing, there was this thing that was on the website. So they shouldn't be spending money on investigating sort of medical procedures that might help people. They should be spending it on what, Kyle? Well, I found this thing, right, Ricky, brilliant. Yeah. Um, what it was little, sort of mops. Little mops. Like little mop heads. Like floor mops. Yeah. Right. Fit them on your cat feet if. You'Ve got a cat. Right? If you've got a little cat. Yeah. Put, put these little things on, on the feet. And there was a picture of one just like walking around the kitchen, looking. A bit like that. You can't do looking like that on the radio. It's just, just looking a bit sort of fed up. But he didn't really know what was going on. Walking around, you see, like the woman of the house sat in the background on a cup of tea. The cats there walking about on the, on the kitchen, lino mopping the floor. That's what I put my money into. Ah. Can we get shares in this? That's an invention. How good is that? Can we get shares in that? It's good though, in it. I'll tell you what, I market that. Yeah. That's amazing. I just like the idea of people struggling with their cat to get on, though. What if I had a bad kidney? Well, then it's worth paying five grand. I suppose, a year, because it cost a cleaner that, wouldn't it? Yeah. So that's, that's what I'm saying. I mean, there's loads of other things out there that gets load. Of course, you can stick a brush in its head and make it go down the toilet. It'll be genius. Carl. No, but this load you see, you say that if Newton came up with it, you'd be loving it. And loads of them out there and everything, right? Coming up with that. Imagine Newton coming up with that. Carl, think of it. Well, there's other things that gets loads of praise. Penicillin. Everyone who came up with that. Fleming was it? Yeah. So discovered it on there. Right. I'm 30, don't think I've ever used it. But you're a fennel, Benelli. Right. So there's one thing else was talking to you about. Oh, God. You like video. Okay, so video record scope was another thing you. You seem to think is important. Well, no, you asked me about great event. I know someone. So I said, alexander Graham Bell, the telephone, everything from that link, from that. John Loki, Baird television, Marconi, the radio. I said Galileo. I was naming you stuff. It wasn't that, I was just saying that I think those things are more important than rockbusters. I think they're better ideas. Telescope, even telescope. Carl, play a record because there's a website. I must try and find it during this record. It's got loads of inventions. I think you're gonna love it. Vicious from new reeds, always a joy. Yeah. XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkington. Carl, I. Someone pointed me in the direction of this website and I. It basically, I swear to God, these are real inventions, okay? That real inventors have applied for patents for, you know, so they own the copyright. Why don't I come up with one? A real one? Yeah. And then you do Carla Stone on which things the better invention. I think some of these card you are going to be absolutely excited by if you love the little mops that. Go on cats feet, I think to start with. Have you got one there? Ready? Yeah. The x ray machine. All right, so we've got the x ray machine on the one dry machine. Kyle, think of that. So you've come to me. It does. It goes through a paintings. It doesn't need light, it excites it. Can you? Well, we know. You know what an extra. I'm sort of head of some business. I've got a load of money. Yeah, you're coming to me with an idea. Yeah, and Steve's coming with me to an idea. I've got, say, five grand and I've got. I've come. I've come with you. I said, look, I can do transfector operations. I'm not interested. I said, my cat needs a kidney operation. I'm not interested. Right. I've come with you with an x ray. Meanwhile, Steve walks in with. Well, firstly, I'm going to offer you. This is patent 557-1247 you've got the x ray machine. I'm going to come to you with the self containing enclosure for protection from killer bees. Tell me what. All right. Well, it's like self containing enclosure for protection from killer bees. Comprising an enclosure formed of a flexible, transparent plastic material. Basically, that will protect us from any killer bees that might be in the area. Useful. Yeah. Don't decide yet. Okay, I'll come up with another one. Refrigeration. Refrigeration. The combination toy dog and vacuum cleaner. Let me read a bit more. Don't judge yet. A toy dog closely resembling a real dog. And having a hollow interior in which is mounted a vacuum cleaner. Having a suction hose, which is retractable from the tail end of the dog. This enables vacuuming a dog after a haircut and grip grooming without causing fear to the dog, because it thinks another dog. Sorry. This is a decoy dog. To make the dog not realize it's being vacuumed, thinking it's making a friend. There's a picture of it. Carl. Carl, do you see what we're talking about there? That's a dog that looks. Do you see that? Why the cat with the mops is on Steve's side and why twelve x rays, refrigeration. Things that are on my side and Newton's and Mc squared. As you can see the difference in these events, can you see the pattern emerging and the difference? Yeah. But you see, to me, which are you impressed by? Are you impressed by the sanitary appliance for birds? Have a look at it. It's. If you've got domestic bird, maybe budgie gar or something, but you're tired of it crapping everywhere. These are very tiny nappies that go on a. That is real, isn't it, pet? Look, there's a picture. There's a diagram. Can I put the microwave up against that one? I need that. I know. I need the big guns to come out now. What you thinking? I know you. Budgie nappies or the microwave. It's weird because. Carl, are you tired of petting your dog or cat? I bet you are. That's why you need this Peyton Petter. It is an arm on a piece of wood that will go up and down and stroke and pet your dog for you if you've not got time to do it. Well, I can only put up. Interfere on the cancer cure. Exactly. Yeah. You see a lot of these things. These are all genuine inventions. Yeah. And if the time was right, we'd say, get them made. Do you know? I mean, if there was a bad swarm in London, I'd be saying, get the b. Man on. Yeah, yeah. Right. What? Lose. Lose the x ray machines. I don't care about broken bones for now. Well, at that moment in time, that would be more important than. I mean, we know people have been stung. We don't need to look inside them. Sure. Do you know? I mean, it's all about. It's like the telescope now isn't impressive. Sure. If you want to see something in the distance, get on the transport and go and see it. Do you know what I mean? You don't need to look at things in the distance. Right, sure. Guys are shitting and pissing all over people's homes. Could we put these. I tell you what, Carl. So it's looking at supernova and trying to find out more about the universe. It's its conception and its eventual end. Forget that, Rick, because I've got the cheese filtered cigarette. Now. Tell me more. This is a cigarette where the filter is actually made from cheese. Apparently, cheese acts as a very good filter for tobacco. So the smoke passes through the cheese. Thus you will induce a kind of smoky cheese. And also smoking, you know, might make you a little bit peckish. And you can just nibble that. So there's no dog end lying around. Pavement or budgie. Shit. It's a cleaner place and you haven't been stung. Brilliant. Right. Now, listen. So that's that done. Yeah, we've done that as well. Yeah. We're running out of time. We've got, like, five minutes left. Winner, four songs of phrase. All right, give us the answers. Right, this. We did this at the start. We haven't got time for the film thing today, but we'll do that next week. Songs. A phrase. It was a phrase. You never see an old money in a Twix. I love the fact that we go, we haven't got time. Like it's. We've had such important stuff and it's been so jam packed and interesting. Not that it's been drivel with gaps we could have filled much better. Yeah, don't look at it like that. Like what? With his film quiz. Come on. Oh, dear. Song's a phrase. You never see an old man eating a twix. We had to change it to Narsbar. Here's what we had. Jerry and the pacemakers echoing. The bunny man. David Bowie. And the Beach Boys. Finished oh, what do you mean? I brought that one. What do you mean? Who's the winner? Oh, it doesn't matter. Do you got to give the answer? It was that one. You didn't know it was us. It was Jim. Jim Crow shaves it. Old river. Jim Crochet. Old man river. Yeah, Jim Crow. Shay sang old Man River. I don't think so. What was it? Who cares? Well, people. I can't believe this. You are old Man river. It was. Let's. Let's give the prize to crochet. Wouldn't have sung old Man river. Let's give the Paul Robeson. Let's give the prize to Mitchell Sterling, who has got some of the answers. Right on XFM 104.9. I will be playing that great quiz. Again next week, Mick and Gervais with it on XFM Sports. And if you want to send an email or check out the website on XFMs, all the comms. Good night. Coming up is now oblivion and stoopy nouns. Excellent.",
