Canfield level. God, it got pre out. Look at him giggling. Look at him. Look at him laughing. That's so funny because I got a letter here from. Who? Is it from Mike Hill, who sent me a little picture of a little japanese fella from a film who said, looks like me. And he does a little bit, but he says, please, can you make Carl laugh? I've never heard him utter as much as a snigger. And I'm worried he may have a genetic disorder. Well, I mean, he has got a genetic disorder, obviously, but he was giggling then. I hope people heard you then. Look at his little face. It was a joy. I love the things that make him. Happy, but I love. Just before the microphone came up, just before the record finished, he had his headphones on. The music was too loud and he was just shouting, Bauhaus is not working. It's not working. I have to play something else. I went and found Ziggy Stardust by Bauhaus. Listen. Why isn't it working? Look at him giggling. Look, he's lost it. Is he going away? Is he on drugs? Carl, what have you done? He's tickled. Look at his little one. He looks like one of those shaved monkeys. Look at his little width. Oh, my God. I've never seen a forehead glow. I know, it's extraordinary. And he's got that red shirt on as well, so the whole of him is just a big glowing. Carl, what are you trying. What you putting in? I'm just. I'm gonna see if I can get this to work. Go on, then. Hang on. Brilliant. Radio Doctor Fox. I hope Doctor Fox is listening because I think he's eating his words right now. Steve. Right, I think I've done it. Well done. That's excellent. Right, let's play Bauhaus now and let's try and compose ourselves. This is Iggy Stardust by Bauhaus. It worked. That worked. Didn't it say panic over? Calm, calm now, calm now. You are oldly soon, aren't you? Yeah, he's got. You gotta go off early. Well, about. About. How many hours have you had? Because I only ever have time off when I'm working, like doing another job, like, you know, filming or something. But you seem to have a lot of holidays, just like. And you're sick as well. You just like, because you had wet trousers, which is a little bit do. You don't care about the job. I mean, I've got to ask because, you know, I mean, if I was in charge, I'd worry about your motivation or because we. Yesterday we were trying to work out what you enjoyed doing and we got to Manchester United and moaning and that is. That is the two we came up. I don't know where you get the moaning thing. You're always whinging about. What? Everything. What? When did I last have a moan? Just before we came on air. Right. And why was that? I don't know. I can't remember which. We were in good mood. We were in a good mood being Rick. I'll tell you why. Go on. Because you brought a song in at ten to one. Yeah. With a load of effing and Jeff in it. Yeah. Saying, can you edit this? Yeah. But that's your job. You could have brought it in yesterday. No, I couldn't. Why not? I hadn't thought of it. But why? Why are you whinging? That's your job. And I didn't come in ten minutes before. It was a good 20 minutes before. It just took you ages because you were whinging and moaning to even get started. I'm not being dragged into this. You are always. I'm on the holiday now. Well, not yet. No, you're not on yet. You're still working. Well, that's what's funny. This isn't even work. Right. And yet it should be, compared to what I do in the week. This is a doddle. Well, it's because you're not putting any effort in, clearly. Where are you going, anyway? Where are you heading? Carmo? Yes. What's happening down there? Uh, well, there's a monkey world. You're excited about that? We don't see that. Probably go twice to that. Yeah. Whilst I'm down there. How long you waited for the whole week. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, this is with your parents, isn't it? Yeah. Tucking them out. Tucking them out. What do you think your father be up to? What's he gonna be nicking on this holiday? Tin. There's a lot of tin in Cornwall. They've shut the mines. He's, uh. He's just called Suzanne, said they've got there, so it's a nice little place. There'll be no towels when you get there. So what do you do? What are you going to do? Just going to chill out and sort of like, go to the pub and stuff? Yeah. Like I say, I mean, all I've got planned is probably the. Probably Tuesday and Thursday at Monkey World. What about Wednesday? What do you think of Wednesday? Just wandering around. Just sort of think about, you know. King Arthur and that. He was down there, wasn't he? I don't know, but where you going? What town? I don't know. I don't know where. The phone to her saying, we'll pack them. Pack two pairs. Poor woman. She's packing your bags for you. Right. You spend more time home. If Steve didn't come in at ten two with a rap record with, like, obscenities all over it. Yeah, well, we'll play that next week. Well, you didn't even get the job done. That's the thing, we can't even play it because you didn't get finishing time. I tell you what, that method man, if he doesn't stop effing and jeffing, it's the end of his career, in my opinion. All this f that and. Yo, Jeff. I'm a Jeff myself. I'm hanging out with my Jeff. It's terrible Jeff. And we know you can't put out the j word on. On xfm. Oh, mother. Jeffer. So we haven't got that, but what we have got. Go on. Monkey news. It's still got monkey news. Have we? That's sorted out. That's coming up. Yeah. Rockbusters. Yeah. Well, last chance. Definitely your last chance. This time. You actually improved a little bit last week. You did a couple of good ones. So again this week and cheeky freak. The controversial cheeky freak of the week, where Carl finds a human being with some sort of congenital or, you know, imposed deformity or, you know, so. And we talk about that in a wry way. Do you think that. Do you think that's big and clever? No, but that's. That's just it, it's never about taking the Mickey out of someone, right? It's about. It's to make you think. I'll tell you what isn't big and clever, how lucky you are. A dwarf with learning difficulties. Nice. Yeah, yeah. We'll explain it to you. That's the forthcoming single from british sea power. That's called carrion. That's nice and retro. That's like end of the seventies Bowie, that's great. On XFM 104.9. That's just some of the records that. We'Ve played so far, you know, I. Mean, you've had the darkness, you've had Bauhaus. It's like, can it get any better? Card? You think, like I say, we've got. Monkey news coming up. Guess what? I lost 400 quid cash this week. Gambling? No, no, no, this, that's tragic. This is why it gutted me. It wasn't even your gambling. No, I had, uh, I'd photo shoot, I had the suit and I'd claim back some expenses and I had it in my pocket. And then when I took the suit home, it must have fallen out in the street or the cab. And I remembered it and I went to, I went every pocket twice. And it was just that I don't think about. Oh God, that's terrible. That's a terrible blow. I think. Oh God. If I had it back now, it would be free money. If I suddenly found it now, I'd have 400 pounds. That was just free money. And I had a little nap to get over it and I was. And you were fine. I was okay. But that's got someone just found what? A gift that is just, I mean, untreated. Was it in a money clip? Was it wrong? In a money clip? No, it was just literally 400 quid in an envelope. I know. See, I'd always hand it in. I genuinely would. Unless I found it in a. In the middle of a forest or something. It was in the street, do you know what I mean? Because a bear dropped it. Yeah, yeah, but I mean, if I found it in a pub or a cab, I just handled through. Exactly. Yeah, but would. I'd hand it in, but there's no way. If they found it in the street, there's no way they could do it. You know, it goes police station and it sits there for six months, but. Yeah, exactly. Well, it's not a waste of time, pocket it. But I. Because when I was younger, I remember being outside a post office once and I was about ten or twelve and finding a purse and thinking, oh, that's nice. And I opened it up and there was some money in there and a pension book and so it was obviously an old lady. I found an address, I sent it to her and my mum said, you know, you've been so good there, you'll probably get a little reward. She'll be sending you a little reward. Nothing. I got maybe a thank you note, but no cash, no Mulan, nothing. Really. I was livid because I've been told that I was going to get a reward. I thought, I've been a good samaritan, nothing. So many moons later, when I was at university, I learned from that. This is the most bizarre thing. This explains a lot, doesn't it, Carl? This is like the Mary Celeste. I went to a cash pointer. I thought, I can't get my card in here. And I realized there was already somebody's card in the machine. They put the code in, but then they just disappeared. They'd been kidnapped or something. So it was just there waiting, sitting, said, what do you want to do? And it gave you a number of options. I thought, interesting. Steal or go to heaven. Oh, dear. Well, I pressed balance just to check what their bank balance was. Unbelievable. It was a considerable sum of money. I'm not going to lie to you, it was not typical student debt. It was like, I think they were a foreign student. There was a lot of cash in there, a lot of money. Did you feel a slight bulge in your trousers when you saw the amount of money? I couldn't believe my life. I thought to myself, now then, I could just take that card out and hand it in, or I could teach them a small lesson, right? And maybe give myself a reward, because last time I did that, I didn't get reward. So if I give myself 30 pounds, then I'll take the card out. 30. Give myself 30. You didn't really. Well, I thought, that's a good reward. And I. And I went in, I handed the card in, I took that, Steve, and that's a little reward for me. And I'll tell you this, don't think it's evil, because I went and I bought everyone a drink. Well, brilliant. Yeah. I didn't tell him I got the money for them. Excellent. So probably gangsters are quite generous with the money they stole from other people. Yes, but someone's negligence, Rick has lent. The thing is this. I believe it. Except they're buying people a drink, car. What do you think? Well, I kind of thought that when he said it, but then I thought, but they'll be buying one him back. So he's still. So, in a way, he's still a winner. Yeah, everyone's a winner in that situation, including the student, because frankly, if there had been a less scrupulous person who found it, they'd have probably helped themselves to consider. I cannot believe he did that. There was thousands of pounds in there. What if it was? What if Beadle had jumped out and slapped you with his little claw and said, we've been filming this merchant. Well, what? So what? How old were you then? I don't know, 1920? Would you do it again? Or was it just to get the world back for the old lady's purse? Um, possibly do it again, yes. You're joking. Well, you've got to think of it this way. You've got to think of it as, there was a lot of money in there, and someone less scrupulous than me would have taken a fortune. They'd clean them out. Whereas I just took a small reward, which I thought was more than enough for someone's negligence. And I've returned the car. They've got the car back. Everything's fine. Think of someone else. I could have gone on a spending spree. I could be buying stuff, all sorts. Yeah, but it wasn't yours at all. Yes, they probably would have given me a reward and because, you know, sometimes people forget or, you know, they don't give you a reward. I thought I should go at your dad from nicking a loaf of bread out of a phone box. Yeah, but that's because it's for old people, geriatrics and stuff. How do you know? How old was your people you were robbing from? It's a student on a student campus. Wow. I think it was more. I thought it was excellent behavior. That's showing another side to him, isn't it? What would you have done, Carl, in that situation? And tell the truth, I might have helped myself a little bit. There you are. This is helping yourself a bit. Like you say, just sort of, you know, send it back and sort of say, you know, if you find a. Pound coin in the street and you can be bothered to bend over for it, then have it. But someone's cash, point card or personal belongings, I'd let them know, though. Did you send it to them and say, I've, you know, service charge included? I've sort of took that out already? No, I gave. I handed it into the. No. What do you mean, you'd let them know? I'd say, you know, you're lucky here. Right. I just took. I'd probably take 20, actually, because that's just, like, one. No, sorry. Sorry. Right, okay. You are winding me up. No, no, I'm not. I mean, not for once. I mean, I know what Steve's like. He is tight. Right. No, he is. And you know that, don't you see? Well, no, I mean, just the way you are. You very sort of, you know, you. You're not wasteful with your money. I'm careful. No, I'm not wasteful. Absolutely right. No, no, but to the extreme. Not towards extreme. Not towards the extreme. No, no. Look after the pennies. The paint will take care of themselves. All right. Simple to remember. Good advice. All right. The thing is, right. I know that I took the Mickey out of you for like, you know, the way you look and stuff. Sure. Well, I'm right back at you. But the thing is, you can't help that. Absolutely. But I'll tell you something that women don't like. Sure. And it's fellas who are tight with the money. Sure. I'm not. I'm not frugal with money with ladies. I'm frugal money with you. Well, I have no reason to splash money out on you. I've never seen you splash money out. Well, you've never been out with me. Have you ever, Steve? Have you ever splashed out on a lady? Um, no, but I hope to one day. The right lady. Blair, out of time on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Talking of money, Steve, look at this, right, it's in the paper. A wife has had her beauty insured for a hundred thousand pound in case she grows ugly and her husband walks out. Nicole Jones, 26, of Chipping Sodbury, Gloucestershire, says 200 pounds a year swipe pays 200 pounds a year for a policy. She arranged it as a present for her husband, Richard. Her beauty will be judged by a panel of builders. So have they been selected beforehand, do you think? Do they know who they are? I assume they're complete strangers. So supposedly, like, in 30 years time, he looks at her and goes, well, you've lost your looks. She goes, well, have I? Yeah, well, yeah, well, have I? Calling the panel. Somebody was going, yeah, all right, get them out for that. Well, never mind that. Yeah, she's lost it. Right? 100 grand. 100 grand. I mean, your way. They stand on some scaffolding. Yes. She walks by. Yeah. And if they will whistle, that is amazing. Do you think they give her a quote first? Yeah. What if they say, actually, love, you got nothing to lose. You're not an oil paint in any way. We can't come round and judge your beauty for at least. I mean, that is just open to abuse, isn't it? 100,000 pounds. Because I remember in Japan, they're mad on golf, and if you get a hole in one, you buy everyone, you throw a party, and it was costing them like thousands and thousands of pounds. So they were insuring themselves against getting a hole in one. And so miraculously, everyone was going, I got hole in one. Did he? Yep. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they could be in that together, couldn't they? I'm sure they're not. They're probably more honest than you two. That would take 20 quid out of a cash point. But, you know, 30. I like the wording, though. A wife. Our wife. The word wife. The word wife. It's a. I don't know why. I just find this is an odd word. This is. Hello, this is my wife. Hello. Uh, the wife. Yeah, the wife. My wife. It seems a word that you have to say if you're 60. You. Yeah, I know. Have you met the wife? And even then, ironically, unless someone you don't know. Exactly. Are you married? Yeah, my wife is from, you know. Yeah, that makes sense. But it's still good. Oh, better get back. I'm eating the wife for dinner. Especially when you know them. Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember bumming into someone. Friends, wine somewhere at a party. A couple that I knew, and I'd known both of them before they got married. In fact, I know her, I think, longer. And he said. I said, where? So and so. And he went, oh, the wife will be along in a minute. And it's just this notion that use her name. I know she is. I know her name. It's like someone going, you know I'm married. You know. You know I'm married. In the eyes of God, we are wed. Yes. That makes me more of an adult. Ownership. Yeah. It's like going, you know, I'm a real man, I've got a wife. And here she is. My wife. I find it. There's two words I find hard to say in a shop. I could never ask for wet ones. Do you know? I mean, if I. If I have to go and ask for wet ones, I won't bother. Or toilet duck. Another one. I probably. I never say Snickers. Why? Dunno. I think as I grew up with marathon. Yeah, see, I still. This is so pathetic. I still get embarrassed buying toilet paper. Really. We know if you go into like a 24 hours shop just around the corner. Not supermarket, big shop, but if you just go in there and you're just maybe buying some milk, a chocolate bar. Cause it's like they know what you're up to. No, no, but they know you're gonna. Use it to, you know, when you go into the laboratory at some point it's sort of. It's too intimate. But you just go, I know what you're thinking. I'll be using this after masturbation. Thus saving all embarrassment. It goes with the porn magic Elvis Costello. Allison from way back on. XFM 104.9. A retro cupped. Indeed. Well, up to the modern day, the newest game show around rockbusters. Wee isn't there a jingle? It'd probably be something like, oh, rockbusters. It would be very long. I've got to work it out. But, I mean, yeah, let's go without it for now. And they'll be on ready next week. Excellent prizes once again, sourced by Carl Pilkington. I think it's been in the prize bag before, Carl, but I could see it back. The best air guitar album in the world, ever. Do they keep sending it back? It comes with a window tied to a brick, actually. There's a lot of good stuff on there. There's the kink. Not Fla, is there? Not Fla. Not Fla, I believe is on T Rex. Anywhere to be seen. Definitely clapped, I would have thought a deep purple. We got qo, Skynyrd, Mack, snake. Is there straights? Excellent. And, yeah, there's all sorts on there, obviously. Yeah. This is always an odd choice, but fair enough. This is the current album by the Yardbirds, their first studio album in 35 years. So the new music stage in XFM, giving away that. It's new music in some ways. Smash hits compilation. We got stuff on there. It's. Aha. It's curious to hear the cats. All the old favorites. Plus two DVD's. Columbo. What? Colombo. It's got a couple of classic Columbo episodes there. Suitable for framing. One of the best tv programs of all time. Why do I get. You can always tell immediately who the villains are. Suitable for framing. I'm assuming that's some kind of art dealer, artist, candidate for crime, presumably some kind of presidential or political candidate. Yeah, no, that'd be good, I'm sure. Columbo. I mean, stab woman. That was my favorite episode. Stab lady wife. I mean, to be fair, I'm not sure why. Who would buy a Columbo DVD? Like, you can't find it on tv now. It's on now. I guarantee someone could maybe email in. Is there an episode of Columbo on now? Anywhere they've got cable or digital? I think it will certainly. But it is great. And the other DVD here is Cruise of the gods, which was the. The one off tv kind of film, comedy film that was on at Christmas featuring Rob Ryden's Coogan. Yeah, there's a few gifts there. Not. Not bad. Not bad. Right, now we get to the real deal, okay? That's what everyone tunes in for. This is monkey news, I think. Not the music. Go on. Well, here we go then. Three cryptic clues. Wow. Easy as that. Email in. It's. Yeah, email in. Right. What's the email address? Ricky doctor Vase fm dot co dot uk. Well, don't say I know it or care nothing. So the first one, he's got american coins all down his spine. Right? He's got american coins all down his spine. What bands that? What artist is it? Email in. What does he begin with? What? N. I know it. I've got it already. Right. That's rubbish. Too easy. Yeah. Second one, Jeremy Beadle has got arthritis. Right? Jeremy Beadle has got arthritis. Yeah. That's the second clue. The initials there. SLF. Right, slF. Jeremy Beadle's got a little bit of arthritis. And a third one, foxy shipman and a country western singer on a merry go round. SD. Right, so foxy Shipman and some country western singer having a go on a merry go round. The initial SD. Right, so email in. Ricky doctor. Very genuinely intrigued with that one. I like the fact there's a certain whiff of controversy about it because Shipman is mentioned. Little bit edgy there. So that's. That's the three. He's from your neck of the woods. Any as well, Shipman? Yeah, yeah, I think my mum's mum used to use him. Okay, let's play a record. Well, gotta play a record or play some adverts. Do you fancy some answers? Oh, I'd rather adverts. Yeah. So I've got some for you. Excellent placebo, this picture on XFM 104.9. Steve. Yes. I think Carl's gonna put most people to shame. We were talking about generosity earlier. Carl is a nice, generous bloke when. When it really comes to it, he's paying for Father's Day, he's paying for the cottage, that he's going away with his dad. Are you really co. Yeah. Right, well, there's no way of us proving if that's true or not. What do you mean? Well, you could be like, but why. Would I do that? Well, because you want to show off. I didn't do it on air. You mentioned it. I don't want people to know. Generous I am. Just do it. Just get on with it. I mean, yeah, like charity work in that. Yeah, exactly. But I thought that you wouldn't have fallen for Father's Day. I'd have thought you'd have known it was like. We don't. I mean, to be honest, there's a bit of a coincidence because I pay for it anyway and it's happened to fall on Father's Day. Right. Don't fall for it. I mean, obviously that and Mother's Day and a plethora of other things were, I mean, literally invented by card companies to make more money. I know. Yeah, that's, that's, that's. I mean, my dad always says don't. Don't get him a card or anything because he ate so it. With all these things, I'd like, you know, ripoff times, really. Just ripping people off. Yeah. Stingy. Well, no, no. I mean, he's right. Yeah, he's right. It's just because fellas aren't bothered about getting cards anyway, are they? But the other thing that he noticed, um, you know, helping out the flower companies, the princess Diana thing, when she. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Jesus Christ. So when? Yeah. What do you mean? What do you mean? That's. That's what he said. He said. I nearly swore then, because I was. You surprised me all the time. No matter. That is incredible. Sorry, what? I don't understand. What you told the flowers that were sort of sold that day, right? What? People to leave as a commemoration. Yeah. They made a, made a. Men, didn't they? Who did? Flower companies. Right. So what you're saying, you know, makes you wonder. Well, whether. About what? Whether it was in the floor or behind the hit. Oh, so it's a conspiracy. It's a conspiracy by the flower. I would love to see you and your dad just sitting at home watching a bit of channel five when apes go mental. Right. With your, with your rose. When's that one? And they do that. Well, yeah, you know. You know kill Diana, don't ya? Flower company, son. Right. Quite right. Dad. You're not wrong. What are you talking about? No, I'm not. You know, I'm just saying it's. It's like you were saying about the cards, you know, I'm flying. Too much of a. Too much of a coincidence. I'd be interested to see sort of, you know, like the business graph. Sure. Now, the companies were doing then suddenly. Yeah, but then, but then, by the same token, Elton John, you know, he started the biggest selling hit record in the. Off the back of that. I mean. So is he incriminated as well? If you want. I mean, it's a conspiracy theory. You've not kind of analyzed terribly closely. You've put it out there. And if people maybe were investigating, want to kind of add that into their inquiries, then they can. Yeah, sure. But that's all I'm saying. I'm just, you know, because it's always the same thing in it. Like, I was out shopping the other day, you know, treating Susan like I do. I like spending money in that. I was in wh. Smith's. Yeah. Oh, classic. What was it? Was it a big birthday? Was it. Was it a 30th? No, I was getting a. Was it two biros for the price of one? I was getting. I was getting a card for my dad for Father's day anyway, because I'm seeing him. Yeah. Uh, big Toblerone. Yeah. There was a. Who is it? Who said Father's day? They love it. Love a toblerone. I've never understood Toberm because the only time I see Toblem is in airports. Right, and mini bars. That is what the small toblerone is for. The minibar in a hotel, three star upwards. And the big toblerone. Well, it's. The big toblerone is a gift, isn't it? It can only be a gift. You wouldn't buy the Toblerone for yourself. Yeah, duty free gift. The Tobleone, it's next to, you know, chanel number five, Toble and a bear. Specifically, would you be buying that toblerone. For, I don't know, someone who's clearly. Never had it before and would think it was interesting novelty. Yeah. Well, this gifts. Interesting. I'll tell you what, though, Toblerone is brilliant. I mean, if. Whoever makes that, if they want to send sort of, you know, some toblerone, I mean, I will eat toblerone. Yeah. I think very much the same about. I think very much the same about. Fags and, of course, cigarettes. If you've got any boxes of cigarettes. And you don't want, you know, duty. Free or whatever, send them. I'd just like to say that in no way do I endorse Carl's dad's theory that flower companies behind the death of Diana. No, maybe I could say that on there as well, just to save any complaints. I'll tell you what, though, talking about fag packets and that, do you know, like, now they've got. They've got. If you have these, they'll do you in, sort of thing on the front. Now they've got these special stickers on them. Yeah. Saw a thing in a magazine the other day, Brazil. It's got, like, pictures of ill people on. Blimey, that is gone really hardcore over there. That's good, isn't it? But, I mean, to be fair, what more can they do? I mean, there are five packets now that say these will kill you and people are still smoking them. I mean, I don't know what they. I don't think. I don't think the message you could. Ban them all together, I suppose, if they. It seems weird to sort of sell guns and go, careful. You can kill people with these. Well, bannermen. I'll just be careful. Let's have a look. This is poison. This is poison. These are really, really mental poison drugs. You know, those people with the. You ever see them in the street? Uh, they're selling fags duty free, obviously. They're just selling on the street. You just. Have you ever seen these guys? Yeah, I walk over there, Finchley Roadlock, because I'm just near my place and, uh, all these people, they're just. And they're sort of looking a bit shifty. And then they just. They think that you're maybe a smoker. They just. Oh, yeah, thanks. And I like from their jacket. And it literally will be like something from, you know, the 1940s. They won't go to you, though, do they? They know you must have never had a fag in your life. But, you know, I might be buying them as a gift or something because I'm quite a generous guy. But it struck me, I was chatting with my friend about, you know, there seems to be. There are certain people who are very. Maybe they have trouble getting work, or maybe they, you know, they're immigrants who've not landed on their feet and they've had trouble, you know, and so there's a couple of jobs they can do, it seems, when there's the flag selling. There's those people I notice on Oxford street who bend a piece of wire into the shape of your name. I. What kind of a gift is that, really? I know. They're literally giving them out. Or you can deep. Well, you can have the bending, the name. You can be selling those things that you throw at the wall make they sliver down Dover. Yeah. What are you doing? I'm a trained carpenter. Right. Can you write really small on a piece of rice? I could write those names on a piece of rice. I could try. Quite tricky. But what about the rest of your family? Well, that one's only two, but he could be trained. He's got smaller fingers. Okay. Do you want to sell some knocked off perfume? Look at that again. We'd like to apologize for any inadvertent racism suggestion that Lady Diana was killed by flower companies or that Steve makes a habit of stealing from cash points. What about XFM 104.9? A picture of Rick Waller on the front of the bargain bucket. Red hot chili peppers. Universally speaking on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant. And, of course, Carl Pilkington. Now, people come up to me and I say, is Carl for real? And I go, what do you mean? He goes, well, they want to say, is he that stupid? And the answer is yes. Right. Some people think that he's putting it on. Some people think that he's a character that we've invented. Like, we've got an actor in. Like, he's a Gareth Keenan or a Tim or something. And I go, that we've scripted exactly. Yeah. No, it's absolutely real. Aren't you Kyle? I go, where did he come from? Well, just to tell the story. We came here, and I was much too important to run the desk myself this time round, so they just gave. Us a T. Boy. Steve came in with you. I remember that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Why do you remember that? Oh, Steve knows. I don't want to keep going over it, but it's just the way he looks. Were you taken aback? A little bit, yeah. So, right. And he's just developed into my favorite thing. I always say that you get bored with, like, you know, battling tops or, you know, pet sometimes. I mean, I love. I love my cat. But he's not as, you know, actually. Kyle's away next week. Is he available to run the day? No. Well, he's not as. Actually, not as intelligent as Carl, and that's the truth. He's not, you know, not marginally. Yeah. But I know in the week, he's like one of his little tamagotchi toys, Carl, because I have to phone him every day and keep his interest up. Yeah. An interesting fact. And I got a book out, and I found out our cool car about that, and I thought this was a great fact, right? A two day old gazelle can run faster than a racehorse, right? I thought that was incredible. True. Okay. So I phoned him. I said, a two day old gazelle can run faster than the racehorse. He went, what does it do after that? I went, what? He said, well, how fast does it run when it's adult? I went, well, even faster. He went, oh, I thought we could just do it then. But then it sort of lost it. I went, what are you talking about? I went, you know, that's incredible. A two day Alcazar? He went, well, no, that's what they do. I went, what? He went, that's what they do, isn't it? I went, what do you mean? It's two days old, right? He went, yeah, but a one day old fly can fly. I'm 30 and I can't fly. It's not what I do, right? And I went, right? He went, a jellyfish can hold its breath underwater for hours. I went, it doesn't hold its breath, does it? It hasn't got lungs. So he went, what? And now I had him. What do you mean? I said, well, they don't breathe, do they? What do they do? I went, well, they get oxygen directly from the water via osmosis, straight into their cells. And it just went quiet. And I went, a two day old gazelle? And he went, yeah. Do you know, I mean, I was. Just thinking about the jellyfish. Yeah. He was looking up osmosis and then he was thinking about the jellyfish. But I just think, I mean, if Bambi is anything to go by, this little gazelle spends a whole day trying to stand, and the next day enters the derby, and you don't. You don't think that's incredible? Yeah. So, yeah, you know the sort of things I find incredible. Gone. Mirrors. Kettles. Yeah. Oh, God. Well, listen, remember the time when I tell you about the baby that had a baby? Baby that had a baby. The baby that had a baby, yeah. It's happened again. No, it hasn't. Well, it didn't happen the first time. It was in the papers, I think on a Monday, in all the tabloids. So it's a twin, where one is. Has grown and the other one is still at a fetal level. No, it wasn't, though. It had grown. He was saying to his mom, who. Was saying to his mom, the little. Kid who was seven years old, and he saying, yeah. And he was pregnant, yeah. What do you mean? And he was saying to his mama, God, I don't feel well. And, like, his belly was all swollen and they thought he'd just been eating cake or whatever, and he was saying, I can feel something moving about. And they were like, stop messing about. There's not wrong with you. Eventually, I think he was in gym, at school. In gym. What? Jim was pregnant with him. Oh, no, he's not a russian doll. He was at school, right? Just about to do sit ups or whatever they do at school. Flew out across the room. Teacher goes, you're a bit fat. You look a bit pregnant. And so, best the doctors took him, said, you're seven years pregnant. Or something like that. You're seven years pregnant, or something like that. You see the doctor go, why don't you think about what you say before you say it? See? See the reaction again? Now the gazelle. I didn't get excited like that. Seven years pregnant. Send it in. If someone's online at the moment just having a look around, it'll be on. It'll be. It happened on Monday or Tuesday because I told you at the pub quiz and I. Steve, I said, I know the babies had a baby. Yeah. And you were like, yeah, whatever. Well, I just thought you were talking nonsense. Is every. Well, we'll find out. You're seven years pregnant. Yeah. You're a full player record. Well, we still got stuff coming up. Monkey news, rock busters, answers. We'll have to get that out the way soon because we got a cheeky. Freak of the week. Yeah. Brilliant America by Simon Agar Funkel on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais and I understand I'm about to read my word, Steve. Well, once again, there's always someone and it looks like it's Mike Lamb who has come to Lambos. Let me down then. Doctors have removed a four pound baby boy from the stomach of his seven year old twin brother. Alan Jane was born with the freak fetus growing inside him. For seven years it lived like a parasite until a school doctor became alarmed about Alimon Jan's bulging tummy and took him to hospital. Surgeons who gave him a scan, operated immediately, unaware that the baby was attached to the boy's blood vessels and still alive. They saved alarm jam from certain death, but knew the eight inch fetus was doomed. So there we are. Boy pregnant with his own twin brother by Barbara Davis. That was in the mirror, apparently. So I've read on and all the facts are right. They took him to school. The parents didn't realize. And that isn't even this week's freak of the week. I mean, you've got a free, you've got that. You can have that. That's the free freak of the week. You know, that's giveaway. That's like 13 and a half percent extra. Yeah. You know, I mean, that you might get with hairspray or something. So that, I mean, if that's. If that's just the throwaway. Freak of the week there to freak of the weeks there, if that's their face to figure. I can't wait to see what the actual freak of the week is that people are paying for is incredible. Carl, I tell you what, something else you can have for free. Go on. Another sort of freaky thing, right? I was watching this, this program in the week. What? I don't know what it was, but it was about. I just saw this little fella on it, right? Would you little fella he was doing this history thing. Oh, right. Yeah. I know what you mean. I know is this, that he's found out that a viking was a bit like him. Yeah. So, yeah, he was boneless or something. Always. That's the way thing. What do you think of that, Steve? He's what? He's boneless. No, he was called Harry the bone is somewhere. You know you're gonna get there, don't you? That's what I mean. Always have a. Have a name. Elephant man. You know, Harry the Boneless. Where is he? You know, I mean. I mean, I'm meeting someone. Waiter, um, what's his name? He's called Harry the Boneless. He's over there flapping around. Yeah, yeah. He's over there in the bucket having noodles. That's what I mean. But do you reckon you could do that? Do you reckon you could harvey bones taken out. I love talking to him. He's brilliant. It's like 25 year old. I was asking Suzanne when she was watching it and she ask me later, yeah, brilliant. She wanted to know about what did. You said you were watching this program about history, right? About vikings. You turned. Your girlfriend said you reckon you could have your bones taken out. I love that. I mean, that's what. That is why you are my favorite. What do you mean? Do you think you can have your bones taken out? Firstly, why would you have your bones taken out if you've only got a. Small flat or something and there isn't much room? Yeah, right. And what I mean is, would all your organs still do the stuff? No, they wouldn't. You just be mush. Listen, I'll tell. I'll teach you something now, right, the skeleton. Right. Spam. Yeah. Support, movement. Anchorage. No. Support protection. Anchorage, movement. Spam. That's what. That's what the bones do. Yeah. You couldn't stand up. You would be protected. Because they protect his ribcage, skull, of course. Anchorage. Everything holds onto it. Every muscle is tethered to pull against something like a crane, a pulley system. So you wouldn't be able to move at all. Do you know what I mean? So you just. You'd be in a bucket. There'd be nothing. Well, you die immediately, obviously. No, you can't have your bones taken out, Carl. I mean, why do you need to ask that question? Sorry, but boneless Bob or whatever his name was. Harry. Harry. Harry the Boneless. He presumably didn't have any bones. I mean, that's why he had that name. No, he did. No, he's not the name. Yeah. Exactly. No, he was just. I've had an email here from Graham, old Ken Rowan. He just says, I had a dream about Carl last night. I had a dream about Carl last night. Can I sue? I have no idea what he looks like, apart from the boldness. And yet he turns up in the middle of my dream. I don't need this. It's harassment. But people having dreams about you now, Carl, you actually. It's like you're one of the something that was created by the brothers Grimm. I've got. I had a dream. You know, when used, people used to have anxiety dreams. They had an exam or something, like you suddenly go to school and you realized, oh, my God, you didn't have your trousers on or. I had anxiety dream, I assume. We started off anxiety about the office, about filming the office, and we had to. We had to film in HMV, but someone hadn't cleared it, and so we had to find an r price and I went, okay, that do. And as I was walking there, right? I didn't have any shoes on, which is like an anxiety dream, but I looked down and I went, so what? Yeah, so I'm so lazy now. I think even anxiety dreams don't kick into me. I'm not sure that's true. I think that's just a memory. I would be at all surprised if. You turned out filming the office with no shoes. We don't need shoes. But we were originally doing the pilot for the very first series. Obviously, Ricky's the main character. He's in all the time. It's obviously important. He's had big chance to get something made for tv and this could launch our careers. And I turn up on the Monday, he's twisted his ankle. He has to be wheeled around in a wheelchair because he went out jogging, stepped on a tin can in the street and fell over. Who left that there like a 40. Year old man with Brittle bone disease. He just twisted his ankle. He was out of action. It was pathetic. Yeah, that was the pilot. Pathetic. But I still turned up, Kyle. That's the sort of trooper I am. Well, yeah, but you moaned the whole week. Wait. Well, I didn't have to go around in a wheelchair, did I? It's not pleasant, you know, but in a weird way, it taught me all the problems. Do you have anxiety dreams, Carl? Do you ever lie awake worrying about stuff? Because I have a lot going on in me, Ed. Yeah, a very. I don't have what you do rent out to people. Is it two monkeys swinging in a tie at the moment? Yeah, I just don't have that many dreams. No. You haven't had decent night sleep. You're 14 according to you. Twelve. Really? Yeah. So I know what you meant. I know what you mean though. Now when sometimes you're so tired. Cuz I'd forgotten that you're so tired and you think, well, I'm so glad that to go out tonight I'm gonna go and just lay on the couch and then go to bed. Yeah. Dreams. I do have a. Periodically. Yeah, it used to be a lot of, you know, things like running to jet, to get to school in time, but you know, suddenly your feet are running and you can hear the school bound. I haven't had it for years. I just haven't had an exotic dream for years and years and years. Yeah. Dunno. I don't care. No, well, no, you just genuinely don't care about anything. This is the problem. You've just got to a point now where nothing bothers you, really. It's like you're just too lazy and disinterested in anything. This show, your career. My career, Carl. No, I've never. I never give on, Carl. So, um. Carl. So this little Howie, the bonus, what was your point? Was that. Was that really your point? You wondered if you could live without bones? Yeah, I saw. Saw the little fellow on this program. Yeah. And he was. He was a small fellow and he was talking about Harry the boneless. And I thought, you know, that's. That's interesting. Little bit of science stuff. Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, that's. That's about it on him, really. All right, well, that's just another bonus. Cheeky freak of the week is not. That's not even the freak of the week either. No, no, no, that's still to come. So you've had a pregnant. You've had a pregnant siamese twin. It's been mad. You've had a boneless fella and another fella talking about him. They're not even involved in freak of the week. No. This is getting mad, player. Let's have cheeky freak of the week afterwards. Yeah. Current single from Nick Cave. Can we do monkey news first? I'd rather have a cheeky freak of the week. Nick Cave and the bad seeds. He wants you. Brilliant. Yeah. So, Carl, off you go. Well, we're not gonna do freak of the week here, okay, because we've done quite a bit of that in the last 20 minutes. You think? Yeah, sure. We'll just shift it a little bit. Okay. I don't like to keep saying don't want people to be thinking we're sort of taking the mick out of anyone. No. Right. Because we're not about that. I feel that, like, I can do a little bit of it because I work with. With you, Steve. Yeah, sure. It gives me that. Right. It's like a care worker. Yeah. It's like that thing of. You can't be homophobic because I've got a couple of game mates and stuff. Sure. I think so. It gives me that edge. Yeah. Right. So you're not freak a phobic because you work with Steve. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So, yeah. Okay. By that token, I should be able to sort of slag off, you know, the mentally ill, at least. Mentally handicapped. Now, there's a term you don't hear very often in 2003. I don't know where to start, but I'd like to apologize for the lady Diana stuff. Mentally undercut and any inadvertent racism that we may have done. What's the actual term, then? Is it retarded? Come on, now. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey news earlier than usual. I have to save this link now. Monkey news. We've done a lot of stuff right on monkeys. And most of it has been. No, it's been. Has been like happy stories. Oh, it's just gonna be like our tune. Our monkey tune. Simon Bates. And welcome to our monkey tune. No, I mean, we've done. We've done stuff about a monkey that robbed a bank. Yeah. Why is that happy? You had a great life after that. What, my bear? Yeah, all right. We did the one who saved someone's ambag in a railway station. We had a lovely marriage. Couple of marriages. Of the monkey marriages. Yeah. It was the one who got a job in a railway station. Yeah, the hairdresser. The one who set up a business in Spain. I don't even remember that one. I'm willing to believe that that happened. Go on then, Kyle. But anyway. Yes, so today's isn't. Isn't that. Isn't that happy, really? It's about some monkey. I think it was a chimp. He's an ape. Go on. It tried to. I mean, the story sets off a sort of a weird thing. Yeah. It's something about he went to Russia to do some business. What are you talking about, Carl? I jumped past that bit, though. It didn't start there. What? Do you know what I mean? He didn't tell you what he was doing. He just said, there's this monkey, went to Russia to do some business. Do some stuff. Anyway, didn't work out. They were furious. We wanted a surgeon. You send us a monkey. Um, anyway, ended up being homeless. Oh, no. Taking it over the worst. What could even get into it? You know, like a tree hostel or anything like that. That's. That's. That's the problem. And ended up. Yeah, ended up homeless. Got in with some. Some tramps. Come on, come on, come on. Yeah, so he's knocking about with some tramps and stuff, you know, sharing drink and what have you around. A little fire. They broke into some home. Not sort of squatted. Right. Problem was. Yeah. Roof over his little area. Yeah. And he goes, this is good. This is, you know, we're having a good time. This is sorting me out. Yeah. Yeah. What was he eating? I don't know. Don't know. It didn't say. But they're in this house. Well, he could only be in sort of like, you know, fruit, nuts, vegetables that. I mean, they. Class leaders sort of don't eat, you know, pork pies. And they've got McDonald's in Moscow now, so. Sure. You probably. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, there was a bust. There was a bust in the flat that they were squatting in. All the other trump sort of knew what was going on, legged it and left. Little chimps out there got arrested and they thought it was a real fella at first. They were like, get him. You know, he's obviously just a scruffy bloke who hasn't had a shave and stuff. Yeah, yeah. Hasn't shaved his back for a while or his face. His head got him down the station and the boss was like, what's going on here? We've got a monkey. He was like, what, since you arrested the monkey? Well, so the arresting officers hadn't noticed all the way to the station that he kept slipping out of the handcuffs and was going for the entire journey. They didn't notice till they got there. What, they put a hood over his head, maybe, and just like, you know, I don't know. I'll give you the story if you want. There's the headline. What is it? What's the headline, Steve? I don't want to see it, but the headline. This is once again from supposedly reputable news organization Ananova, homeless monkey arrested in Russia. Did. Sorry, did you read on or did you see the headline and make up that whole story? It's the most. Most of it is there, but what isn't there? What. What bit isn't there, then? I think, you know, Steve can have a look over it. Check it out and stuff. The embellishment for me, Steve, we. Well, what it doesn't say is that the police didn't realize it was a monkey. That's what I was guessing. That's what I was guessing, really, that they got it right. I said, what, you don't? We've got a monkey. And they go, yeah, yeah. Oh, God. There's some more monkey problems in the week. Have you seen the Alfred's advert with monkeys in? No. There's a new advert out for Alfred's selling bikes and stuff. Yeah. Got some monkeys in it. Cause not roll. Why? People are saying it's, you know, dressing up in track suits and that is. Uh, taking the Mickey out of Manchester. You know, it's not nice for the animals and that. So there's been loads of free bike or something. Do they. I think they kept the tracksuit. Yeah. After this cheeky freak of the week. No, I'm just. Just saying we're not doing this to sort of, again, take the mickey out of the animals and stuff. These are true stories and that, but, yeah. Coming next, freak of the week. Kings of Leon. Red morning light on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and little Carl Pilkington. It's getting exciting because it's his special time of the week where he gets to talk about a cheeky freak of the week. Well, just get robbusters out the way, right? Because I've got. I've got to put these prizes in their post bag now, cuz I'm shooting off. Yeah, cuz you gotta go early. So I don't know how you do your job. You went to Manchester, you went to Madeira, you had a day off because your trousers were wet and you had a cold. And now you're shooting down a corn where you're leaving early. How'd you get your work done? And you've got one job. Me and Steve got loads of things to do. I'm fast. Let me work. Like I said, the prize is ready and packed up here. No one's being affected by me shooting off early. Right, okay, so Rockbusters answers. Got to get them out the way a bit earlier. Right, so here they are. First one, uh, he's got american coins all the way down his spine. Yeah. Why would that be? Initial was nickelback. Nickelback. I got all these. I got all these this week. Right? Second one, Jeremy Beadle has got arthritis. What's going on there? Stiff little fingers, slf. Stiff little fingers. Yeah. And the third one, Foxy Shipman and. No. And a country and western singer. You said, now, what's the initial SD? Yeah. So spin doctors. Yeah, I got that, but. And then I said to you, why is it a country and western singer? And you said, doctor Hook. Why is it doctor. Why does that give anyone the clue? Doctor Hook, a country and western singer. It's just. What. What was in my mind. Well, there we are. There you go. So we've changed this to Rockbusters or. What am I thinking? You could have had dry. What's in my mind? You could have had. And the medics. All right, just think it through. Who's the winner? The winner, very lucky. Sandra Cassidy of Leon Sea. She gets all those great prices. You know, we've actually had people emailing in saying, this is the worst rockbusters ever because it was too easy, it was boring. This is. Don't shoot the messenger. Oh. Other people saying it really has run its course. Some people genuinely agree. Oh, Carl, this must hurt, mate. Stinging attacks on you. So you were just slagging you off, generally saying you win all the time. Looks like Steve was right when he saw, like, pooh. Pooh's your ideas. So when he. When he wheeze on your someone else. Like, swear to God, someone else emailed in and said, don't bother sending me the prizes. Take them to a charity shop or pawn them. Give me the money. I'd rather have it. So. I don't know what to say, Carl. I just wonder if it really has run its course now. We'll see what you come up with next week. Let's see what you do. Let's see what you come in with. Sure. Five to one, I'm guessing you'll be popping in with another hip hop track. Yeah. I won't bring it to you. I'll do it myself at home. You can't cope. Oh, dear. Are you actually gonna be here next week or are you still gonna be in Cornwall? No, you see, there again. I'll be back. I'll be back in time and in the. In the week when I go to, you know, Cornwall, see the monkey world. Yeah, you. That still works. What? Thought you're going to interview some of the monkeys. I love that. You were going, could a monkey live without bones as please? Just look at the monkeys and eat your ice cream. And that's work, is it? Right, are we having cheeky freak of the week? Want to do it? What have you got your do with shooting off? Sort of soonish? Okay, be honest, this is not radio. Have you ever heard that on a radio show? Chris? Tara. Shoah. There is train. So I couldn't get to Cornwall tonight. If I had to. If I had to finish this show, I couldn't possibly get to Cornwall. Rubbish. Of course there's a later train. Oh, I've got booked it now. Anyway, point, isn't it? Yeah. You're not. Whatever. I don't think the show's lost anything. I think we've still had the, you know, freak of the week's coming up now. Oh, cheeky. Freak of the week. Right. Well, we've had some interesting things we've been looking at this week. It's. It's about the strangest couple that ever got married. And we've had two sets of chimps, so it's stranger than that. Oh, it's not Dale Wynton. And now Macandrew is not your parents, is it? Well, we're going back again. So now I think this is about 19 something. 1940. Yeah. Strangest couple. A fella, right? He had skin of a lizard. Okay. And the woman who used as a condom. The woman who we married. Yeah. Ariest woman ever, right? And that was their act. They used to tour the world and they'd say, you know, it's like, you know, couple who've met having a great life, let's get them out on stage. Here they are. And what do you mean? Yeah, the skin of a lizard. First of all, that's what. That's what he said. He had some sort of. Some illness. So he was called lizard man. And you like that because it was good description. That's good. I mean, hello. Dude, we booked a table for two. Who? You mean I'm leaning Lizard man always over there. Yeah. You know he is, right? Yeah. I mean, the hairiest woman in the world, she's over there. Yeah. Yeah. So what did they do for their act? Bear in mind that we had some siamese twins last week and their act was having a bathroom. Yeah. Yeah. So I hope it's an improvement on that. What did Lizard man, he came out and ate some flies. Did he? I don't really know. I think. I just think they stood there on that. What do you. When you read this and it goes, the most interesting fact ever, Lizard man. And you go, that's enough. That's enough. I can extrapolate from that. Straight away I start thinking. I'm thinking, right? I wonder if they got the wedding photos. And then, like you said, that they had a kid. Oh, what would that be like? That's what I was thinking. What do you think it would come out like the baby? I didn't think what that looked like. I just was thinking our parents evening. You wouldn't want them coming up to the school. Johnny, who starts off relatively normal, he's quite good at. You know, he's good at nature, isn't he? And, and it's mum and dad come into the room and they'd be looking around, wouldn't they? Well, it's always like that thing at school when, like, you find out your mates mom and dad are really old, right? When you go, you know, your grand and granddad bought you. Yeah. It calls him mum. What was that? I was. Yeah, that's always strange. If you had, if you had, you know, if you had Godzilla and King Kong as your parents and, and it. They're always fighting and, and, you know, like you say, if you're in a school play or something, you wouldn't tell him, would you? You wouldn't want to come out with the video camera. He didn't tell his parents he was in it when we. Exactly. You did, little donkey. You didn't tell your dad, did you? And he came along and videoed it. Yeah. Was that quiet? Kept it quiet. Don't want to know anything. But you didn't. What was it? It was meant to be playing. You had a little drum, didn't yeah. Yeah, I was doing. Had a little drum. I think I was meant to be playing we three kings. Yeah. But he started doing little donking. I thought, I can add a touch to this. Sure. You improvised. Started playing. A lot of it was like the. First remix, wasn't it? It went down well, but, yeah, that's, that's all I was thinking with the freak of the week this week. That's. That's what I'm saying about freak of the week. It's to get people thinking right, thinking how lucky they are that, you know. They don't have to comb their face. What are you talking about? What do you mean? Freak of the week? Is to let people know how lucky they are. Just. What about the little freak you're talking about? What are they thinking? They're going, oh, he's talking about me. I'm a little airy lizard man on a stick. Pop in, give us a call. You know, that's, that's what I'd like to do on a tv program. That's what I want to do. I want to go and, like, meet these people and say, right, let's just go shopping. Let's you know, we'll film what your normal days like. Yeah, let's pop out, Nick into Sainsbury's or whatever. Yeah. Buy a comb right up close to it. Yeah, yeah. So what you're saying is you just want to get a little message out there, which is that there's always someone worse off than you. Well, there's proof of that in this room. Carl, when's your train? In a minute. I'm gonna get going now. I'll see you later. Thanks, Carl. Brilliant. What are you planning to play? A song. Kirsten McCall. Yeah, I'll see you later. Kirsty McCall, New England. Kyle Pilgerton has left the building. He's rushed away. He's on his way down to Cornwall. And we're left by ourselves. Indeed, in the room. See if we can do this, if. We can press all the buttons and not make any mistakes. Strictly speaking, there's no need for Carl. I don't mind if it makes mistakes. Well, no, we never worried in the old days. I think Carl is gonna love Cornwall because I think one. The mayor is probably an animal. Yes. And I imagine the townsfolk think like Carl. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? I imagine he'd probably stay there, it'd be made king. Have you ever seen Return of the Jedi? Return of the Jedi? The Ewoks, the little furry creatures. They see c three po. And because he can talk and he's. And he can speak that language, they actually elevate him. Oh, he's a godlike status. What are you doing here? Hooray, he's back. What are you doing? You can stay till the end. What you doing? What are you doing? Right, right. Well, there he is. He's on his way. Yeah. If you were listening online in Cornwall, I mean, I can't imagine that's ever. Going to happen on a clothesline with a bean tin at one end and a big bean tin in London. Or if I'm calling London. Yeah. Or if the foil helmet you wear to fend off laser rays from alien Tower space and somehow picking up the show, then Carl's on his way. Look forward because he's got a sort of like, you know, the obligatory sort of red face that go well down there now. Because I think he's been out in the CERN, or he was, you know, pre boiled when he came in. But he's rushing down to Cornwall now, going from Paddington station. So, you know, if you want. If you hang in, if you're in the Paddington station area, you want to pop down there and wave him off, then do. Yeah, don't be afraid. That's not, that's not a dirty sexual act. Wave him off. Yeah, wave him off. And call in the week as well. Carl dot pilgrim dot co dot uk. Send him anything, just clog up his email. I mean, because he gets stressed at work. So if you can send him three or four emails each over the next week. So he's got to read them all. But disguise him, don't make him look rubbish. So he's. At least he's got sort of open and we'll look at them or, you know, some of them might be correspondent, so he will is, you know, just phone his line as well. Just ask for XF Carl and leave long messages on his voicemail. So if you can, just for us, just for me and Steve, remember, it is mine and Steve's show. Carl is merely like, you know, the icing on the cake. If Carl can come back maybe next Friday or Saturday or Monday, whenever he comes back to about 250 emails and 200 voicemail messages. If you put down when it says, what's the name of the message? To title the message. If you put monkey news or monkey information, they'll have to open it then because you'll be intrigued, even if it's not about monkeys. Yeah, do that anyway. Yeah. And, yeah, voicemail message, leave them long. I like this information disguise. It might be important. Yeah, just so he has to listen through. I wish I'd give his own mobile out, but you know, that, that is just too cruel. But anyone can get him at XFM. And of course, we've given out his email before, so, I mean, go, men. There are plenty of ways to torture Carl Pilkington. I mean, we've, we're doing all we can on a Saturday, but we're only. Two people, you know, I mean, so listen, go, go berserk. We'll, we'll be back next Saturday and leave with a song for. A song for the lover, song for the ladies, whatever. It's a beautiful track. A song for the sunshine. Song for the sunshine. It's Lily White by Kat Stevens. And we've done it. We don't need Carl. Definitely not. See you next week, Rick. Bye.",
