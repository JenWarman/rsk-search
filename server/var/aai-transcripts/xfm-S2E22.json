I'm gonna be honest, I'm gonna own up straight away. I've done very little work towards this show this week. Surprised me. Yeah. Yeah. So I apologize if it sounds a bit sort of. Thanks for being honest, though. Well, no, I don't, you know, I don't know. It's a bit shoddy this week. I told me that every week, so it is because I've done very little preparation. Okay. So. Right. You know, normally you'll probably have to help me out. All right. You have to do some of the, some of the work. Carl, you might have to help us out a little bit as well. I don't know. I mean, I know Steve's done nothing towards it either. So the onus is on you a little bit here. I love the fact that it's still listed as either Ricky Gervais or Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. And, you know, essentially we don't need. To be here really. No, I know. Now people listen for Carl, everyone I've spoken to for, you know, people on buses to comedians like Ross Noble mentioned you the other day and that, you know, they go, people on buses? I've never been on a bus. You haven't been on a bus for like twelve years. People on buses. I don't know why I find that so funny. I just know being on a bus, the idea of you being on a. Bus, they're shouting out from the window. They're going, I love Carl. Right? I'm walking along. How much is it on the bus? 20 pence. Come on, seriously, how much is it? One adult. The terminus, please. I love the fact, you know, they do that thing where like if they're interviewing Paul Newman or someone famous, they always say, how much is a pint of milk? And that's supposed to prove if you're sort of still in touch with your roots or whether you're too big a celebrity. Yeah. You've got no idea how much it costs on the bus. Quid. It's not quid. 120. No, it's not 120. Pint of milk. About 50 p. 30 p. Oh, brilliant. Because, I mean, it's fascinating because you gave this stuff, I mean, you gave this stuff up before you became a celebrity, didn't you? Were always lazy because people always say to me like, oh, you know, Ricky seems a bit obnoxious. Who comes up to you and just. Says that the guy on the tube did it. I said. He came up. He said. He said, I was watching an interview with Ricky. He said, he's not a nice piece of work. I went, well, I mean, he said, no, I've got friends like that, you know, just. And it's like they're always talking. They're a bit irritating, you know, and you sort of let them off because they're your mates. But I was going, well, hang on a minute. You went two things, you know, it's sort of my job, talking and being interviewed, essentially. You do have to talk. Yeah. About yourself. If that's his only criticism, then I'm not too bad. No, he didn't think you were funny, either. In fact, he had a whole list. Well, I say a list of petition. It wasn't Dicky Anderson, was it? It wasn't Richard Anderson. I hope he's listening. He's our biggest fan. I'll tell you what, mock turtles need a remix by Fatboy Slim, don't they? Mock turtles? It's a great tune, but I'd love to hear it remixed. Yeah. Can you dig it remixed by Slim? Yeah. Yeah. XFM 104.9, Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Stuff. Stuff to do. Talk about and that. Oh, before you came in. Oh, you saw it, didn't you? That experiment I was doing with it? An experiment? Yeah. Well, all I know is, as I walked in the building, I passed a little kitchen area. You were hitting Carl on the head with a tin tray. Didn't it make a good noise? It was a great noise, but I interested. Explain more about the experiment. Well, I wanted to see how hard I could hit him and make it resonate right before. Either caved his skull in or, you know, I mean, so you had to hold it quite loose so it could, like, vibrate, but you had to grip it hard enough to give it a good whack. And his head's brilliant for hitting Stefani. It is perfect, because we recreate that. Moment a bit later on the radio. You'll notice that you've been on for 15 minutes, haven't said a word. It's had a bit of an effect on me. Still a little bit shaken. Oh, dear. But, yeah, do it again later. We were talking about your head a little bit earlier, weren't we? It's not gonna mean that you're sort of a bit, you know, fuzzy thinking, is it? Yeah. Towards the end of the show, just hit you on the head with various. Objects, see, which make the best sound about timeout. I said something in time out and he went, ah, yeah. Do you read that? I went, yeah, yeah. I read it every week. Yeah. He went, there's no point, though, is it? Because it's like a telephone directory, you know, if you want to look some up, you look it up. But you'd never sort of browse the telephone directory. And I went, that's interesting point. You went, although I did. When I was in Scotland, I just looked up how many Macs there were and there was 42 pages of them. How bored are you in your hotel room in Scotland to suddenly start working out? How many people start with Mac? Did you, were you sat in the room? There is nothing else that you can think of working. It's when we did the show from, you know, XFM, did some stuff from Edinburgh. Yeah. You were sitting in a dino room. Sat in the room waiting to sort of go out and get some food and that sat there. Why were you waiting to go out and get some food? We're gonna meet up. We're gonna meet up with, you know, sign. So you thought, I'm not gonna switch the tv on, I'm not gonna read about it. Telly was on, nothing was on. I wasn't impressed with anything that was on. So I'm looking around the room. I had a couple of the free shortbreads. I love the fact that he remembers. He remembers a specific biscuit he had. That's fantastic. I had a couple of them and then looked around, there was a Bible and thought, well, I know about that. Yeah. There's nothing in that. I don't know. So got the phone book up and immediately thought, there's a lot of Mac this, a Mac that, in Scotland. I wonder how popular it is, 42 pages of Max. Did you count how many pages they were? Yeah. Did you. Did you just work out from the numbers on the bottom of the page or did you literally count it? Counted. Right. And. And how many do you reckon are on a page? There's a lot in there. If someone can tell you approximately how many names they get on one page. How long did it take you, this whole procedure, the counting? Not that long. Once you digested that information, what. What did you do with that information? Did you tell. I mean, look, how long ago was the Edinburgh? I love to get in his head. I was at a big warehouse and there's lots of partitions for weird stuff like kids born with tentacles. Yeah. And things like that. I think I mentioned it's like quite an old caretaker and you go in there, you say, I'm looking for that. He goes, hang on, hang on. I know where that. I put that somewhere. Is this the one when they shave the cap? No, it's not shaving the cat. This is the max. The max? I know Scotland. The shortbread. Don't give me the shortbread because that's putting me off. But what's her name, though? Do you remember last week I was talking about the airy kid? And I think that's every week, Carl. That doesn't narrow it down. All right, well, we're talking about that airy kid in the woods and did a bit more research this week. Okay. Found a good story out about a monkey, right? Which I'll tell Ricky a little bit about it. Tell me, come on, tell it now. No, it sounds exciting. Stuff that's gotten. Right, so we'll be doing that. We've got rockbusters again this week. Yeah. We've got doing Edom. Yeah. What you trying to get rid of this week? Cockroaches. Right. I can't think of a reason to. Keep them looking into that. Well, sort them out. That's coming up. We've got. I'm teaching you some more stuff. Oh, yeah? Yeah. He phoned me up today. Yesterday was. He knows we're researching, like educating Ricky. He said, what do you want to know about? I said, you interested in space? And I went, yeah, phones me 3 hours later, went, no, nothing about space. I went, what? He said, I couldn't find anything interesting. I said, you couldn't find anything interesting about space? Yeah, it's big. It's pretty interesting, but there's nothing there. It's like the millennium dome I'm looking at, right? But no way. He said, is there anything else you want to know about? I went, all right. Went, anthropology. He went, what's that? I went, study a man. I sent a man. He went, like what? I went, like, I. Roots from caveman through and all that. He went. I said, australopithecus Neanderthal. He went, well, you know, all that. Then I went, no. He went, don't know how a lung works or something. How a lung works. And I said, well, tell me how fridge works. He went, oh. I said, it's just the gas in it. I went, brilliant. I went to microwave works. Went, I know. I said, fella walking past in a laboratory with a bar of chocolate in his pocket, went past some sort of ray thing. It mounted it, and he went on, that's it. That's. That's explained to me how a microwave works. Right, so today we're doing sort of medical ish type things under the banner of colon. Then educate me. Oh, God, do it again. Colon. Then educate me. Brilliant. Brilliant. So that's like. Go on then. So, Colon. So that's. That's a little heading. You're going to be learning three things, sort of medical ish before 03:00 is that it? Pretty much, yeah. A bit of suede. How many O'Reilly's are there, do you think? Suede. Animal nitrate. That's really got a Johnny Maher influence at the end, that guitar. XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Tell us about this monkey, Carl. You're gonna love this one, Steve. Right, yeah. So last week we were talking about how like, a lad left his family because there's problems at home and that he went and lived in the wood. He got airy. No, leave it there. We haven't got time to go inside. That's what happened. And that's what happened. He lived with the monkeys. He went airy. That's what happened. Looked into some other stuff about like, airy kids and all that. Came across this story about a bloke, right, who worked in a zoo. Oh, dear. Right. So troubles brewing. Loving his job in that. But it's quite a lonely sort of job because you don't see many people. You're just dealing with animals all the time. Right. So anyway, it gets a bit pally with a monkey because it's the closest thing to. To a human. Well, that he pissed. Right. Yeah. But you can't really go that close to apes. What do you mean? What type was it with chimpanzee, I. Reckon it was a chimp. Yeah. Yeah. I don't even know. So that's a nice. Okay. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. So he gets Pally with him. Right? So he gets pally with it together. Well, no, I mean, it starts off. Starts off just checking each other out and, you know, probably sharing lunch and that together. Yeah. Right. Anyway, this goes on for a while, is, you know, they're getting on well on that. And then after a while, right, the monkey starts sort of imitating him a bit more and sort of walking upright. Oh, God. Yeah. Right. So he thinks, oh, that's a bit weird. Anyway, they get on really better and what have you. So he thinks he could. He could live at home with me, this. Yeah, we're getting on the storm. Yeah. So he takes him home and before. Beginning of beneath the planet, the apes. I think it is. I think you've seen this on video. I'm worried because he's already imitating you and they're moving in together. I'm thinking it's maybe like single white female. Single white zookeeper. Brilliant. So anyway, so it's moving in and it's getting used to sort of the normal human life. He's having a cup of tea in the morning. Yeah. PG tips as a. Finishes the day off. With what? Finishes the day off with a little brandy. Is he wearing a smoking jacket? Yeah. I tell you what, Carl, you're a maniac. This is why it attracted me. It's amazing, right? Having his brandy and that, loving his life. Next thing you know, he sort of. I don't know if he loses it or he gets shaved, but the top half of his body is hairless. Hairless, right. Apart from his head. Right. So he's got the opposite of the kid. Yeah, that would happen. But. So you don't know if you. How did it say, then? The hairless what? What? I'll bring it in for you. The story and then you. So anyway, so, so this is going on and he's having a great life. Then the zookeeper starts getting a bit annoyed because he's having a better life than the zookeeper. The zookeepers in the zook. This is such. So the zookeeper's still got to do a day's work. The monkeys at home, he's partying. There's no point you coming in to the zoo, because the whole reason of you being there was because you've been kept there and he didn't want to bring the memories back. So he said, you stay at home. You are talking such as, let him finish. God, I don't know if I can sit here and listen to this drivel. Let me. I. It's nearly over. Anyway, it sounds extraordinary. So he's walking upright, he's having a tea in the morning, finishing the day off with brandy. Gets a bit out of hand, only tries it on with the zookeeper's wife. How does he do that? Well, because he's around humans a lot. He becomes a bit of a charmer. But what is it that he could. Do to seduce her? Pick fleas out of her? He didn't say. He's built. He was built. Yeah. What about that? What do you mean, what about it, Carl? It's obviously not true. It's obviously not true. This wasn't on the Internet, this was in a book. So it's not a quick joke. And just put it on a website. This is in a book. I don't understand how that is. I love that he becomes a charmer. He's got better taste in brandy. And he. Oh, what was it that he was doing that seduced her? I don't know. Maybe because he was at home more than the zookeeper was. But what would he be doing? He's not gonna be talking with her. They're not gonna be playing trivia pursuit. Maybe. Maybe she liked the silent type. It didn't go into that. It just said that's when the trouble started. Is that what Suzanne did when she brought you up? Feeder? Just the way I'm feeling. XFN 104.9 I love that. Carl. You're good. You're panicking. You've just remembered a song from your childhood and I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm gonna give out a number. Please take this number down if you can help, Carl. It's zero 8700-800-1234 right. I'm not that bothered. We were talking about a track from the sixties. Yeah, mighty Quinn. Yeah. And it was on the same compilation. We died at a tape in the car. And the tape was always on in the. In the stereo thing in the car. And I used to sit, sort of sit through all this stuff I didn't like. But knowing that coming up soon was a song about a monster with purple eyes. It was part of the magic dragon. It wasn't. Wasn't that a monster? There must be some house about it. That remember a chorus or a few lines. It says something like, it was a one eyed. It had big eyes, purple. And it eats people or something. The big eyed purple eater. Wasn't there a song called something like that, big guy? There was a song which is something like the intergalactic purple year or something. It's some light. It's a novelty song. Rubbish. What the. By the Bonzo, that sort of thing. Yeah, I'm sure. Mad. We'll find out in a bit. I mean, I'm not that bothered. I'm not gonna buy it. It's just that we're talking about songs and that. It'll be good to know it was, but. Yeah. Right. Rockbusters. Okay. Hello. All right? Yeah. What you want? That's the bit I want. What's the name of the song? Oh, yeah. So I don't think you've helped much, though. You can't. You can't remember what it's called or who it's by? Well, no, I mean, I know the tune. That's about it. Done. Well, he's given up his spare time to call in and sing as a song. Don't diss him, Rick. I'm concerned he's just only marginally remembering it more than Carly. It was actually in. I think it was in the blob. No, it wasn't in something like the blob, actually. I think Steve McQueen was driving away and it was running in a. This seems so very familiar. See if it. Thanks very much, mate. See if we can get a title off someone. And RX FM. I know the name of that shoe. Go on, boys at the purple eyed people eater. Yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah, I'll just. I'm just at work. And who is it by? Came to my mind. Do you know who's by? I know it's by, mate. Sorry, there's not enough information. I wouldn't phone in. We asked them just what the gym was. I want someone like Paul Gambitini to call it. He knows what. You know what. You know, the title. We can put it in the Internet, can't we, in fact, find out who did it? Yeah, that's full of brilliant. Thank. Thank you very much. I just think if you're gonna bother to call in a radio station, have the facts. He hasn't got the facts and he runs the radio station. He doesn't run it. They keep me like a mascot. He's like a pet, isn't he? They have running around the office now. Listen, it's rockbusters. I've got the. The prizes here, Rick, I'll be honest with you. I mean, we've given away some. Some shoddy stuff in the past, but. It'S the worst collection. Is it? This is really scraping the bottom of the barrel, Carl. I mean, if you're still phone and hang up, because we're not gonna bother anymore. We really. Sorry about that. Maybe email this or summer. How many of these can we give away? Look at that. It's only fools nurses that it's a Christmas special from. Not this year. The year before. Yeah. I mean, we have given away so many of these. I imagine there's charity shops, so we got that. And, you know, if you didn't watch it, you know, if you weren't 20. Million that watch blue eyed, fat legged, purple eat a people, if they had a big boo, it's something like that. And once again, the best chill out album ever with. I mean, it's pretty much rubbish. It was a big boo boo, actually. No, the songs were okay. It's just basically a collection of songs you might have heard on adverts, so enjoy that. Oh, God. This one again. The best air guitar album in the world. Volume. This is no longer an entertainment show. This is three people chatting to each other now and again. Sometimes we remember it's going out. Sometimes we just take a call for an amusement. I mean. It'S the same place again. It's the David Attenborough compilation of DVD's, which I'd be very surprised if actually makes it to you. I imagine someone here will have had. That long before he posted. Oh, dear. There's a t shirt in here. Exfm 104.9. You get sent a lot of crap. What you're listening to. What is that? What t shirt is? That's a t shirt made by the quicksilver people. So if you're a bit of a surfer dude, and by the look of the size of it, you're a midget. You'Ve got the same midget. You're welcome to it. And this is, I think, the piece de resistance, Rick. I mean, you know the kind of fans we have. They're pretty cool cats. Pretty groovy guys. Yeah, yeah. Imagine they'll be loving on DVD. Doctor who. The aztecs. That's one of William Hartnell. The first doctor's classic episodes on DVD there. Oh, you know, that's rubbish, Carl. Those places. I'm ashamed to give him away. Carl, you know our mate Johnny, he's a doctor who fan. Yeah. Do you remember he bought the doctor who magazine and he went to the toilet and Steve got post it notes and put geek on every page. And Johnny opened it on the tube, right? And it had geek and everything. And Johnny brought in, did the new doctor who magazine, I think this week's or this month's, right? And they've, they've, they've done the perfect doctor who fan, right? What? The geek is, right? And it looks exactly like Steve. All right? Don't ever go. It does anyone. I'm going to try and put it on the website. It's amazing. It's got your hair, glasses, it stands like you, it's sort of dressed like you and it's only hilarious. And he's. He was. I mean, I'm insulting you now. It sounds like an insult, but if you see it, you'd like player. Well, rockbusters. Right? Yeah. Right. Here we go. Just a little bit annoyed. Just, uh, three clues. Well, I'm just. I can't get over that insult. I'm just a little camaraderie on this. Email in Ricky Saxfm dot co dot uk. I'm just reading out the clues. Should we put this. Let's put this one in for the Sony award. Let's put this show in for the Sony award. Play a song, carl, because I need to discuss things with him. I've talked before about. Get this down to three minutes. It'd be a great rock busters in a minute. Lonesome day by Bruce Springsteen from his new album the rising on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervaise. Steve Merchant. Karl Pilkington, former. Just phoned in and said to Carl, stick up for yourself. Don't listen to that merchant. He does my Ed and he's so arrogant. I don't think I'm arrogant. I think. I mean, yeah. Just think I'm sort of objectionable. I don't think it's arrogance. Nastiness. Yeah. I'm just not a very nice person, but I'm not arrogant. I think I'm pathetic. We've had a lot of emails saying, could you bring back white van, Carl? Oh, yeah. Which is that section of the show where we ask the questions that the. Sun asks someone else. Random punters. Yeah. Of Carl. But sadly, recently they got very politicized and very kind of, basically a little bit depressing. So there's not really anything appropriate. But I have trawled the papers looking for other questions posed in other sections of the sun. Good idea. I was just looking here at the dear, dear Dre section, which is the sort of problem page. I don't know what your views are on this. I'd love to see Carl. Oh, God. Can we get him a job? Ask. Oh, my God. That would be amazing. Right, well, here's one. I'd like to see your view on this, Carl. I'm a happy, married 42 year old woman with four kids, yet I've developed a huge crush on pop star Darius Dinesh. Yeah, it sent my hormone levels through the roof. And last night I woke my husband up at 04:00 a.m. For sex. We've been married for 20 years and he can't believe his luck. Recently, I've been having. I want to. Sorry. I want to go to her. I'll stop you there. Why are you telling me? Why? Carry on. Sorry. Recently, I've been having erotic thoughts about Darius morning, noon and night. I haven't felt like this since I was a teenager and mad about Donny Osmond. My husband is amazed at the change in me. We had sex twice last night and again this morning. Why are you telling me this? Yeah, go on. He's just boasting. This is not a problem. It's not a problem. What's the problem? No problem. Just wanted to tell someone. Thanks very much. I watched Darius on tv last night and when my husband came home, I dragged him into the kitchen and we made mad, passionate love. Right. They've done it. They did it, then twice last night, once this morning. That's four times. Five to five times she's mentioned it so far. Yeah, she's doing all right. My husband. This is. This is great. My husband thinks it might be his new moustache or that I'm going through the menopause. I love the idea. That's what he thinks, is he's telling his mates in the pub. Five times. Hooray for sexy Darius. So what do you make of that, then? What? Your views on that. Hold on, though. If that bloke is reading that paper, that narrows it down. Yeah. Who else did he know? His wife likes Darius. He's had sex five times that night and he grew a new moustache. He's thinking, I wonder if that's me. Maureen. Yeah, go on. But what's your concern? Because she. I tell you what her problem is. She's worried that, you know, the reason that she's now kind of overly excited and she's having this great sex with her husband is because she's actually fantasizing about someone completely different, younger. She's having these wayward thoughts, isn't she's? Bit concerned about that. What? You can say what? Your thoughts. I reckon she's gonna start shoplifting soon. Coming out flushes. Go on. They're both happy, aren't he's getting what he wants and she's happy. I'd say, yeah, whatever, get on with it. Do you think that she could confess she wants to be honest with him? I wouldn't, because not. Not that many fellas like Darius. Right. So if you sort of think, you know, she'd rather have him than me. What do you think Darius would think of this? He's probably be happy with that. I mean, what would you do? What would you do if you got loads of phone calls, right, from women going, Carl, whenever you're on the radio, I just have to do it. I just have to do it. Your voice makes me. I say, all right, well, you know, it's all right. I'll be happy with that. Yeah. Just in case anyone is doing that. What would you do to sort of, like, egg them on? A little bit to help them out. What do you think? What sexy things would you say? What do you think is your quality? What do you think people would find, you know, pretty horny about you? Is it your sort of mank wine? Do you think that just. Just say this London shit in it, you know, London. It's not that good, is it? Oh, I think you've done it there. So. So let's say something quite sort of sexy, though. Say something like, you know, wow, I love to love, you. Know. Do you love me? I go, yeah, you're all right. I know, that's true. Yeah, I know that's true. That's. That's brilliant. Because one of the things that Deidre says is that she's. She's wondering if this marriage is going a little bit stale and needs to be freshened up. They need to give a new spice, a new spin to the marriage. What would you do? What advice would you give to spice up, you know, something that they've been married for quite some time. Get them. Get them, I think, get Darius. All Darius things. Get David Sneddon's new video on the telly. What do you reckon, though, Carl? Just. Just treat them. Do you know what I mean? Just surprise them now and again with stuff. That's what I do. It's. What. You got those condoms, didn't you, that you got two. Hang on. What? You've never done that. What? You've surprised Suzanne with what? You know, I've like, used to behind. The door and show it. Don't drop the jelly, you know, just. Just the usual stuff. There was some free chocolate delivered to work the other day. I took her a bit of that home. Nice of you, that's pretty thoughtful. She didn't like dark chocolate, but I said, well, that's a thought. So I had it. But, you know, you often benefit from any gift that you give her. The chocolate, the meal, the condoms. There's always something in it for you. Yeah, there is. I love the idea. She's got bored with a Christmas present now, though. What, the condoms? Yeah. Or the food that she ate. Condoms? Yeah. She's got tired of filling them with water, throwing them at the passing kids or putting them on their head and inflating them. I love the idea of asking problems. What do you think of erectile problems? You like Pele advert? He goes, be careful. We haven't got erectile problems. Call this number. What would you do if you're impotent? What would you do? What's the advertising? Just saying that, you know, if you. Can'T, you know, I haven't seen that. Why have they got him doing it? Wow. Well, you know, you should be able to keep it up for hours, the ball and. Yeah. What do you do if you advertise that? No, if you suddenly couldn't get. You know what, I don't think it'd bother me. Now, I know you're 30, you're talking. Like you're an 80 year old. Yeah, but do you know what I mean? You sort of been there, done that now. It's like the boxing and the dancing that I did. It was good as a kid. Like, take it, leave it. Super grass, seeing the light. XFM 104.9. We're a little bit worried we might have a technical hitch here. We've had no emails and usually we get loads and loads, so we're worried it's us. Can someone send an email? Well, yeah, just a test email. Yeah, but we won't know if they have or not. They might just be ignoring us. No one might be listening, Steve, so this isn't proof. I guarantee this. At least one person who would send an email, maybe if Dicky Anderson's listening, he could do it for us. Anders, Anders, do us a favor. For all the pleasure we've given you over the last few years. Ricky Gervais at XFM dot co dot UK busters. Might as well give them out. Well, let's check the emails working before. We do that, yeah? Otherwise it said, complete. This. This whole show has been a sham and a farce and a waste of time. Well, I think they can take that as red. Well, educate me, Carl. Right, well, educate me. Well, what we. What we're looking at this week, we've. We've done war. We've done, um. We've nailed that. We've nailed war. We summed up war with a little french bloke whose battle cry was John's got a moustache. All right, so. And last week we did science. What would you on science? Enough. Airy kid. Brilliant. Right? Yeah. So this week we're looking at medical problems. I'm sure we do arrike it every week. Medical problems then I've got a couple of things under the banner of colon. Then educate me. Yeah, we've got. This is interesting, right? Now, if you have an operation on your brain, right, what they do is the. I mean, this is why I'd never go to the doctors. I don't like doctors because this sort of stuff freaks me out, right? They can operate on your brain. And what they do is they put you to sleep first, cut your brain case open. Your brain case. Yeah, yeah. And then wake you up and operate on you. So you sat there with your head open, yeah. Messing with your brain and you don't feel anything. There's no nerve endings, is there, in the brain? But still it's not right, is it? Is it what, you think they do it for fun? No, they go on, reggie, wake him up so he looks freak tape. Is it necessary that you're awake, do you think? Or they need the brain active, don't they? Yeah, but is when you're asleep, you're having mad dreams. I had a mad dream the other day. God, no. I might tell you about later, but there's no sense to it. But. So your brain's still your brain. Where is this conversation? Yeah, I mean, it'll turn out, I'll go, no, Carl, I was there, that wasn't a dream. Yeah, no, so, I mean, if I. Had an operation on your brain, heaven forbid. Operation. Anyway, I'd like to sort of think, well, I'll have an injection, I'll go asleep, but when I wake up, it'll all be sorted. Yeah. The fact that your brain case is open, open. And they wake you up and you think, oh, is it all done? They say, we'll have a look in the mirror and you see. I don't think they do that. I don't think they try and frighten you when you're doing an operation. Yeah, I don't think that. You go about your business and they sort of follow you around dabbling. Yeah, it's almost like they are having a bit of a laugh with you. Right, well, I just like to say now that they don't. Anyone who's going in for an operation on their head, do not ever listen to anything. Why have you got to be awake? Because you'll be bored anyway. You'll be sat there. They give you a telephone director look, and they say, look, how many Macs are in there? That's the scottish telephone directory. And you know, time flies when you're counting that sort of thing. No, but you know, like when you. What you are. What? You telling me what? You ask how weird it is. It's weird and it's like, do you know when you go for haircut? Right, it's a bit embarrassing. Well, I don't anymore. But when you go for haircut, it used to be. When you go for haircut, it used. To be a bit embarrassing when, like, they'd wet your hair. And they'd make you have that sort of Hitler cut because your hair's wet. And I used to hate it. And I think you have to do that. Do you know what I mean? It's very similar to open skull. It's almost like barbers like to do that to make you look daft and feel daft for a bit. And there's women coming in and out and you're sat there with a daft haircut. Yeah. And this is what that reminds me. Do you think that. Do you think they do it in a shop window, this brain operation? I'm just saying it's a bit. Why are we doing in John Lewis's? Just so more people. That's what doctors are doing. Let's make this guy look a bit stupid, yeah? Open his brain. Look at the twat. He looks with his brain out of his head. Take a Polaroid regularly, like, clock his face when I give him the mirror, get this on camera. Put this fake news and glass. Did you teach me something then? Was that education? I told you that your brain, your brain case can be open with your awake and you just sat there sort of letting them get on with it. Brilliant. I've learned that. I'll never forget that. Right, go on. Anything else you love? Let's play a song because the next one is amazing. What, even more amazing than that? Yeah, play a song. Yeah. Bit of Bowie. No email still, by the way. No, I don't think it's working. Stardust. We'll have to do a phone in. For rockbusters off the Ziggy Stardust album. All right. David Bowie. When's that ever? Anyone? Steve? Never. Lady Stardust off Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars on XFM 104.9. I'm looking at Gervaise. Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkington is in the middle of educating me. Cole, on. Then educate me. Right, so I've learned that you can, you know, fiddle around with your brain when awake. That's brilliant. I've never been a fan of doctors, though, so this was a good one for me to look up because. Yeah. Did I tell you the time when the doctor said I was gonna die? All right, keep talking. Right, ages ago. Wasn't about 15, right? And at lunchtime there was this. We used to have a choice of stuff to do at lunchtime, right? Used to have like a. Like a burger place that had an arcade machine in it, right? So we used to go there and play on that and have a burger. Or there was this baker's that my mum worked at and did great cakes and stuff, right? So she used to, like, bring some home in that. But she couldn't always bring them home every night because, you know, they cost money and she used to get them for free and they used to say they'd rather chuck them away than give them to the staff because there's a chance that the cream might be off. Right, right. So they used to chuck them around the back. So I used to go around the back with my mate and eat a lot. Brilliant. Scout means it eating out of bins. No, it was really. It wasn't out of bins. They were still in trays, but they just stacked them up near the bins. Right. So this got out. I mean, it used to be chocka. Once the school found out, everybody used to go there and it'd be like, well, have a cake. Fighting the kids off, right? So I'd have like, you know, you just eat, I don't know, six jam donuts or something, and then you'd spend your dinner money on the arcade machine, right? So it was a good, good afternoon, really. Right, so you do that and this one day I must have had six or seven jam donuts. Few congress tarts, just. I love them. It's me. I can't get them in London, right? So I'd have some of them. And if anyone can get a congress for Carl in London, please let him know. So anyway, this day, that was just a normal day, do you know? I mean, you'd once, twice a week. You'D have a load of cake in your life. Yeah. Were the frog boys there with it? With the webbed hands and the big heads and the horse in the city? But the day after, one of these days, I had really bad cramp in my belly. I was like, in agony. Could hardly walk. So I said to my mom, hardly. Staggered to the free cakes, so I. Was in absolute agony. I said, I think I don't like doctors, but you have to get a doctor in because I don't know what it is. I can't walk. She gets the doctor around. I won't say his name, but he said, well, doesn't look like he's got long left. Blimey. So I was a bit like, hang on a minute, I've only had a few creamed donuts. My man was panicking. Sure. He went, my dad came in from work. She said, oh, something's really bad. We can't think it's serious, you know. The doctor said, ain't got long left so he said what? He said that and just left. So she said, yeah, so I'll have to call him, then. So he called him up, said, what's all this about? You know, Carl hasn't got long left. How long has he got? So he goes, oh, it's only messing. She's got. Just had some bad cream. Can you believe that? Well, the thing is, I like the. Fact your mom didn't ask any questions. Can you explain more, doctor? No, I got a shoe off. She doesn't. You know, I don't want to diss you or your family, but I imagine if I was there, I'd have known the doctor was joking. That's all I'm saying. I mean, I sound very arrogant there, but I imagine he went, what have you done? I had about six cream curves. All right. Oh, wow. He hasn't got long to live, then. I'll see you later. That's what I think the doctor. Did. Your mom just let him go? Yeah, terrified, thinking, well, I'm not gonna prove him. He sees, that's it. Then dad comes in. Hi, honey, I'm home. Anything happened? That doctor said Carl's gonna die and then left. Did he? I'll call him. But anyway, that's why these sort of things fascinate me. So we'll move on to this next one, right, which is brilliant. Short story. So, right, old woman, about 70 years old, she's normally fit and healthy and stuff. Nothing wrong with her, she's having a good life. And one day she goes for a check to the doctors, just to check herself out. She's getting on a bit, yeah. Says, take your clothes off and that. So she does and checks her out, says, yeah, you're looking good, you're looking good. Turn round. He said, oh, God. So you got a tumor on your buttocks. Right? So she goes, oh, what can you do? Anything to sort out. So they go, yeah, yeah, yeah. We book you in for an operation. It's best if we remove this. Books are in for an operation. Operation Day comes stripper down and that. They're all stood around. The doctors start to operate. It only turns out it's a pork chop that she sat on five years earlier and it had stuck to a buttock. Right, Carl, I can forward you. I'm honest. Right, no, listen, seriously now, I'm leaving. I'm never. I'm never doing the show again. No, I'm serious, honestly, I've never had any such. But you are. Play record. Play record. I can believe it. What do you mean, you can't believe. Stop the record. Stop the record. Stop the record. Right, okay. Right. What do you mean you couldn't believe it? No, when I read it, I said, I've got to tell. This woman had a pork chop stuck to her ass for five years, you mental case. Of course she didn't. Syntax prior, XFM 104.9 because you race Steve Merchant, Karl Pilgrimton. Right, get off. Right, what you got next? Right, well, running a bit late with this, but it's time for. Do we need them? We're looking into what? I'm really worried about this because everyone's getting that last clue wrong. I reckon it's so rubbish that even your mental fans can't work out. Yeah, it's a tough one, but give. That final rockbusters clue again. The jamaican fellow at twelve, some aspirin. Why is that? Why did he have to do it? That's changed. Well, I mean, does matter, the stuff. That'S the point of a cryptic clue in it. Oh, do, do. What have you got now? Right, so we're looking into animals that we get rid of. I've spoken to someone about snails, I spoke to someone about jellyfish and that and looking at cockroaches today. Right. Now, who's the expert? This woman called Jessica Marshall. Right. Does she know that you're going to play this on the radio? Well, I called up, right in the week and said, can I talk to someone about cockroaches? And she was like, is that Carl? She knows who you are. Yeah. Right, so she already knows. Maybe your angle, your approach. Yeah. And she's an expert. She's just not. Not just some random. No, she works in a museum, a good museum. I said I'd give it a plug. It's a one there. Knights bridge. It's got dinosaurs and that. And it's worth seeing. National museum. Yeah. So it's not sure. He's not sure. This is what happened. Now, what I'll do, I'll tell you as much as I know and then you can fill me in if I'm right or wrong and then at the end of it, we'll get to the bottom of whether we need them or not. Okay. All right. So first of all, the first thing that I found out is that they have 18 knees. That's not exactly possible. They're insects. So they have six legs and a knee is usually the junction between femur and tibia, that sort of classic human knees and every other animal knee. So with six legs you can only have six knees. Could somebody sort of got mistaken for seeing one that was a bit double jointed. I think you're grasping at stroke. All right, well, we might have to come back to that one then. They can hold the breath for 40 minutes. Well, they don't do that because they don't breathe in the same way as us. They breathe through little spiracles holes down their side of the body. So, no, they're not a very apt simile, because the method of breathing is so different. What do you mean? Because insects have a totally different system. They don't have lungs in the way that we do, just breathing through one part of the body. They're actually breathing through every segment of the body all of the time. So even though they've got their mouth shut, they might be able to slide. Nothing to do with breathing. So just so you see, maybe that's where someone's gone wrong. Someone's got hold of one and sort of taped its mouth up or something and got bored after 40 minutes and said, well, we'll call it wrong kind. Thing to do to an insect, even to a cockroach. Yeah, but it's all. Pretty unkind thing to do anything to anything, even a cockroach. Something else I found out they can live for a week without an Ed. Well, that's true if they don't bleep to death in the process. But the weird thing is, when I told you that they had 18 knees, you seemed a bit sort of like, don't. Don't talk ridiculous. But then we're talking about an animal that can live without an Ed. So. So there's a little bit of truth in that one. Yeah. Yes. Why, when it was invented, as it got that facility, say, if someone said to humans, we could do that with humans, and, you know, if you lose your head in some accident, it gives you a bit of time to sort of go back to your family and maybe write them a note. You won't be able to have a chat, but write them a note saying, it was my own fault and it was nice knowing you. Well, that would be a useful facility, I agree, but cockroaches are great survivors. I mean, they've been around for over 300 million years. They're one of the most primitive insects. All right, well, I've also. Is it true that they do a lot of resting? Apparently they can sort of rest for 75% of the time. Rest? Yeah, they just. Just set about doing nothing. It's probably true of a vast proportion of the world's fauna. I mean, maybe. Maybe the 25% that they are working. They're really giving it some, so it might make. Considerably. You can chill into insects in the fridge and they'll become very, very quiet. You might think they're dead. Yeah. But I'm sure, you know, if we were sat in a fridge, you know, we'd go a bit quiet, won't we? You know? Well, you might not know much about it, of course. Yeah. Not quite reading the right sources. Well, I've been using the Internet. I'm sure there are many useful sources that you could find there, but some of those seem to have been a little misleading to you. So you don't agree with a lot of what I've told you there? No. So, cockroaches. Can we get rid of them? No. So we're keeping them, then? I would say so, yes. I think we should get her on more often because she sounds like she'd be a bit of an ally, really. Because she knew immediately you were talking nonsense. She even said, I think you should be more concerned about your sources, which I've been trying to tell you for a year. Right. The fat. I mean, 18 knees. Where did you get that from? They can hold their breath for 40 minutes. I mean, I don't know what. I don't know what you read and. Take on mud world on it. Right. The cure, obviously. Yes. Right. Carl's been taking phone calls for these clues. Right? And so everyone's been saying the same thing. For the last one. He's been going, no, no. And I'm worried. I'm always worried. Fd. I just overheard him on a call. They're going, ah, what have I been saying? Oh, no, it's fP, dickhead. Well, give me the clues that it's a rollover. I tell people that's we're really sorry to anyone who would have got that. Right. Okay. Right. Do the clues quickly. Tell them where there'd be a rollover. So we have to do three new ones. Do you not write these down? I don't write the answers down in case Ricky looks over the thing and sees the answer. Why would I cheat? I'd rather you do something right with your life. Right. Well, the clues were, I've got three other jumpers like this one. Yeah. Was Ft. Yeah. You got that? Four tops. Yeah, that's all right. Good. Well done. That bunch of people can't make up their minds if they'd want to sit in the sun or not. That was c. They were getting that. That was Charlatans. Charlatan. Right. A bunch of them charlatans. Right. What do you think? What's. Charlie. No, no. It's like, shall I go out? Shall we? Charla. Charlotte hands. They got it right where I went wrong with this one. The jamaican fella, he had to have some aspirin. Why it my fault? You know, I'm not. I'm not. There's no point passing the book or anything I said FD. A lot of people were saying Fred Durst, like for Ed Hurts, which is a good thing. Yeah. Which would have been as good as. Any of yours, but I made an error. So we'll roll it over. No. What is the answer? Jamaican fella. What? Add some aspirin. Why do that? What's that? What's the thing? Fp. Fp. It was freed up a freedom. Free. The pain. Freed up in freedom. That's awful. You've got to write these down next, right. You're the producer. I know, I know, but I've had a busy week. I'm doing such an excuse. That isn't an excuse. Our excuse is we don't. We have. We don't care. Yeah, you do work in and then make a mistake. Yeah. I mean, it's better not to try. Then try your hardest and be rubbish. Do you see what the point we've got? We don't care. But you've got standards. Yeah. And you're not meeting your foot. Think of that. You're not even reaching your standards. God. Right. Well, that's that, I guess. With the prizes. We'll be giving those away next week. Again, just completely song for the ladies. To end the show with. It's from Nick Cave's new album, Noctorama. This is a track called he wants you back next week. Remember Frieda Pain?",
