And all the record. Specifically, what sort of stuff have you planned for us? Because I know you've been working on what you know. You know I've been busy this week. I've been house hunting up various things. But I know you've had the whole week off, right? So what have you been up to? Carl? Tell them what we've got. Tell them what you've. What we've planned. All the stuff you've done. Done? What have you got? But Rick, specifically, what have you come up with? Quick, quickly, get bored. Tell us. I've come up with the music. Right. Obviously that's. We've already planned that. We planned that last week, so that's all done. But what have you yourself contributed to today? Shall I got a text message today from Ross Noble. You know Ross Noble, the comedian who's on it was on. I've got news for you, right? He says, ask Carl if he woke up with ladies boobs, would he just put a dress on and live as a lady? Or would he just be a man, but with his boobs? Carl, it's a good question. I know, I know. That happened to Ross. So he's throwing that one out. It didn't away because he ate pizzas for a year, didn't he did, yeah, he's got a lovely pair of breasts. It's gone boobs. Just find a loose fitting jumper. Go to the doctors. What would you say to the doctor? How would you explain this phenomenon to the doctor? So you'd be. You'd be happy with this because you believe in shite like happen, but it. Can happen because I told you a couple of weeks ago. Can happen. Well, you can wake up with breasts if you're a fella. I told you. Go on. Haven't you remembered? No, I. Funny that in it. Go on. Have you, Steve? No, I don't remember this. What did you tell us on air? Yeah, it can happen if you go to Argentina and have a steak. You can wake up with breasts because. Because I'm sure I remember. Pull the other one. Look, he likes that. He likes that. Is that what you've come up with? Brilliant. Play record. It's gonna be a dynamite show. Listen, look, we're gonna play. I'm gonna play some classic tunes today. I'm gonna educate the youngsters. Steve, right now you've all heard of Lou Reed, you all underground, but you know. Have you heard of Venus in Furze, Carl? Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather. Venus in furs underground. What a great start. Classic. They continue to sound fresh. What that song's about, Carl? No, M and S. M and S. It's about Ms. You know that. Yeah. You know the shop. Yeah. It's all about that. Yeah. Whiplash, my own. All that. All the things you can get at Marks and Spencer. Shiny boots of leather. Yeah. Being whipped. Yeah. I think that's a new division they've opened. Yeah. But we have got a great show lined up, man. We know we have. No, no, because we got rockbusters coming up, the great news that's made the press. Frimley Tea Rooms newsletter mentioned it. We've also got Carl's local, isn't it? Yeah. We've also got educating Ricky. Where Carl educates me. The one last week, a girl, right, she was deaf and she's had an argument with her mum and she pushed her and she hit her head and then she can hear again. Yeah. Don't know what I learned from that. No. It might be. It might be subliminal. Someone might be going. It might. It might be a metaphor that I will learn from. Yeah. It's like a parable. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, look at his face. We might. We might as well be talking Dutch. Why don't we call, say something quick. Is radio. I don't understand what you want from me. Oh, we're only joking. Right, so, educating Ricky, I've worked a bit harder this week. We've got some good stuff. Okay, I'll give you the. The teaser headlines later lines in a bit. Yeah. Well, you've got, you've got rockbusters as well. Having a bit of a stressful week because he thinks he's not appreciated because he's getting at what times you get in about eight or nine, don't you? Well, yeah, I've been busy this week. I've been in at about past eight in the morning. Yeah. And been leaving when? About 08:30. 09:00 at night? Yeah. You in Saturday? Yeah, I'm in now. You get paid, don't you? I'm busy at home. A lot of people work late, Carl. A lot of people work twelve hour days. Why are you busy at home, Kyle? What you up to? Because we try to sort out a move. Uh huh. I've been trying to call around this morning to get someone to buy a food on a table from me. Yes, well, we could put that appeal out now, can we? If anyone wants to buy a futon. Or a table, just think futon that Carl Pilkington slept on. How much you. You asking? Whatever well, you need, you've got to take the two. I don't want, like, different people coming round and that. Sure. Wasting my futon on the table. It's quite specific, isn't it? Someone has to want a futon. Teas made, isn't it? Alarm clock and tea maker. This is futon and table. Looking for about 100 quid. And it's good. It's good condition, the food on. Yeah. Right. You haven't pissed yourself in the. No, no, nothing. And what a table. What sort of table is. Are we talking. Are we talking like a table for a lounge at a dining table? No, for like a computer and just, you know, something. Has you got any drawers? There's no drawers. It's just a nice wooden table. Right. Is it kind of oak or is it sort of an ikea sort of thing? No, it's like oakish. It's okish. Yeah. Okay, so undergrad, the food one is just. It was just. Just a mattress and the pallets. Yeah. Yeah, but it's not. You see, you get cheap futon. This is a good one. It's. How much would that retail for when you purchase? Paid about 250 for. Right. So it's a bargain. Well, if you look at it, if you. How long have you had it? How old is a whole new strategy? Well, I think it's legal. I think. I don't think we should tell you. What I'm interested in. In Rick is just. Just finding out a little bit about the sort of thing that Carl's got in his home. You know, I'm interested in if people will phone up to spend a hundred pounds just to go round. I won't be. No. What? No, they've come here. I'll bring it to work and they can pick up air. I'm gonna bring a futon and a table to work. Don't you write a post on. We need someone with a van now. So we need is anyone who wants. But they're not around your house. Can they meet you next door? Someone with a van? Could they meet you in your street somewhere? Hold on. Could they meet. What were the little chinese fellow that lives across the road on the two bouncers and the old woman who's dead reading a book. Could you meet him somewhere? I've got an idea. What about if you meet the end of your street, you blindfold them like they do when. When terrorists take the negotiator to the hideout. Big cheese. And so you could say that. And so, you know, they could piece together maybe where you live from, the sands and stuff. Yeah, yeah. But what about that, Carla? That seems a great idea. And would you sign the futon for people, do you think? Would you give him a little signature or maybe at least a bit of purchase? You could sign the pallet. Yeah. Or I could try and get work to buy it off me and then we give it away for rockbusters. Would you do that, do you think? They do? I think probably do it for Foxy with his. With his big. Imagine how big that. Imagine if he wanted to sell his hog. Yeah. That is a motorbike, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. He's been selling his hog for money for years, hasn't he? Oh, dear. So we'll see about that. So if people are interested, maybe email Ricky Gervais fm dot co dot uk if you're interested in futon. Buy Carl's futon competition. 100 pounds o n o. Yeah, yeah. I never knew what that meant. Oh, I know. I thought it went sort of on news. On news. Well, we got. Well, tell me what we got to give away, Steve. So, actually, I have to say, you've excelled yourself this week. Every Nashcroft's single coming up soon after this. Go on. When have you. Since when have you taken to talking like that? It does amuse me. Go on. This is actually. This is a nice little collection here. This is a three DVD set. David Attenborough's the life of birds, trials of life and life in the freezer. That's a good one, isn't it? That's a selection of animal based documentaries we've got. And I think what it's based at. Well, absolutely. When he goes off the ball and does like fast cars. This is very, very good indeed. This is a best of David Bowie complex. A very good. Not the rubbish ones that no one else wanted. This is a brilliant complexion on there. We've got this now. This looks like a madness. Oh, no, no, no. It's far worse than we could possibly have imagined. It seems to be some kind. Is it? Tie in with the our house madness musical. And it's not a cast of 20 people who wanted to be singers. It's tricky to find out. I can't figure out if it's the originals or not. But needless to say, if you're a madness fan, I'm sure that'd be an absolute. You love that. Now, I know that, Steve. I wouldn't mind that DVD collection myself. The giveaways that. No, we can't. I'm talking of great compilations. What about this? It's country legends. I'm sitting on the front there. Glenn Campbell. We've got Doddy Parton. We've got, what should we call it on the, on the car. What do you call it from? Great performer. Yeah. Jake, what? You, mcCall it. Oh, excellent. Great hits from him. So that's there as well. That's same XFM compilation again. Easy to get hold of. The big one. The big one, the film that Carl picks every week. The DVD movie this week. Don't go out tonight if you've got a DVD player and a television set because you'll be staying in and watching this fantastic film. It will tear your soul apart. It's Hellraiser, the original Hellraiser. Bear in mind, it has been on channel four and channel five and on most cable channels since it came out. But if you haven't seen, if you're one of the only people who has not seen it, and of course you have to be over 18 to play, then you can win Hellraiser. That is fantastic. Well, play a song, car and we'll come back to that. More great stuff indeed. The competition comes up later. Email only, isn't it, Karl? Yeah, absolutely. Futon. Futon. Still available. Richard Ashcroft. Check the meaning. Well, Carl, you're chuffed, aren't you? What's happened? What's just happened? Tell the listeners what's happening. This is sparked up a bit. Steve's just called up. He's putting an offer for the food on and the table. Yeah, I think he wanted, he definitely wanted it. But I said, look, you know, think about over the weekend. Yeah. You're not a hustler. No, I'm not. I'm not going to rush him into it because once he's got it, he can't bring it back. I'm not messing about. No. So bloke said, what sort of wood is it? Carl said, sort of, sort of like a light brown color. He went, what beach? Colored? Car went, depends what beach you're on. Which was nice. You do understand there's a wood that's called beach. Well, he's happy. He likes the sound of it. Nice plum cover. Yeah. It's Carl going, that'll go with magnolia. You also might just go, I'll tell you what, license looked nice in your spare bedroom. It was like what he did, the changing rooms. It was like listening to an episode of Carl. He did the deal in under three minutes, was it? He phoned it about halfway through in that song. So, yeah. You work pretty quick, Carl, I gotta say. Germanx galley works. Are you sure we're not allowed to do this, though? No, I think it's highly criminal. Have you got anything? Well, I'll tell you, I am moving. Shortly, so, I mean, I might. I might come in next week. I could have a couple of. I threw away a desk the other day. I gotta get rid of a bed, a chair. Cause, you know, I'm pretty tall. This is so pathetic. When I moved up to London, my dad said, well, you wanna be careful. Cause I mean, the seating in a lot of these London pads. Pad. Seeing very low backs. Fashionable, isn't it? Fashionable chairs and stuff. You're a big guy, six foot seven, you need like a decent chair. We went to a shop, it was like a second hand furniture, right? I bought this chair, very high back, so I could sit in my room and watch tv. But was it a soft chair or was it a wooden chair? It was kind of like a sort of. It was. Well, let me explain, because it's kind of like an armchair, but it's kind of got wooden arms. So I get this show, bring up to London. This is a great chair. This is a wonderful chair. I'm watching tv. Everyone else is agony chair, right? And I thought someone went. They looked at it, they went, isn't that an orthopedic chair? And I looked it again, right? And I realized it's kind of white, cleanable. It's made of some kind of fabric. Allowed you to just mop it down with a wet cloth. Because I think it came from an old people's home. You know when you see like old people in some kind of social room in an old people's home, just sat watching a little tv and they can. You can wipe everything clean. It was. It's one of those chairs. Oh, that's fantastic. So if anyone's. Maybe they've got an elderly slipping off. And it's also the most uncomfortable chair because unless you've got chronic back pain, it just is the most uncomfortable chair. It makes you sit bolt upright, if not slightly forward. You've done a good set on it. I think the phones are going mental. If you've had a recent accident or you've got a disabled or someone in the house who's just elderly, then you might want to get in touch. I'm happy you can turn off man for 25 quid. This is so wrong. 25 quid. I'll take that. Maybe you're setting up an old people's home. You know, it's a little project. Yeah. You don't get a lot of grant and we can out. Exactly. I mean. And because, though Steve's such a high flyer, I mean, if it really is a good cause, they just give it to you. Well, let's not rush into anything, really. I like to assess each case. Certainly, if you are a charity, then I might go for 20 quid. You take off my hands with 20 quid. But otherwise, 25. And I tell you, it's in good condition because I haven't really signed quid off. If you really. And there were some stains, I've wiped them clean. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, that's fantastic. So we've. I'll tell you what, we should. We should resuscitate next week, swap shop. The multi color. Honestly, there's a great format, but there's a couple of things I've always wanted to get my house. Swap shop is one of them and the other one is superstars. I don't remember superstars. Superstars was great because it was, like the people of their time. So you'd have, like, people, like, nowadays, you'd have. You'd have Beckham and what's his name. Who's the tennis player? Rozett's key. Yeah. And they have to compete. So all these people have to compete at each other's sports. Now, choose seven out of ten sports. And there's a leaderboard and there's a big final. Oh. Oh. Keegan came off his bike. No, no, it's real sports, proper sports. It's 100 meters, tennis, weightlifting, all the real sports. You. You can't do your own sport. Well, I know you're a pretty big guy now in british tv. You're a bit of a big shot. What do you reckon? Pull some strings. Let's get it. Stars. Superstars. Sounds fantastic. Johnny Vegas, Peter K for the bigger fella. I think maybe the comedy. Comedy superstars. What we got next? We've got a bit of Springsteen, haven't we? Let's play Springsteen. This is a track from his current album, the rising. A lot of people throw. Bruce is a bit mor. A bit middle of the road or whatever, but, you know, I just think, piss off. Yeah. I just think, screw you. Yeah, get lost. Yeah. Imagine this. Your open top caddy. Yeah. Route 66. You just. You're going home, maybe to thanksgiving. Yeah. See your folks. Just turn up the radio if you. Are, play the tune. Probably not that just reminded me when. I brought her, so stop it for a second. Just realized when I brought a woman back and she saw the orthopedic chair. You bring a woman back to your pad. Oh, it's embarrassing. And the harness. Yeah, exactly. The trust. Yeah, yeah. Can you give me those two splints? I'm sorry? Those two splints there. Well, I've got to go. Have you. Is this a potty under the base? Title track from Bruce Springsteen's current. Yes. Good feeling of melancholy and uplifting. We've had quite an interactive show so far because we got a call. The superstars is coming back. It's due to come back in the BBC schedules, which is great news, apparently, was. Steve Redgrave is one of them, I don't think. Well, professional footballs be allowed to take part these days, though, when they aren't 50 grand a week. You can't really have them falling off bikes and their ankles, can you? MacAskill last night. Yeah, I'm slippery fix. Ian mcCaskill. Did you see stubbornly fixed? No, I haven't seen it. There was a great moment where they had to go into a thing called a BoD pod and you sit in. It looks like space age, and it analyzes you and it tells you percentage body fat. Now, I think men are meant to be about sort of 15% to 25% body fat. Women are meant to be about 20 to 30 body fat. And they all went in there and it went in there and it said in Macasco, and it came up 34% body fat or whatever. Slightly overweight. I would have come to the 38% overweight. Then it went the other 145 percent body weight, obese. Then it went. Jono, did it say, I don't want to tell you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then it went 50% body fat. Very obese. Then Rick Waller was sat in there and it came up 60% body fat. And I wanted to come up slug, but it came up more with a 60. You are 60% fat. So 60% of him is fat? Yeah, yeah. 60% of his entire makeup. That's extraordinary. Well, you know, my feelings about. Well, then, let's go on to. Well, that's the reason I don't watch the show, actually. I do feel a bit sorry for him and he. I think he is trying, although the fella there thinks he's not trying, so I don't know who to believe. I don't know. I believe Waller, and he does get pains in that and he is a bit. The problem is. Right, he does like his food. Yeah, we all like our food. But if he didn't do the exercise, he wouldn't be as hungry and he might not get fat. This is a whole new nutritional outlet. Absolutely. So you're saying don't exercise and carry on eating. And that's interesting. Let me write that one down. I will send that to the british nutritional organization. No, that's good. Carl Pilkington. Okay, well, I'm no doctor or anything. Bloody modest. Please. You are a doctor. You're not a doctor. Seriously, you know, you didn't qualify. But that's interesting. He dropped out earlier. That's mad, that is. You're as good as doctor. Just, you just didn't get the paperwork, whatever. You didn't for the exam. He was just saying that Bruce Springsteen depressed him a little bit. Yeah. Because it reminds him of when he worked in the supermarket. And I said, it's funny how cassandra can do that. Take it right back there. He went, yeah, nothing else can do that. I said, well, actually smell is the most evocative sense because smell is linked to memory in the brain. And he went, yeah, they probably said that before music, though. And now all science going, we've got, we better revisit this because there's music now. We've had this theory knocking around for, you know, ten. I want to see Bruce. You'll be pleased. Now I just want the fans of the show to know that I did make it to Bruce Springsteen's concert last week. And he started with that song we just played and it was dynamite. I mean, he never let up. Almost 3 hours. He rocked the joint. He's 53. He was sliding across. It was pure rock and roll. Pumping our fist, sliding across the floor on his knees. He was jumping on the piano. It was real Jerry Lee Lewis rock and roll. And it was dynamite. And I just was looking around, though. And when I am the trendiest person at a gig, oh dear, then I'm in trouble. Do you know what I mean? And there are some of the people there, I imagine, you know, on Amazon.com it says like people who bought x also bought. Yeah. And I think people who bought tickets for Bruce probably bought tickets for Martin offner. Yeah. Dave Gilmore. Yeah. Without employed. But then Nick's. But there's also. Yeah, but then there's also, you know, all the monsters. Right. They probably buy stones when they visit, you know. Yeah, yeah. Probably taste the blue wash jeans. Yeah, yeah. It's the small waistcoats. Yeah. Denim shirt, plaid. Plaid shirt. Maybe sort of like timberlands. Anyone with timberlands. I'm not. That's libelous. Sure. No, sure. Say I've done it again. But it was hell getting out. I couldn't find. I mean, I went to the tube and it was a nightmare because some of the tubes weren't running. I just said, my friend, I'll stop this, you know. Stormed off trying to find a cab. Couldn't find a cab. Wandering around Wembley, just livid. I mean, fuming because I couldn't find a cab. Just. I was screaming because I was going, I've got money, I'm on the radio, I've had a tv show, I've got the cash, I'm willing to spend it. There's no one who can help me get home. I've seen him shout this in Brewer street, just standing in the middle. Go on. And I was thinking to myself, what would you have done there? Because in the end, I just sat in a little calf and something to eat. But you, I mean, if you couldn't get a cab, what would you have done? Just because there's a couple of. I was looking. There's a couple of hotels near Wembley. I was thinking you'd have just checked in. Yeah. And just stayed. So when there's a cab, let me know. I was thinking, because you were thinking of going. Would have booked a cab beforehand. Yeah. Would you have. Would you have thought to do that? Yeah, I'd have got a cab there and I'd have booked a cab when. The helicopter just took you back home. Yeah. Always having a digging. He's having a laugh and he. Yeah, yeah. Play the ads. Dead in Vegas. Scorpio rising, featuring the voice of. Is it Noel? Gary? Liam, innit? Is it Liam? Sounded a bit like him. Liam, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Excellent. Yeah. Right, okay, let's. Let's get this show well and truly on the road. We better start educating Ricky. Next car. What have you got for me? I can't wait for learning. I need learning. I need education. We should just explain, obviously. For those that have just tuned in, Carl tries to teach Ricky three things. Each week based on the pun title and. Yeah, each of them. Each of them just to tantalize Ricky is abbreviated into some kind of headline. Christmas clue involved, involving a pun. So what have you got for us this week? They are really cryptic this week. Okay, yeah. First story, little headline is don't worry about him. He candle it. He candle it. Yeah. Sounds a bit like he can handle it, but it's not brilliant. Second one. Coming soon and stocking. Eight k and waterman go on. Second one. I am committed to this treatment. I'm committed to this treatment. Yeah. All right. Tantalising. Yeah. And the last one, the police are causing a bit of a stare. Can't we get Kyle on telly? There's got to be a way. With all the cable channels, anyone can get on telly these days. Let's get. Let's phone up. Let's get you on choice or summit. Just a little. Just. Carl, what are you going for? He can handle it, I think. Don't worry about him. He candle it. He candle it. Okay, let's hear this one. All right. Are you familiar with the. The phrase burning the candle at both ends? Yeah. Do you know it's come about? I know. I mean, it does. I assumed that it was to get more light in the room. How would that work? Well, they'd put it sideways and light both wicks. So I have one candle they could get. No, no. Go. What it is, it means you stay doing too much, you're staying up too much, you're not getting enough sleep, and you're. All years ago. Yeah. When they didn't have light bulbs and that. Oh, yeah. What year is this? Literally. Literally ages ago. Specifically, yeah. Quite a bit back. Okay. Didn't have light bulbs and that. So they used to have candles. When did light bulb come in? Because I can't remember the moment. What? I don't know. Okay. Gone. So, um. Yeah, so they've kind of light bulb. You're not me. You wouldn't know. You're a doc, you're a doctor, you're not historian. Go on. And people who worked a lot of hours. Yeah. How many? Literally lots. They get up early in the morning because they have to be up early. Yeah. And it's dark outside, so they light the candle. Sure. And they wear it out a bit. And then they'd be getting in late as well. Yeah. And like, they'd be like, oh, it's dark, I'll have to light the candle again. And the burning candle at both ends of the day. So that's where the saying comes from, burning the candle at both ends. So. All right, that's lesson. Lesson. Okay. Can I have. No, you can't. You can't rush into them, Rick, you've got to soak that one in. Any questions for Carl off the back of that? What do you think? So. So people were. I mean, basically where this comes from is people were literally the cat loops. Sure. So we've still got. Go on. I'm committed to this treatment. I can't wait. This is like Christmas special. I've got to open another present now. No, I'm afraid we've got to save it, Rick. Listen, we often get a lot of email correspondence during the show, Rick, which I don't. I don't sort of pass on to you because, I mean, you're busy, you're planning the show and stuff. You've got a lot of ideas, you got music and stuff to worry about. So I checked the emails and we get a lot of response. A lot of people obviously, you know, want to give us feedback. Just a sample one from Richard Anderson. He's just emailed us in here, Rick, because he's been listening to the show. He says, ricky, your show is appalling. Are you actually aware you're on the radio or has someone just secretly stuck a microphone on you? That's from Richard Anderson. That's typical of the kind of feedback, Rick. We're getting. Really good. Is it? So that's. That's the kind of high, positive praise that we're getting. So I'm down listening because I wanted him. Yeah. No, I mean, I was gunning for him as a fan. I was worried early on in our career. So I think he's hooked now, though. But thanks, Anders, for getting in touch. Good work for Hellraiser, though. Any. Yeah, well, that's still the kind of. Come. What we playing? A bit of old dirty bird. I can't. I can't say the word. It's offensive. Old, is it? Old dirty bollocks. No, no, no. What is it? Old dirty. Oh, dirty. Big cocktail breaks up. Brilliant. Yeah, yeah. Funny words are there. Although XfM's a funny word. I just say the letters out because the word doesn't make sense. Just let me just check Richard Anderson's email again. Just remind myself of. Go on, Ricky. Your show is appalling, Richard Anderson. Thanks. What I like about Dicky Dicky Anders is that he's obviously so angry, so annoyed by the show that he's bothered to email just to get the venom out in other ways. You just think you'd switch over. He's obviously so annoyed. He knows how to hurt someone. Exactly. He's really taking the time out design. Thing to show his disapproval of giving up. It is pretty hard to listen to. What, this? Yeah, I've listened back to the tape, that one. When you're making that thing for the best of. Yeah. And I. I mean, I sounded like Albert Tatlock. I really sounded like some sort of punch drunk stroke victim and oh, there you go. I don't remember myself like that. So, yeah, I do apologize. It's. It's not a great planned show. Slick word of articulate. But I mean, then who is? But I think there's so many shows that are, you know, nowadays on radio, I think there's a lot of stuff that's heavily formatted, you know, and there's with, you know, other presenters who were professional and got some sort of degree of talent. Yeah. And ability to sort of string sentences, you know, I'm thinking Chris Moyles. Yeah, but I mean, I'm bored with those, you know. I think we need a little bit of. Little bit of car. Hey. In our life. Just thinking, actually, I just suddenly struck me, if you want to get rid of your, your furniture. Got a buyer. You've already got a buyer. Because if there's any other stuff. What? I. We. We were clearing some stuff out of our place recently and we just dumped some stuff outside on the street because we were going to take it and take it to the tip later. Just dump some stuff outside. And I have never seen so many people come out of the woodwork scavenging through our garbage. It was incredible. Like zombies. Well, that's what I was saying. Flies own. When I said to Carl, that's what. You just do, just dump it. When he was. It'll get taken. When he went, he said, do you think I asked enough, Andrew? I went, yes, definitely. He went, oh, I could ask what? I said, no, don't do that. I said, because you'll end up having to pay the council. Take it away. Said, I wouldn't. He said, I'd rather just dump it in that little homeless fellow outfit. And then he went. In, right? I walked past this, sat outside hearts, right? A little 24 hours shop. He sat outside there and he goes, have you got any change? And they go, I can do better than that. Yeah, here's a chair and table. It is a futon. Yeah. A futon, no less. Not your boring bed, but a trendy. Yeah, well. But the thing is, I am amazing. The number of people that would stop to look at our junk. What? There was a car driving by with a family and kids, perfectly respectable. Just driving past, you know, on the way to somewhere. Stopped, got out, got the kids out the car. Come on, kids, let's just look through this junk. But I like the idea we were. Going to Walton Towers, dad. No, no, sorry, no time. We're not going to the zoo. Let's look through this rubbish. We're not going look at people's rubbish. Put his gloves on. Look through this shit. Ow. That's an eater. It was. I mean, who does that? It was like a Saturday afternoon. Kids were just going to go and look through some rubbish. And one guy, this is the most incredible. One guy. I caught him going through the bins as I came in. I said, all right, what you doing? He was one of those homeless guys who likes to remain dignified. Why did you say, what are you doing? Well, because it was my house. I had to go part. I had to squeeze my. He wasn't in your kitchen. He was in our front garden. Oh, was he? Yeah, going through. He'd torn the bags open. He was going through it. I said to him, what you're up to? He went, oh, yeah, just looking. Don't worry, I'll clean it all up afterwards. Just looking for a few odds and ends. I said, oh, well, you can take what you want, you know. It's all going away. Thanks very much. Thanks. So we went off. I didn't think anything of it. I was walking past the shops the following days, a little sort of, kind of 711, right? I was walking past, I thought, oh, that's interesting. A Gill Scott Heron album for sale. And I looked and I thought, wait a minute. This is all our rubbish. And the guy had set up, like, a little car boot sale outside the 711 on the pavement. He'd taken adjunct. He'd marked on prices. There's, like, an old RAC book from 1976 that had been lying in the house. A yellow pages, you know, and he marked up the prices. Yellow pages. So I'm glad you were. What year was 50 p? I snapped it up, and it was incredible. He had the cheek of just selling our junk outside. Enterprise car. You. Could you do that? What do you used to do? You used to sell flowers? Sold flowers. I sold, uh. Sold fizzy drinks at school. Did, yeah. Yeah. You made what? Sodastream? Yeah, yeah. Made some, uh. Well, of course, when you were doing your pilkies making music, your disco. Yeah. You used to go into Mum's bedroom and could find a pair of tights and a cigar here. They. Yeah, they'd be prizes. Did your dad used to smoke cigars in tights or. Or your mom? Which one of them? He's just gone. Let's. Let's, uh. Yeah, we're educating Ricky. No, no, no. That's teasing that rockbusters. Well, I think we should play a tune. Come back with rockbusters. The show's fallen down. And we were going so well, and that. It's just the energy, isn't it? The first hour we got through, I'm. Still in good spirits. Is this still good, is it? This showing it? Yeah, yeah, it's still good, is it? I'll just, let me just check because. Just check what Richard Anderson thinks. Good evening. He thinks it's appalling. No, the dixter thinks it's appalling. So we should pay attuned that of aqualung. Aqua lung. Aqua lung. Rockbusters next. I like that. That's great in it. Good times gonna come. Well, Carl, we've got loads of ideas. We've got emails coming left, right, center. I think you've caused quite a stir. I think you've turned this show around, to be honest. I'm being honestly. Yeah, no, you've done really well. You're actually acting a bit like a producer, isn't he? And you're coming through in your own right. We had great suggested. We've had a great email. Let me just check. This is from Jeff Dunn. He's a big fan of the show and he's just had a genius idea. He's saying you're moving house. Carl, why don't Ricky and I come round? We can do a live outside broadcast from your flat. We can observe from your kitchen those weirdos that live opposite. We can just maybe just wander around, just see the kind of place that you've got, you know, see, maybe check out your record collection, your clothes, what you got in the bathroom. It'd be amazing. It'd be like Louis Theroux, wouldn't it? We'll be Louis Theroux. Come on, Carl, this is a dynamite idea. Nah. Why? I don't want you coming around making a mess on that. When have I ever made a mess in the studio? Yeah, exactly. No, do you know what I mean? We're not going to make a mess. We're not going to have anything with us. But what's in it for anyone? Well, it's just a fascinating insight into. You, but right when I see that little chinese kid across the road who's dancing about in his underpants, that's in the evening, right? He's not going to be doing that on a Saturday, so you'll be disappointed there. Sure. You could show us the movie which. He dances, we say little chinese kid. He's a 35 year old man, isn't he? Yeah. You know, anyway, that, that's beside the. Point, you know, we'll find our own amusement. No, I don't. I know the woman downstairs has got a baby. And if we make loads of noise. And it's that gets noise, are we just gonna have a conversation in your flat? Have a cup of tea? Yeah, but if we do an Ob, we need to get like a car outside with a big aerial on it and the Parkins bad round our way. What do you mean you have to do it? What do you mean to do outside broadcast. They put in an ISDN line just for the day. So make a mess of the wall and I won't get my deposit back. We'll leave that. You know, he's going around painting all the little holes to get his deposit back in the wall. He wants to get his deposit back. He's probably costing about 400 quid redecorating. Let's remind people, Carl, of the. The prizes for Rockbusters this week. It's dynamite stuff. We've got the David Attenborough DVD nature collection. We've got a number of CDs, the best of David Bowie. We've got a madness CD. Not quite sure whether that's songs from the musical or. Or their original tunes. Country legends. Two CDs there of great country music and the remix to XFM compilation. Plus, of course, the big movie prize this week. If you haven't seen it already, then I assume you have never seen a film before. There's anyone who hasn't seen Hellraiser, but obviously you have to be above 18 to join. How long would you want to be round for? Is this just for the. Just for the show? Couple of hours. 2 hours. Just get the desk in there and live Ob. We could check out the futon. We could sing it the following night. Yeah. Sold that by. We could have someone come around and buy it live on here. Yeah, yeah. Think about it, think about it, think about it. How did Graceland start? That was his normal house. And then it took over. Yeah, right. Anyway, rockbusters. Yeah. I give a cryptic clue. Yeah. And. And a letter and it makes up a band. He never said the word cryptic a few months ago. I love it. I mean, I feel it's like our own little Eliza Doolittle. Yes. Even Richard will like this one. Here we go then. First one. There's three of them going. You email in. If this doesn't turn dicky round, nothing will. This is an email only competition. Email only. Right. Here's the first one. Initial is b. So it's a band starting with B. Okay. And the cryptic clue is. I don't like them birds. They shouldn't be allowed in this area. I don't like them birds. They shouldn't be allowed in this area. Next one. Right, the next one. He doesn't like women yet. He's got a couple of kids. That's a bit weird. Is that just a general point is. That'S the cryptic clue. Okay? And the initials there are PD. Okay? And, uh, the last one. Uh, I've got that one. That's terrible. That's terrible. Okay, quickly. Oh, God. And the last one is, uh. Oh, that blokey does. Come on. It's making me laugh. Come on, Kong, be professional. Right? I can't do it. It's making me laugh. Oh, come on. I'll come and read them. No, no. Come on, Karl. They don't do this on blockbusters on tv, do they? No. Come on. That bloke who does sport on telly, he's got a little kid, right? Initials DC. Is that the clue? Yeah. That bloke who does spot on telly. Yeah? He's got a little kid. Initials DC. Okay, is that a band or I'm a cheese sandwich. Is it. What is it? Is it a band or an eye? So just quickly recap, okay? Come on, Khan. Right? Come on. Quick, quick recap. The first one is b. I don't think them birds should be around in this area. Right? That's b. Right? Second one, he doesn't like women yet. He's got a few kids. It's a bit weird. That's PD. And the final one, that bloke who does sport on the telly, he's got a little kid, right? DC. All right? And it's Ricky GervaisFm co dot uk. If you want to enter for Hellraiser. I tell you, continue to that little theme of, like, some old stuff people haven't heard of. The under 30. Probably never heard of this band. It's also a new thing I want to introduce. It's. It's show up Canfield. Campfield talks the talk. He doesn't walk the walk. He doesn't play some rock classics on his show because he's scared. I'm going to play the tracks that can feel too scared to play. This is Kansas and carry on your way with son. All right, Nirvana. Amazing. We're just talking. We're getting excited. Yeah, we've got an incredible voice. Yes. Growl drumming. It's brilliant. You know, you're right. New one from Nirvana. Well, it's time for educating Ricky part two, isn't it? I'm excited, Carl. I'm gonna learn so much from this. What's the choice again. What you've got left. Still. Still keep. Phone in. Your answers to email. Email. Sorry, yeah. The answers to rock buses. Okay. Educating Ricky, part two. Right. I'm committed to this treatment. Yeah. Is that one. Yeah, yeah. Or the other one is the police are causing a bit of a stare. He still says it like it's the best thing he's ever come up with. Which way is it? Could be. Right, go on in. I'm committed to this treatment. Right. Do you know the saying? Is it just sayings now? Are they all sayings, this? No, no. No, they're not. Okay. The other one isn't frog in your throat. The saying there's a frog in your throat? Yeah. I assume it's when you croak a little bit, it sounds. No. All right. Might seem a bit weird, this one. Right. But years ago. Oh, yeah. So what is that clue? Committed to this treatment. It's about frogs. Committed. Probably works better with a K and an ER written down. Well, also if you'd pronounced it kermitted. Yeah. For not committed to this treatment. Right, go on, then. That's genius. So, yeah. What you get, you go to the doctors and you go, throat. Certain? A bit. Right. And what they did ages ago. Ages ago. What year was this, approximately? We are going back quite a bit with this one. Okay, go on. And the doctor would say. Imagine years ago. Go on. The doctor would say, right, keep you. Keep your mouth open. I need to look at your tonsils. And the jaw would ache a bit because. Because they weren't as quick back then, because they didn't have the technology and stuff. And they don't, like, stare at it and study it and stuff. I'm like, you get an achy jaw. Right? Keeping their mouth open. Yeah. Like you get. So it's up there and these always close the mouth. And it used to annoy the doctor. So what they did, they used to get a toad, right? And put it in the mouth. Rubbish. Okay, keep rubbish. Keep talking, keep talking. And that way they couldn't close the mouth because either did squash it, right, or apparently you're not allowed to lick a toad's back. So the doctor would have them for breaking the law. No, no, no. But it's poisonous. All right? A toad's back. You should never lick a toad's back. Or put it in your mouth. Really. Just stopped. One question. I've got a few, but no, sure. My initial thought is it sounds like a brilliant bit of sort of medical knowledge there. It's a great idea. Yeah. My only thought is, how does the doctor see past the toad? Yeah. What's he actually looking at with a mouth open? Surely the toad is. Is around in the way. It didn't say. Sorry, my question, my first question is, was this on the Internet? Yeah, yeah. Okay, Carl, that is bollocks. That is. I mean. Well, all right then, let's turn this round. Where does the saying you've got a frog in your throat? Come on. Probably because you sound a bit croaky. Probably that. Probably because you sound a little bit like a frog when you've got a sore throat. Carl, did you not question it just for a moment when you read it, just for a second, didn't you think that seems an odd approach? Firstly, why a frog? Of all the difficulties, poisonous is poisonous. Well, yeah, well, that. It worked. I'm committed words. No, I was going to change it to, have you heard the news? Toad day. Right. So. So that's rubbish. So that's rubbish. Next, can I have. Let's play a tune. Let's come up with a. Oh, can I just say. No, just play, just play. Yeah. Yo, Col. I have to thank my mate Dave, who sent me an incredible four disc compilation. That was one of the tunes on there. It's incredible. Oh, he's gone to too much effort. Ben Queller, it's a track called, in other words, from his album Shah, shah, open wide. Oh, yeah, that's interesting. Oh, you've actually got a frog in your throat. I didn't get there, I put it in there. That's the most ludicrous story I've ever heard. Carl, why don't you think when you read these things. I think there's always going to be a better truth in all of these. I mean, that fella called up, didn't he, and said, he said, I'm not sure about the, you know, putting a frog in your throat if you've got, you know, problems with your tonsils or whatever. But he said years ago, if someone had toothache. Yeah. Did get hold of a frog and strap it to the face. Yeah, sure. So maybe down the line, you know, maybe they did, maybe. What is Emperor? A horse and emperor as well, but I mean, you know, doesn't go on. Dick Anderson's been back in time. Excellent. I think so we've turned him out now. He says, ricky, thanks for a really forgettable 2 hours of radio. I think I'll spend the time next week counting my feet. That's from Richard Anderson. So we turned him around. No, the phrase counting my feet comes from. Well, in the olden days, right. I'm talking ages ago, when you really loved something. Yeah. He used as a. As a sign of respect, like, say, a radio show, you'd count your feet, and that's where that comes from. Well, what about the frog thing with a poisonous back? It's rubbish. That's true. No, the toadoes have the secretions in there. Why? Why they didn't put it in people's mouths. No. So, well, I'll tell you why. When a badger or a heron tastes the toad, it's horrible. Yeah. The toad might die, but it's for the good of the species, because then think how many toads, like, looking like that heron, could eat in its lifetime. So the fact that one toad sacrifice of all those other toads in that heron's manner will be sad. Why? I mean, you know, we've talked about animals a lot show. Right? Yeah. And when God made a toad. Sure. Right, okay, well, stop you there. I'm gonna stop you there straight away. Don't just let him carry on. Right. There's annoying things out there. You know, jellyfish is a big problem with me. I don't understand why. What they do in the sea and stuff. Right, all right. But we will leave them. We won't. We won't talk about jellyfish with the toad. Right. If it's to protect itself. Yeah. Right. Now it's a protective species. Yeah. But that's surely right. If the toad had a choice, if God said, right, what I'm going to do for you here, you can have something like a lobster's got claws, be claws to have a fight. Or I can give you something that if someone's having a go at you, you've got to try and persuade them to lick you back as a defense. Yeah. What use is like. Oh, God. Well, I tell you why. What is God? The fact that there are still toads around is a testament to that defense working. That's all I'm going to say. Okay. If the toad had died out, you'd have a point. But they're still around. It works. All right. And don't start slagging God off. He's got a lot on his plate. I mean, basically, I think he took on too much, particularly one week. Exactly. It was crazy. Danger. High voltage electric six, XFM 104.9. I'm making gervaise with me, Steve Merchant. Carl's getting all flustered because I put elastic band around his head and we've had a definition of. Well, hang on a second. Because there's an update to that. We did just have one definition here of a frog in the throat. Apparently this has come from some Internet site, so who knows how convincing it is? But it says frog in the throat, meaning suffering from temporary hoarseness, needing to clear the throat. Origin from the old english frogger, meaning hoarseness. That's from Chris. Now, that sounds slightly suspect to me, but frogger, I mean, it seems odd that it would derive from that when it's so clearly appears to be. You sound like a frog when you have a sore throat. Yeah, but the word frog can come from frogger because it sounds like. It sounds. Wasn't frog a game you could play on the frog? But listen, hang on, there's an update to that because just to the common frog, of course. Rana temporara. That's the latin name. Well, your toad is buffo. Buffo. You may be trying to show off, but I think you're about to embarrass yourself as well because you've been slagging off young Carl. It says here another email. It doesn't tell us who it's from, although it's hard to believe. Now, at one time, medieval physicians believed that the secretions of a frog could cure a cough if they were coated on the throat of the patient. That in itself sounds repulsive, but what makes the idea even worse is the application of the secretions. Instead of painting the treatment on something which may also have seemed rational, a live frog was placed into the mouth of the sufferer, where it remained until the physician decided that the treatment was complete. Apparently, Shakespeare's son in law. That's a question. I don't know what that means. Anyway, it's no wonder that today a froggy or croaky attempt at speech is said to be a frog in your throat. You can see that what's happened there is Carl's misread, or been slightly misinformed about a medieval practice. In a sense, you're both winners just for taking part. What's your final one, Carl? The final story is the police are causing a bit of a stare. I can't wait. It's about this fella. I think it's in England somewhere. Don't know when it happened. Literally, ages ago, basically. Well, I think it's when they were trying to crack down on drunken people walking about in the street. All right, and they found this Saturday that way, and found this fella and all the local people were saying, oh, look at him wandering around, he's drunk and what have you. That's not right. Get the police in. He got arrested and that, and they got him in the court and the judge was there and he says, so, you know, what's all this? What's going on? What you doing wandering about when you've had a drink? You know the rules. You shouldn't be doing that. You had a glazed expression on your face, blah, blah, blah. What do you have to say for yourself? He only had a glass eye. So you have two glass eyes. I have one, but that was about to sort of lock him up. Was he was. He was pretty livid. But was he also drunk with a glass eye? No. No, that's the weird thing. He wasn't even had a drink, so. I just thought because he had a. Weird stairs, because his eyes were all glazed. Yeah. Well, where'd you get this from? Why are you telling me this? Why are you telling me this? I don't. I don't. I mean. Thank you. Because it's, you know, killed a couple of minutes. But why is this educating me? What are you. What are you telling me here? There's a bit of a thing there, a bit of a fable that don't always judge a book by its cover. Yeah, so the guy, he hadn't even had a drink. He'd probably just been shopping. Yeah. Walking down the street and everyone's, like, getting involved, like, what's he doing? Hang on. I don't understand. He's walking down the street, happens to have a glass eye. He was doing nothing else to suggest he was drunk. You don't pick people up just because they. Their eye looks like. But even if it happens, why are you telling me with. No. With no particular detail. I know this. But then we're gonna get enough information. I know. Yeah. No, there's a bit of a lesson there, educating Ricky. Just, you know, just watch what you say. Don't always jump to conclusions. The only education I could take from that is that if I ever do become a policeman, I shouldn't just arrest people because they look a bit drunk. I should just tap their eye with a pen. Oh, on you go. Yeah. Guys, can I just. Look, I'm just gonna email Richard Anderson and tell him I agree. Right, listen. Running out of time. And where did the phrase frog in. The throat come from? God, we've got it here. He's been. He's been told we play a tune and come out with that lined up. Yeah, we've got the song with the story in it. Come on, let's do some. A quick play record song with a story in it. They're listening. We discussed this off air. Come on, play record. Right. It's a song with a good story in it. You got to listen to the words. Carl, what was that? That was your little song with the story. That's another little feature that we do every Saturday, so make sure you tune in. It's a song that's got a good story. And it's a lot of music about these. I don't know what they're going on about. Where's that classic from the kinks called lola? Yeah. What's it about? I'd listen to it for the first time properly this morning. Yeah. And what I've worked out from is there's a fellow who goes out for a normal Saturday night out is in Soho. Yeah. He's having a seven, a Coca Cola or whatever. And he sees. He sees this woman, she's alright, man, a bit of that. So he wanders over and he sort of gets talking to. He looks. Got a great figure, nice face and all that. Lovely knob. And. And she speaks and he goes, oh, God. Got a bit of a blow frog in a voice. Yeah. Not a bit of a voice like a bloke. But he thought. But, you know, that's her only down point. Sure. So he dances around with her and I think he sits on his knee, I think he said. Anyway, it turns out it's a fella. Yeah, right. A sobering lesson. Yeah. And what do you take from that? Look away, sort of. If you think you might be talking to us, just look at his sort of Adam's apple. Probably have a hairier ass than a woman. Yeah. I think you've gone too far then, though. I think you've already. I think you're already getting too close. It's a bit late to pull out. No pun intended. Was a pun intended? All right. Okay, we don't be disgusting then. Right. Okay. Right. And the. The results of. We ain't got a winner for the first time. Loads of winners. No, we haven't. We've done it, this feature, for three weeks. This is the first time I've managed to sort of. What? Well, goes with it. Wrong. The first one. Well, hang on, let's just. Let's do in reverse order firstly. So what's. What's the last one? The last one. The clue was that bloke does the sport on the telly and he's got a little kid. What's that? That's destiny's child, Des, who does ITV sport that's got a tiny child. Right. No, that's cut fine. They got that one. Middle one. The second one was, he doesn't like women. Yeah, he's got a couple of kids. That's a bit weird. Yeah. Right. That was PD. That was puff Daddy. That is offensive. Go on. It's not Puff Daddy. It's Puff Daddy. And he's not even called that anymore. It's called P Diddy. Wow. Okay. But they got that one. Yeah, yeah. And if. So, if I'm being tight, these lot are as well. Yeah, yeah. Tight means lean somewhere in Manchester. Go on. Right. And the first. The first one that they're having problems with. I don't think them birds should be allowed in this area. Boys. And it's not. It's not boy zone. It's. What's the clue? Again, I don't think them birds should be allowed in this area. That is perfect. A boy zone. No birds, no women. No women. Yeah, birds. Right. A boy zone. Sorry, Carl, if that isn't the answer. Their clue is better than yours. That is brilliant. What was your boy zone? It works perfectly. What's your answer, then? Bangles. I have no idea what that means. Like seagulls. So you don't want them in this area, so you're banning them bangles. Well, give it to Boyzone because Boyzone's better. What am I thinking? No, that's not what I'm thinking. It perfectly. Works perfectly. I think you got to give it to the ones that got the. The boy zone. Well, how about. Right? Because they didn't actually get into my. My head. Wow. How about we just keep back the David Attenborough and they can have. I'll chuck in the l raiser. Right, okay. Most of you and Blondie album and the mad. Yeah. Okay. Pick a winner at random. Pick a winner, Steve. I'm gonna give it to Paul Sloman who got those answers. And he also says, p's car, you're a moron. So, Paul. And good luck to him. He's got a crazy night tonight. If we can rush these over to him, he's got a cracking Saturday night. Well, if I'm a moron, I might get your address wrong when I send them to you. Play your songs. Annoyed because they didn't get a ban goal. A song from song for the ladies. I think we seem to have missed this a lot of weeks, but. So this year, I've been wanting to play this. Forget things. This is a band at Frente who kind of came and went and particularly interested, but they did this. Do this lovely acoustic version of the new order tune bizarre love triangle. And this just shows you how incredible the melodies and the. And the words and everything are. Brilliant. I'm new. Or just play this. Good night. Do you reckon Richard Anderson will be back next week? Yeah. Richard Anderson will not miss this show. Excellent. Every time I think of you, I get a shot right here.",

Origin from the old english frogger, meaning hoarseness. That's from Chris.

It doesn't tell us who it's from, although it's hard to believe. Now, at one time, medieval physicians believed that the secretions of a frog could cure a cough if they were coated on the throat of the patient. That in itself sounds repulsive, but what makes the idea even worse is the application of the secretions. Instead of painting the treatment on something which may also have seemed rational, a live frog was placed into the mouth of the sufferer, where it remained until the physician decided that the treatment was complete. Apparently, Shakespeare's son in law. That's a question. I don't know what that means. Anyway, it's no wonder that today a froggy or croaky attempt at speech is said to be a frog in your throat. You can see that what's happened there is Carl's misread, or been slightly misinformed about a medieval practice. In a sense, you're both winners just for taking part. What's your final one, Carl?",
