No, come on, let's get my name right from now on. That. That novelty's worn off. What is it? Is it Steve Merchant? Oh, yeah, they. Wrong one, isn't it, Mitchell? The guardian got it wrong. It's Steve Merchant. And the more I say Mitchell, the more people think. Exactly. It might be Mitchell. Oh, God. Sorry, Dave, but Carl wanted to start off with the stereophonics. Oh, loser. Because it was a newer track and Carl, now we've made him what he is. He was nothing when we found him. He was like. Now he's going, oh, we should start off with stereofons. I'm going. Trying to tell you what to do. If I want anyone's opinion, I don't. He probably comes with me. I imagine before Carl, I'd consult you, Steve. Thank you. Just keep it. Just because he was in a. Was it pillow. I bet you never pleased a crowd. Once. Did loads of times. Go on, then. What did you play? What's your biggest gig you ever played? I did, like a social club gig. Yeah. And it wasn't just about the music, either. I used to. What else could it be about? I used to take prizes and cigars. And stuff in a youth club. I just love these, like, 14 year old monks hanging out, going, let's go down here. You might have some fags and cigars for us. Well, it was whatever light was on my mum and dad's dressing table. That could have been embarrassing. That could have been deeply embarrassing. You've won. And third party, some handcuffs and a black mamba. I'm not saying that at any point in your upbringing, your parents left around any kind of marathon aid on the dressing table. Don't think I'm saying that, Carl. I'm not suggesting. He doesn't like this, does he? No. I can understand why. Oh, yeah, because it's about his. It's about his parents having sex. Well, they must have. Yeah. At least three times. I think I was an accident. I think he's been ongoing. Just because my brother and sister are quite older than me. Yeah, me too. I was an accident, I know that. Yeah. How old's your brother and sister? I think my sister's about 39. Right. And my brother's about 37. Okay. And you're 29? 29, right. So, yeah, my next one's eleven years older than me. Yeah, that was definitely. Yeah. Do you want to have a hug. You too, or. Yeah. Yeah. Dealing with it now you got. What would you like to see us have our goal? You had a mobile disco. You had a laugh. Aren't you? I was. I. Every single gig I did. It's dynamite. People loved it. I was storming. What? I ran it from about the age of 14 to 18. What was it called? Was it called in the name of our mobile disco? Yeah. It had two names in its lifetime. Yeah. It started its life as. Bear with it. Go on. The rock and roll dj's. Oh, my God. The rock and roll d. That's the. I mean, that's the worst. Yeah, that's the most appalling. But then it became pretty bad after that, when it became the fantasy island roadshow. Why? I don't know. Because everyone up to you look like tattoo. Partly that. And I. Because I liked the program Fantasy island. Why did you like the program Fantasy island? Well, it was about love on an island. It was about a midget on an island. No, the midget was a minor character. People going to find love. You obviously switched off once midget had gone off and said, there's the plane. That's that. Then your parents went, that's over then. It's only five minutes long. Yeah, well, it's. That's. What's that? Fantasy midget. Yeah. What happened then? Because didn't they, they, um, acted out their fancies on the night people would. Pay to go to the island to live out their own romantic fantasies. And then variably. That's what it was always about getting. It was a kind of love island. Yeah. Was it? Well, not always. Sometimes they might be. Maybe I didn't watch Harlem. Maybe I did just see him, like, smack a little tattoo around the head. I think you just saw the trailer. Ah. Oh, really? So what does this sort of go? I've always wanted to have someone in. Well, no, it might be something like, you know, I've always wanted to sort of, you know, live out being a gunslinger in a wild west frontier town, you know, so you might kind of create that. What's that got to do with. Well, invariably would find love or he'd sort out some emotional problem he had. It was much more a spiritual, emotional journey than it was about little midgets running around. But was it like, oh, I'd like to be a cowboy and, like, remember the shag? Like those letters you wrote? Did you want to fix it? I'd like to meet five star, and if something happens, so be it? Well, but no, I have to just say once, though, just about my. This is my djing credentials. I was once playing music at Scout Jamboree when I was about 17. 1617. Big gig. It was a thousand scouts there. Yeah, right. And I tell you this, we were playing on stuff. They were loving it. They were dancing. It was in a big marquee. Right. I slapped on smells like teen spirit. Yeah, right. I went mad. They went mad for it. They were. They were mushing. They were climbing at the poles. The organizers were going, switch that off. Switch that off. Right? They're going crazy. And I was there going, no, that's. That's what they like. I'm gonna do it. And it was unbelievable. It was just like. Then I came in with raging machine killing, in the name of the placement, wild. And they were trying to get me off the decks. It was like Bill. It was like Bill Grundy interviewing the Sex Pistol. And then when the heads had you killed, some sort of mafia thing, it was all hushed up. That the scouts went there one night with all candles and they said, very grave. And that. And that was the end of the film. It was a film, I assume genuinely happened. I assume this didn't really happen. Yes, it did. I swear to God. I was playing someone's, like, team spirit, and it went wild. And the organizers were going, switch that off. They're going crazy. And I was going, no, it's what they want. Can I say something? It was brilliant, that, to me, I've known you for about four years and I've heard all these things. That must be the highlight of your life. Unbelievably so, yeah. You've never had anything that good or exciting since, have you? One day I hope to sleep with a lady, and hopefully that'll slide into second place. Rock the cas. I love the fact you had at least three minutes to get that right. I know. And get that right. I know, but my mouth was full of Maryland cookies. Yeah. You know, last week. And this is. Oh, this would blow your mind. He came in, you know, he bought for himself about ten penguins. Who buys penguins? Still no. All wagon wheels. Oh, I've never liked wagon wheels. Not been a fan. No, no, but I'm sorry about that. It's the clash and rock the Kazbah. Talking about records, have I told you that time, my brother in law, he was moving out of his place, I think, moving in with my sister, and I was about, like, I don't know, 13. And so he was about 30, and I moved in and he brought around all his records when he was stories to leave him at our house. And he had all these old sort of records, fifties and sixties records, right? And they put him upstairs and I was looking through them and it's just all like Elvis stuff and Beatle stuff. And there was a mate of mine who loved Elvis, okay? And he had loads of chemicals. Yeah, he had loads of chemicals. And I was into chemistry and he said, I swap me some chemicals for them. So I sort of nicked about five Elvis singles and I got all these chemicals and then just gilt. What sort of chemicals? Just things like, you know, just things like from a chemistry set. Just, you know, crystals and metals and manganese, all that sort of stuff that I just like to muck around with. And then the guilt just hit me. I just thought, well, he's going to notice that. And I just. One night I just came downstairs and I confessed to my mum and she went, all right, well, I won't tell him, but you've got to be good. And it's sort of like I was just really, really good for a year. And then. And then I was told this, no, no, you haven't. You've just reminded me of something. And then I remember when I was about 18, my brother was talking about it and he said, did you ever play those records I left for you? Brilliant. He told my mum, he said, these are for Ricky. She just didn't tell you. Was sharp, wouldn't she? She used opportunism there. Oh, that's genius. And that was it. That's why I was good. But you've never stolen anything since, have you? No, I don't, I don't, I don't. Except that spate of shoplifting after that. To teach your mum a lesson. Yeah, yeah, well, I went round and. Arson? No, no, I just couldn't believe it. I just. Oh, I remember. I think all kids go through a phase of shoplifting. Well, and when I was going through it, I used to just. Just little things, just like magic markers and magazines, mars bars, that sort of thing. Yeah, cigars and dildos. And one day, right, same thing that my mate Anthony, his mom called up my mom and said, I've got to meet up with you, I've got to have a word with you. And she said, what about? She said, I don't want to talk about it over the phone. So she goes, all right, well, yeah, come around tonight, then. So anyway, my mum sees me. She don't want to be in an awkward position and, like, be a bit embarrassed and what have you? So she sees me and she goes, right, Anthony's mom's coming round. What have you been doing? Yeah. So I go, oh, God. I said, I've been nicking stuff. So she goes, like what? Not big stuff. I've had a few calculators and Mars bars and stuff. How many? I just work out. Hold on, works out at 7.2 per day. How many calculators do you need? So it was when that failed. Failed maths, didn't you? Everyone wanted a calculator. It was like a trendy thing when. It rang in Manchester a couple of years ago. Yeah. So anyway, so I told her all. This and I confess, computers will make it there. Will confess to me. It is magic in the back of battery. Go on, confess to Nick and all this stuff. She comes round, she only wanted to borrow some money. She's really. I don't like asking. I was a bit embarrassed to ask you over the phone, but can I borrow 20 quid? Oh, that's fantastic. And there's me. That's great. And it's nothing to yours. He went, hold on, I'm let you work out the interest on that back 10%, she'll owe you four pounds 40. So your mum was a loan shark? Yeah. Did she mention stuff with that other. Because what I'm saying is, presumably you got your mate in trouble. No, no, no. She went, no worries. I'll just go and get my purse. It's on the dressing table. Exactly, yeah. Carl, do you want a cigar? What other things you used to give away at your disco then, that you'd find on the dressing table? Used to go into your parents room and go, what can I give away tonight? It was stuff like cigars. I had a pair of tights unopened. You know, you get them in like a long. Who did you give that to? The. The prize? It was stuff like, you know, we did like a little raffle. Just imagine Carl going there just for a. Who's going? Joyride. Pretty Polly sheer. Exactly. He was doing a bank job this year. Exactly. That's what it's used for. Yeah. Just little bits of, you know, unopened makeup, just stuff like that. And did their parents not notice? No, because it's stuff that you're not that bothered about. If a telly went missing, they'd notice it. They wouldn't. They'd be staring at a wall for three days. But a pair of tights and a cigar and that got away with it. Yeah, but it's funny as well because, like, you had you had two names. I just, like, remembered. I started off as dazzling. Darrow and disco just because the first lights I could afford belonged to someone who had their name put in lights. Right. So I went along with that. Pretend you were called Darren. That's lovely. Is it worth it? Brilliant. And then it went on to Pilkins making music. Yeah, that's great. Anyway, we have some more music. Yeah, we've been waiting for it. What are you gonna play, Carl? We've got the Cooper Temple claws. Brilliant. Yes. Steve Merchant here. Steve Merchant. Yeah. Okay. Don't keep saying it, Carl. Obviously. Yeah. Now, we've been digging around in Carl's office, haven't we? As ever, Rick. He's a little bit nervous about this. Well, it doesn't need to be. I don't think he is. You just need to trust us, Carl. Just trust us. Trust with the music. Trust us with the speech output. Trust. That's easier for me to say. Yeah. But I just. I'm conscious, Rick, that sometimes perhaps we're a little ill prepared. And I just wanted to make sure that we were sort of keeping ourselves abreast of developments, changes at the station. Policy. Thanks. You know, policies particularly. And I was lucky enough just to stumble across this, and I feel that actually, a couple of weeks back, we were a little ill prepared because we hadn't read this. Yeah. This is the XFM information. It's the guidelines, if you will, surely, on how to react to deaths, disasters and other news emergencies. Yeah. And there's this very important ones, like a royal death. There's like, you know. Well, there's certain questions. I mean, obviously, the general guidelines state that occasionally something will happen in the world that prompts XFM to break away from the normal programming and react to our audience's feelings of shock or grief. As broadcasters, we have a duty to. Think about our show there. Are they all shows? I mean. No, no, not people being caused grief, just. Carl's on the air. Right. You mean, like. I mean a bigger, even royal dying. A royal darling, or some kind of, you know, major disaster. We should be able to tailor our output to show that we feel the same way as the audience in these times of trouble. That would never involve the station shutting down completely, Rick. No, I want to reassure you of that now. And it would never involve playing classical music or stopping all speech content. Sure, because they put that in there. Because a lot of stations, that's exactly what they do, but deemed it that we don't have to go completely down the line there. We have to do it. People need company at times like this. Yeah. And should be able to look to us for both factual information and emotional reaction. We simply have to change our tone and our playlist to show that we're all feeling the same thing, be it. Oh, my God, I can't believe this is happening. Or. Well, it's pretty sad, but she was 101, after all. And that's actually in that. That's what it actually says in the general guidelines. That's as they are stated. If you should hear about the death of a major royal, this is the information that you're actually reading this, by the way. Yeah, I'm reading this. What you should do is say nothing about this on air under any circumstances. Drop all the ads and promos from your schedule. And if Chris Smith, the news guys in the building, get him in the studio immediately. Yeah, that's what it says. Carl. Yeah. If Smitty is. I don't care where he is, I don't care if he's on holiday, let's. Phone him up now and tell him someone's died to see how he would react. See how long it takes him to get down here. Where does Smitty live? Cause I know where he lives. He lives in a cave and he slides down a pole and he gets into a car. His butler is up there and he sorts things out. I suppose the approach there is that only Chris can deliver this tragic news. Yeah. If it was you or I. Yeah, it wouldn't. It wouldn't. It wouldn't have the same. I remember. Do you remember the XFM as it first started? It launched the day after Princess Diana died. I know, I know. I'd never done radio before. I was nervous enough and it was launched and it was. Oh, was it the first night? Because what I forgot, actually, until you mentioned that then, is, of course, you used to host your own phone in show. Oh, man, I like that. And I gave that up after a week because it was just too stressful. I have never seen a man so petrified. I know. His time preventing people getting through on the phone lines. Yeah. He just wouldn't let people come on air. And for the. When I had to go on air, right. Um, my mates sort of, like, came over the first day and they were mucking around and I was having a drink with them, roasted work, and I was gonna go on air in a minute and I was, like, drinking shandy or something, because I was saying, I don't want to be drunk. And I kept saying, don't swear. Telling my mates not to swear. I look at me like I was mental. I was going, don't swear, because I swear, I was terrified of two things. Just swearing and. And operating the desk. I thought, I'm gonna. Even if I get through operating the desk, I'm gonna swear. And it just. Oh, it was. It was awful. Didn't you. Didn't you spill coffee over the machine and then go, oh, shit on your first link? I can't remember, but I know it wasn't a triumph. No, I started off with. I was like the music. And I started off with a classical piece by a bloke called Kunz, who's a german composer. Brilliant. So I knew it was. It was okay. Off. You're always off. Yeah, but. And so how did it go? Because I remember it was appalling. Carl, he's a composer. Look it up. Yeah, I know he is. Right. Oh, 8700, 800 1234, if you know what the composer I'm talking. What? Yeah, we've done it now. Chill out, Carl, come on. You know what people are like. What? You take things badly, don't they? Like who? Just. It's like a bull to a red rag. Whatever. The thing is that we say bad words and we get in trouble. But I was listening to Hart the other day, and they played Luther Van Dross. And that song was it never too much? Never too much. Play the lyric in this is disgusting. Hear that? Woke up today. Looked at your picture just to get me started. That's filthy. Play it again. Woke up today. Look at your picture just to get my side. That is supreme. Filthy. What I feel. What is he doing? Just say like that. Imagine that. He's got a young girl's picture and he's going, oh, thanks for that. And he phones up and goes, what did they say? You know that picture you gave me? She goes, yeah. He goes, well, I looked at it just to get me started. That poor young woman. I imagine more that, like, she's sleeping, and he just sneaks in and just. He's got a point on camera. She wakes up, he goes, what are you doing? She goes up to. He goes, no, I'm just taking a picture. Well, why? I'm gonna write you tomorrow. We're gonna. Yeah, well, I need something to get me started. What do you mean, get you started? Yeah, you know, in the morning. And then that's on heart. All right, 6.2. So don't come on air and tell. Us what we can say. We can't say classical composers names or philosophers. Like, can't exactly so don't tell us that, Carl, all right? Just play a record. What you got, Steve? Some ride, Steve. Yeah. I just think it's time that we listen to some ride, Rick. We haven't listened to him. I don't know about you and I, but I haven't listened to him to any for about six, seven weeks. Yeah. Just thought it'd be good to have him on the air again. And it's a tragedy they split up. This is the classic Chelsea girl. Play it. I know, yeah, it's great. But. Influenced lots of bands at that time. The old Brit pop thing and the. A wall of sound. And they weren't. Were they shoe gazers, do you think? They were? Weren't they? Well, that's what they thought of, because there's a lot of nude lead guitar, but, yeah, good melodies as well, Rick. And that's always important. It is to me. I don't know about you, Carl, but it is important to us. We've just had a couple of people, Sarah and Claire, call out and wish us luck for the BAFTAs. But for some reason, they want one of us to do an impression of Leslie Phillips. Can't do it. Doesn't he say ding dong and hello and all that? That's not bad. But I want. I want Kyle to do it, though. Yeah, go on. Go on. Hello. Well done. Say, ding dong. Ding dong. Nice. Yeah. Do you do any other impressions? No. Hello. Do that. Hello. Yeah. You look like a ventriloquist dummy. Brilliant. Oh, God. Do. My name is Bond. James Bond. As though it were shown. James Bond. Do that. Go on. My name's Bond. No, do it as though you were doing an impression, Sean. I'm. What? So I'm trying to be scottish. Well, yeah. Well, yeah, sort of. Perhaps a bit more specific than that, Sean connery. My name's Bond. Keep going. My name's Bond. James Bond. Thanks, jimmy stewart. It's not like this. This is the best fun. It's like having your very own fisher price toy for 2 hours a week. It's great. Do roger moore. Do that. Roger moore. Phyllis pierce. Percy sugden. I'm licensed to kill. Anyway, she just said no. This is a great game. Yeah. We'll come back to this another time. Anything. Anything you want carl to do. Carl's homework today was coming up with those, you know, those lateral thinking things go on, those stupid. They're ridiculous, aren't they? A man went into a field and died, and you're meant to ask questions like, oh, was it? It turns out his parish didn't open. So it's basically. It's not logic, it's. What am I thinking? Well, there's that one where there's a man in. This is the worst I've ever heard. A man is found dead lying in a phone box. Right. His wrists are cut, he's bled to death, and there's glass everywhere. Yeah. Right. And the phone's hanging off the hook. Right. Yeah. What happened to him? I know this. Yeah. Right. Do you know what the answer is, Carl? It's ridiculous. He was a fisherman. Yeah. He was on the phone. Someone asked him how big his fish was. He did that gesture, like fisherman always do, to say it was much bigger. Than actually his arms out. His arms went through the glass and he slashed his wrists and he died. Why did you do that with someone on the phone when they can't see how. How big? You're actually saying. Well, that's one of the many problems with that conundrum. Yeah. Not the point we were making, but again, good. I mean, you're there. That is good thinking. Yeah. Yeah. But so what, you had to come up with some of these? I didn't know this was his challenge. Yeah. Have you come up with one? I came up with three. And they're all belters. Oh, well, if it's as good as your quote about happiness, that we had to guess which was yours and which was the real ones, like, faking it. I cannot wait. I'm looking forward to this. I mean, I literally can't wait. Should we do it now? Well, I'm tempted to save it because I just want to mention to people that they should be very excited because it's going to be Carl's special night tomorrow. You excited, Carl? Yeah. Oh, this is. Yeah, me and Steve, because we were nominated, we get a guest for the best. And it's. It isn't say guest, it actually says, you know, partner. So I'm taking my partner and Steve's taking Carl. Yeah, but what Carl doesn't realize is you will have to pretend you're his partner, otherwise you won't be able to hold hands. Is this your. Is this really your partner? It's not just a guest. That's how it is. Neither we go in like that or we can't get in. You have to. You just have to be with him when you go up there. I mean, does he have told you. Should we should hold hands? But I think what we should do is just, to me, make sure that there's nothing at all that, like, it's gonna go wrong. We should just do a little kiss, just like. Sort of like cheek to cheek, just to show them that. Yeah. You know, you're not. He's not just getting his mates in for a free meal. You are actually partners. No, I'm not for that. Why not? Well, because we know we're not actually getting a problem. Looking quite good. Because you've got a good looking fella. I meant to look like, you know, I mean, I'm not gay, but if I was, I don't think I'd go for your. Oh, he's done you, Steve. It's turned on you again. I cannot believe we were trying to get in. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I have got the cream of London's tottie phoning me up, trying to get an invite to the BAftas. Yeah. Right. We have very graciously asked you if you would like to come along. Well, that worries me even more that you've got women calling you up. Carl, Carl, I can't choose between them. If I let one of them down, I'm gonna. They're gonna destroy them. They'll be ruined. Their lives be ruined. It's better for me to take you and not, you know, ruin the lives of any of those poor. When. When he told them he was taking you, it was like a scene from Gracelands. There was just like. There was weeping. They were crying like. It was horrible, hundreds of them. And I got upset. He just had to say that. Just chill out. Bitches. Didn't. Yeah, I did. I just said, you know, you're all my hose, but I can't choose between you. So I'm taking Carl. I'm taking Carl. You know, he gets. He could get you a discount. Fox. No, I had a letter from the people that there's a. Listen, Carl, there's an organization that sponsors the BAFTA awards in terms of clothes and fashion. They sent me a letter. They said, your partner. They've not specified the sex. They've said your partner can come along and choose an outfit. Now, I suspect, by the look of it, is a woman's outfitters. I'm thinking we could get you a lovely trouser suit. Feminine, right? But I think people will be fooled. It'll just be a little bit roomy in the hip and probably now on the shoulders, but you're a bit skinny. Why don't you take it? Because it's a lot of an insult. And maybe just some pearls as well, be lovely. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you want. I haven't got anything sorted to wear yet. See you slagging me off, you're likely to end up going in a tracksuit. Yeah, I'm going out today. I've never bought a suit since I was, like, eleven. Right. I went to my brother's wedding. That's the last time I wore a suit. Right. Really? You can't get anywhere near it now. Can't get into that. No, no. That was a good day. What was it? What sort of suit was it? It was like a sort of a gray silver one. Excellent. Quite flary. Well, try and go some silver one. I just think that with your little round head, what did you. What did that look like? I looked all right. Like he'd landed from the. I didn't really need to wear a suit either, because I didn't. I hardly went into the church, was in the car park, right. And it's when my brother was in the army and he had a Ford Capri with one of them horns that goes. Did it just sat there. Why didn't he come in his tank? I just. I just sat in that, doing that all day and the vicar was getting, well, annoyed with me. What, when the service was on? Yeah. It was driving everyone. Were you just allowed to do what you wanted when you were growing up? Like Nelson months from the Simpsons? You just. Were you just allowed. Didn't matter. Was there any discipline? You didn't have teachers? You didn't. Didn't know. Just. Why didn't someone come out? And I got a couple of good. Items off my dad a couple of times. What, for just being mopey. Most the time. If I had a strap on it. Ate that, he could go out and burn some it down or nick something. But don't wander around with your head down. Didn't he smack you for not liking a castle once? Yeah. Went to Carnarvon the other day and I was bored. I was at that age when I just wanted to go in an arcade and my dad was saying, come and see the castle. You know, there's history here. And I still don't like castles. It's one of them things that, again, just too far back to sort of even think about people living in them. Yes. I mean, so it's just like, it's a wreck, you know, knock it down, flatten the thing. And I was being really hoping, isn't that great? It's weird because now, like, my mum and dad have retired and gone to Wales. Yeah. And now and again he texts me there, and every time we get to the point where he gave me a clout, he goes, you getting flashbacks, son? Yeah, well, sobering lesson for you. Yeah. You're not on the British Heritage Committee anymore, are you? This is the National Trust land tarmac, the biggest car park in Britain, for Christ's sake. So, look, you're looking forward to the awards, are you? Tomorrow you better say yes, because otherwise. No, it'll be all right. I mean, I've told a couple of people and they got like, God, you dead lucky, in a way. Oh, they did lucky. It's like Santa's coming in it other way people talk to. Carl. You're a lucky boy. Aren't you going to the Baftas with Steve? It's just a posh raffle at the end of the day, though. In it, do you know, it's. You know, they give away some tights and stuff. Exactly. Yeah. It's Chris Tower goes, I found. I went to my parents house, I found these just lying around. I put winners and losers and. Yeah, but what food. Well, quite. Yeah. But what is exciting, surely, is the Rasmus has. And the brushing shoulders with the rich and famous. I'm not into that. You're not? No. I don't feel you're going to appreciate this, like we thought. It's weird because Suzanne said to me this morning it would, you know, who would you like to meet there? Is he anyone who, like, you know, you can get close to. And it's like, God, you know, I really admire your, you know, big fan of yours, whatever. And this is me and Steve. So you're here now, you know, I. Really admire your big fanny. I didn't. What did you say? You know, if you're a big fan of it. All right, yeah. Sorry. There isn't anyone, really. Do you know what I mean? You know, you two are all right. Thanks, Jonathan Ross. Are you going to. It might do. I don't know. I cannot but feel we could have exploited this more. We could have maybe run a competition to let someone win, you know, if you're not going to appreciate it. Yeah. Are you gonna get a trouser suit? Are you gonna get a ladies trouser suit? I just think then if you go sort of like looking macho and walking down with him, you know, they know that you're not really partners. And I just think it's a slap in the face for BAFTA. That's true enough. No, it doesn't matter what you wear, though. Can't you mince a little bit. Can't you at least sort of walk a little bit minty because you've got such a matcha sort of mank walk? Elton John's fellow doesn't look gay and stuff he wears and that, does he? I mean, it means nothing. But that's because Elton's doing the work for him by dressing as, like some kind of restoration dame. Yeah. I love the fact he dresses Ann Widdicombe for special occasions. That his hair done like her. That's great. Anyway, music. Yeah, this is a very underrated album. It's Richard Ashcroft's alone with everybody and I know it got a bit of a slag and it didn't sell as well. People were going, oh, it's no urban hymns and maybe it's not, but he got criticized for being pop. But this is a great tune on here. You're my mind in my sleep and I think it's really good. And you on my mind in my sleep is that one, Carl. Sorry. Good. Okay. Oh, what I did want to do is I want to play some adverts. Now, there goes the fear on XFN 104.9. Well into the last hour and only two more shows. That's true enough. And we're away for three months. Oh, I'm Ricky Gervais, obviously. Yeah. Steve Merchant. Little Carl. Now, Carl, his homework was one of those stupid lateral thinking problems. We might, we maybe should give an. Example of the Romeo and Juliet, right? Romeo's asleep on the bed, Juliet's on the floor covered in water and broken glass. What happened? And you ask all these stupid questions and it's, Romeo's a cat and Juliet's a goldfish. Awful. What am I thinking? Yeah, yeah, go on in, Carl. Right, first one. Yeah. There's a bloke lying on the floor, right? He's cut his head, blood's coming out of his head and all his mates come running up and they're all stood round him and they don't set their ass off as a mark of respect. That is outrageous. Why didn't they take their ass off? I'm laughing, but it's probably as good as. These are really good. Did you make them all up? Yeah. No, I mean, did you make up all the ones that already exist? A bloke's fallen with his. Yeah. He's lying on the floor. Yeah. He's dead. Yeah. His mates come running, wasn't it? Was it important that his head was cut? Um, I don't know. Would it be? No, kind of. He'd have been wearing a hat. He wouldn't be dead if he was wearing a hat. What's your answer? No. You meant to answer question. You don't just go watch your answer. You say, where's the you go, no. And I have to guess, it's obviously like sort of motorbike cycle stunt team or a parachute. Why didn't they take their ass off? Because they're probably still on the motorbikes or summer or. Yeah, but if you mark a respect to someone, you could set your helmet off. What? They're parachutists. Why can't they take their helmets off? Because they're still coming down from the skills. But he's on the floor dead. Well, they can look down and see him on the floor. Are they on the floor, Kyle? They're on the floor. They're walking. Are they? Yeah, well, they sort of stood there looking at him. They're stood there. They're stood on the floor. Look, they're soldiers. Why? But why? Because it might be in a battle zone. They might have their helmets on and he's been shot in the head. Well, that does work. You see, this is my point. That one works. That one works. Unless you've given us a piece of information where that doesn't work, what's the difference? Why is yours different to he's been shot in the head in the trenches and they're looking at him and they keep their helmets on. I just don't. Don't think it matters as much if they're in the trench. They're already guarded a little bit, so they could set their hats off. It's the best, mate. For God's sake. Are they normal hats? No, don't get. Right. If I told you what sort of hats they are, you'd have the answer. Oh, okay, I've got a guess what sort of a hat it is then, have I? Right. Is it a trilby? No. Is it a. I know what it is. What? They're spacemen. No. Oh, that's a good one. That works as well. This is my point. I like that one a lot. It works. He's falling on the moon and they're not. The moon happened. It was set up. We know that. Yeah. Okay, Kyle, what's your answer? Builders on a building site, huh? Why is that different to soldiers? Because bricks don't fall in wars, but bullets fly. Right, next one. No. Let's play a record and we'll come back to it, Carl, while you think about what you've done. Oh, yeah. Embarrassed? Let's play some classic suede. Yeah. And this is for David and Kieran. I think you wanted a bit of. Bit of butler at his best. Come on, crap it on. I hate you. Butler. Coming next. Your next lateral problem. Number two. Brilliant X wide there. Indeed. I think their second or third single. Brilliant. All the way back ten years ago. Absolutely. You know, I mean, metal Mickey on XFM 104.910 years ago. Must have, mustn't it? I think was dramas 91. I think so, yeah. Go on. Go on in. Carl sat him on them. This is a bit easier, but I still think it's a good one. So this is, uh. We should explain what this is if you just tuned in. It's one of those stupid lateral thinking. Problems that Carl himself has created. Yeah. That was his homework. Right. This one. It's a fella. He has a normal day doing. Doing stuff. Nothing wrong with him. Right. It's the twist in the tower. It's just like towels. The unexpected. Just a normal day. Nothing wrong with him. Hold on, though. He's got the legs of a fish. Go on. That's why he's been hiding his legs. He does his. The legs of a fish. So he can't carry on. He has his working day and that, and then he gets a bit tired, goes to bed. He puts the light on, leaves it on, goes to bed. No, that's crazy. That's mental. I can't think what's happened. Anyway. His radio head. Right, okay. Why? The question is, why does he put. The light on when he's had a normal day? He's coming from work. Is that right? He's coming from work or he's not been working? He's been working stuff. I think. You think you've made it up, Carl, you can decide. So the question is, why has he put the light on when he's asleep? There's a reason that he's put the light on when he's asleep. Has he gone to sleep? No. Carl, don't shrug. You're meant to answer these questions. He put the light on before he went to bed. Yeah. And the question you're asking me is why? What's the scenario? And the lights on and. Yeah, but he's gone to sleep. Yeah. He started reading and then he fell asleep. No. Did he? Intent. So he intentionally, for some reason, put. The light on every night. It's mad. Sounds mad. It's called every night. He does it. Yeah. He puts a lot on. Carl. Carl, is the point of this. The. He puts the light on for a very good reason. Not for us, but for some people. He'S blind and it's always been on and he thinks he's turning it off, but it was on in the day and he thinks he's turning it off, but he's turning it on because he's blind. That was stupid. That works. So. That works great, Rick. Yeah. Thank you, Carl. So you gotta come up with. Hang on. Why would you put a light on? No, he thinks he's off. Yeah, but why would he turn it on anyway? To think so B. Doesn't get burgled so people know he's in because he can't see him. So he just, like, he puts the light on when he's there, then he turns the light off when he goes to bed. So people think it's fine, but he's got it out of kilter and actually is. He's walking around in the dark all day. I don't believe that. If you blind, you turn your light. I don't think you'd be on your own, would you? I'm not having that for a. Blind people live on their own. Second. Well, some people do. Lonely blind people live on their own. No, if you, if you like, if you got bad eyes. Any of them women, any there. Any blind women who are living on the. No, I mean, if you know of some blind women. 700, 801, two, three, four. We've gone through this. If you are a blind woman with. With, with no standards and you don't care. Annoying voices and smell. Yeah. Then get in touch with you. Yeah. I mean, you've got to be within. The ages of, say, 25 to 65, you know. Well, call it 75. You fussy, you fussy. Would have a sign. If you were blind, would you live in London? Because someone said yesterday there was one struggling outside in lesser Square and I don't understand if you would. I mean, you know, it might have been a tourist. But why come to London if you, if you're blind? It's the worst place in the world to come if you're blind. Hear the sights. To hear the sights. It's a bit mad in it there. Well, they have. They do the same. They have tourist needs like anyone else. Yeah. Nobody. It sort of stinks. And you'd go away going, oh, it's not that good. I just thought that. I thought it was a bit weird. Never mind your concern for the partially sighted or part sight impaired people coming to London. Get on with this. Yeah. So, yeah, so there he is. Yeah. Oh, a bit tired. Yeah. Just put the light on. Yeah. So he turns the light on and he goes to bed. Yeah. Should we um. Should we play a truck? He's not. It is not. He's not sleeping on the job. He's a lighthouse keeper. Well done, if you like. That's not it. Carl, his lighthouse keeper. Right. Why wasn't the light on all the time? It's light in the day, you idiot. Play a record. What? Play a record. You're a buffoon. No, actually the lights. The light isn't on the day, is it? No, it's not. I think you're the buffoon. Yeah. Carl has won dead on my head. Wasting time on my own sleep. Rescue me, take me back. Hundred reasons and silver on XFM 104. I love the fact that Carl went a little bit mental then. So happy that he thinks that a lighthouse keeper pops the light on at the same time every. Are you telling me it was never foggy? Everyone has a routine in the job. And why was he going home from work knackered? What had he been doing all day? He did. He said he went home. He's just in a day's work. He said he went home knackered and puts a lot on and goes to sleep. That's what he said. But he's maybe a part time light. Ask the library. Does he as well? Listen, Rick. Don't listen. I'm really with Carl here. What, he definitely got you? He said, yeah, but then you embarrass yourself by saying stupid. But you stupid. You would never put a night ounce light on during the day. What's your. What's the next one? I've been painting it that day. Oh, I did. Extra shattered. Right, okay, the next one. Last one. This? Yeah. Natural thinking. Natural thinking. And you've. You've written this yourself? You've had no help from anyone? No, I've come up with these on my own. Okay, right, last one. This bloke. Yeah, the bloke. He's got a brother that is never met. Right. They got separated at birth. Right. You know. Anyway, he gets a letter in the post. Yeah. He says, oh, I tracked you down. Yeah. Meet me at the airport. Yeah? Okay. Soon as he gets the airport, he goes, there he is. And he goes walking over. How did he know that was his brother? It never seen. They were twins. They look exactly the same. They're born the same day. Now Steve's got it. Yeah, that's what I mean. So he knew they were born the same day. So we knew they were twins. Yeah. I didn't say they were born on the same day. Did. No, no, I'm just reiterating. They would be, though, if they looked. Yeah. Identical. Yeah. Sorry about that. When we've got you there, karmic. Yeah. You're quite upset about that. That was one out of three, though. What about this, then? Do you know that one, them two brothers born on the same day of the same mother and the same father. But they weren't twins. Why say that one again? Two brothers. Yeah. Are born on the same day of the same mother and father. But they. They weren't twins. Why not? This is good radio. You see that? The problem is I heard you saying to Steve, I'm gonna do that one about the shark in the pool. So I'm trying to think. This is nothing to do with that one, though, is it? Clearly. Give him the answer. The answer is they would. They were two of triplets. Another brother. So do you want to do the. One about the shark in the pool? Okay. A bloke just in his swimming trunks walks into a swimming pool full of man eating sharks. He walks around for a bit and slowly gets out the other side. And he's not bitten or anything. Why not? Because they'd already eaten. No, they're starving hungry. He walked through the water? Yes. He wasn't like a bridge. No. He actually was in the water soaking wet. The sharks, he, uh. He had like a metal suit on. No, naked, apart from swimming trunks. Um. There were real sharks. Real sharks swimming about. There was money and. Hungry. Yeah. Really hungry. Yeah. This fella gets into the same pool. Yeah, the same pool, exactly. He walks. Right. It gets in the steps. Yeah. It's down. He walks across. Yeah. He's in the water. Yeah. Up to his neck. Yeah. And the sharks are near him. Yeah. They're attacking him. They're attacking. They're actually attacking him. But he still gets out. Okay. Walks out the other side and he's not. Hasn't got a mark on him. I don't know. Go on, Rick. What's the answer there? I was lying about the sharks. There weren't any sharks. I was lying about the sharks. Completely lined, just made up, just an empty pool. That's just stupid. That's our point. They're rubbish. Oh, dear. Oh, defended and confused. Come on, play song now. Go on then. Good fortune, PJ Harvey on XFM 104.9. On Ricky Gervais, obviously. Steve. Carl, I've got a real one for you. This is a logic question, not a stupid one. Just very quickly, ten black balls in a bag and ten white balls in a bag. Yeah. How many balls do you have to pull out to ensure you've got a pair of the same color? Well, what's stopping you putting your hand in and pulling out? Four, because I asked for the minimum number. So what's. How many do you have to pull out to ensure you've got a pair? That doesn't. Doesn't say all of them. That'll ensure it. What's the minimum number you have to pull out? Eleven. Because you. Why do you need eleven? What? Because there's ten black balls, ten white balls. Yeah. Yeah. Say if you're. For some reason you pulled out all the ten black balls. Yeah. Right. Yeah. You'd have a pair, wouldn't you? You'd have a pair after the first two. Yeah. So what's the minimum number you have to pull out to ensure? Two? No, because you might pull a white one and a black one. Yeah, but I don't understand what you're saying. Sometimes I get that impression, the way you look at me, like Helen from big brother. I've always assumed that. Right. What's the minimum number you have to pull out to ensure you have two of the same colour? Three. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. Yeah, you can use that one. Yeah, that's a good one. So what's the minimum. What's the minimum number you have to pull out to ensure you have four of the same color? Eight. I don't know. I understand. The first one. We've done it now. Okay. All right, we'll leave it there. That's good. Good. Okay. Now, white Van Carl. This is, uh. Yeah, this is where we. Too much. If you've seen his face and seen his eyebrows sort of went down while you were doing that. He genuinely looked pained. It's like you're back at school, isn't it? Yeah. He's starting to get hard work now. Okay. We just do white Van Carl. Then. This is your opinions. You can't be wrong on this, can you? There's no right or wrong answer here. Okay. Okay. But so this is where we ask Carl his views on the, the big news stories of the week. Basically, we've, we've stolen an idea from the sun newspaper and so. This isn't cruel, this program. Is it picking on me? It's not, is it? It's weird because a few people have said, oh, you're picking on me. So it depends how you look at things. Sure. Yeah. But you do like it? We. I mean, we can look at it like it's a laugh. So it's not fun for us. You know, we like you. You know, you're our favorite, I'm going to say, thing in the world, but I don't mean that, you know, in a derogatory way. I'm cool with it. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Okay. So your views, please, on the fact that attitudes are changing to the possible marriage of Charles and Camilla. Oh, what do you think of that? The roars at the moment because the recent tragedies are apparently high in the polls and people are coming around to the idea of Charles and Camilla getting hitched. What's your thoughts? Whatever, really. I mean, if they're happy with it. The thing that comes out of it most is it just goes to show, right, that there is someone for everyone. Just because. I mean, no disrespect to Camilla, I'm not a good looking person either, but she's a stunner and yet she's gone and picked up a royal. Right. Yeah. So I think it's good for things like that to happen because it cheers you up. Do you know, I mean, gives you a bit of hope. Thanks, Carl. So, yeah, it's good, you know, if they're happy, if anyone's happy, it's a good story in it. Yeah. I mean, yeah, he's had a bit of bad luck and now he's got someone else in his life. I'm just. While he's doing this, I'm just doing a list of questions to ask him what he thinks of things in the world. Okay. What do you make of. Well, now, listen, this may be a non story or it may be the biggest story that's about to break. Ulrica Johnson and Sven Goran Ericsson's affair. Are you familiar with this? It's over the papers today. Apparently Ulrika and Sven are going out, although there appears to be no evidence for this. Yeah. I don't even give it time of. Day, do you know. Right, well done. Doesn't. Doesn't affect me whatsoever. As long as he does his job well. Yep. And what's she doing at the moment? Presenting dog eat dog, I think. Right. You know, as long as she does. As long as they both do their jobs well. Yeah. At the end of the day, that's going on with a lot of people out in the world, isn't it? Do you know? I mean, just because he's an England boss, as long as, you know, we win the. Win the games and that he's doing his job, if she's, you know, gets a dog, winning the prize or whatever. No. Okay. It's not going. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. So. I haven't seen dog eat dog. Okay. It's all right. It's. It. Yeah. It doesn't matter. Okay. What about this, then? Are you disappointed by the nation that a third of us are apparently unaware of St. George's Day? 23Rd is St. George's Day. The one with the snakes that we've talked about now, that's. Are you one of that third. Do you think St. George is the. Patriot of England who killed the dragon? Yeah. I mean, there's too many of these days, and they. That's the problem. If you make it a bit more special, like Christmas, so you buy presents and that for each other, then people will remember it. But there's so many these days with Easter and pancake Tuesday and all that. So it's not surprising. I think, as time goes on, we'll find that a lot of these days will just disappear because, you know, people are busy. There'd be new ones, weren't there? I don't know. People. There'd be like, Gareth Gates day in 50 years time. It's just weird. I mean, I remember being a kid, right, going out on a Sunday and shops will be short because it was like, you know, the day arrest and all that. People don't care now. It's like, well, we can make some more money. We'll open the shops. Yeah. Is that a good or a bad thing? It's good. Because I remember I used to have to get up early to go and get some bread if we didn't have any in, because the shop would only be open for a couple of hours in the morning, whereas now I'd be able to. I remember that shops and you couldn't get aspirin and stuff. Certain things on a Sunday afternoon. Yeah. Yeah. So. That's right, yeah. And pubs. Denominator. Remember space operas? Yeah. Yeah. Shut up. Can I ask you something? Okay. I've got a little list of things. What do you think of, like, those pug dogs that are bred and they can hardly breathe? Evil. Yeah. What do you think of guys? They're all right. I mean, just like straight people. You get bad ones, you get good ones. Exactly. Listen to that. Absolutely. Let's play a record. Yeah. What do you fancy about a radio head? Yeah. You don't mind, though, if people think we're gay? For instance, when we go to the Baptist. No, that's terrible. I don't want that. Why? Hey, why not? That'd be a lie. I don't like lying. If I was, I'd say I was gay. Yeah, but I'm not. We'll say you. I just pretend we won't get in otherwise. No, just a little kiss in the cuddle. Sam. I'm a bit gay. No. Come on, gang. On XFM 104.9. Wow. Near the end of the show, innit? You had a good time, Carl? It's been all right. I knew it wasn't going to be a belter today. Good boy. What do you mean? What's up with it? Because what happens to the last two weeks have been quite good and we always tend to have two good ones and then one that's just. All right, well, let the listening public be the judge of that. Well, yeah. And the Sony committee. Yeah. What do you want to do? A clip show of the best. We should do that for our last show. People should vote for their favorite hilarious link and then we can put it together on a tape. Right. Is there a record? I want to release the bit like. I love, including such favorites as do you like gays? And this lady had a horse. Yeah. Oh, I scored once. I was stung by B and who could. That's lovely. Do you do that? Can you. Have you kept all these on tape? Yeah. So can you do a compilation? People phone in? No, this the next two weeks, phone in for your favorite clip. How can they get hold of you, Carl, in the week? What's your direct email? What's your email? My name with Xfm dot co dot Uk. So, Carl Pilkington. Carl dot Pilkington. Carl with a k. Carl with a k, yeah. Carl dot Pilkington at XFM dot co dot Uk. Vote your favorite link of the last three months. We should make a little compilation and sell it and we get like Radiohead. They'd love. They'd love to be at the compilation with us, wouldn't they? But me. Oh, anyway, yeah, right. Do you know, like, you're always giving me questions in the week? You're always saying things like, if I put you in this situation, what would you do? Like what? Like what? Bizarre things. Like what, though? Say one. If you had to lick Barbara Cartland's face. Yeah. Would it be the right cheek or the left cheek? Sorry? Does Barbara want her face being licked? I was just saying if she. If that's what she's into, then I don't mind. She said, yeah. So I don't think she'd be careful. Because you can't libel the dead. So I make sure she's dead before we start saying horrendous things. I don't think she is dead. I almost certainly she's not. I don't think so. No, she's not phony. If Barbara Carton dead, zero 8700-800-1234 off. To get Chris in. So listen, right? So anyway, he always calls up with, like, bizarre, bizarre stuff like that. And I was watching a program the other night about snakes, right? And it was like, don't walk through a river that's full of snakes because. Good work, good advice. They. If you got a kid in the car or in the house, turn your radio down if you don't want them to hear stuff like this. But yeah, they go for your tackle. Why? I don't know. They just do. They think it's another little snake, maybe with swollen cheeks. Yeah. Or an anaconda in my case, with one eye. I'm really joking. So, yeah. And I said to Ricky, what would you do? It's very scaly. You two in the woods, you're having a wandy. Steve having a wander. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You walk through the river. What, me? Yeah. Okay. Because you're tall. So it's like you can check out how deep it is before Ricky goes through. Right. Which you do. You do do that sometimes, don't you? Yeah. But a snake bites your tackle. Yeah. Yeah. And say penis. Yeah. It's the correct word for it. It doesn't sound like. Say it. Say. Say it. Penis. But I don't know. You dirty little. You dirty little slut. Carl, you a dirty little words. Right, carry on with the. Let's carry on. What's the story? I'm wandering through a river. Yeah. And the snake bites you. Penis. You know. You know, Ricky, like, doesn't leave, like, wc one. Why on earth we're going to be anywhere near a river where there's sort of. Well, anyway, anyway, yeah. You are in this situation. Yeah. The snake bites you. And I said to Ricky, if it was a matter of life or death, would you suck out the poison? What do you think he said? And the bit I made, because he was thinking about it like, oh, God. Well, he's, you know, he's my best mate and everything. What will I do? And I said, and then Steve starts sort of groaning like he's enjoying it. I'm just trying to remember what I did do, what did happen in that instant. Okay, um, so, so I've been, I've been bitten on the penis by a snake. Yeah. There's poison in. There's no poison in it. Yeah. I've had a go at trying to suck out myself. Yeah, yeah, but you've never mastered that. Yeah. Yeah. It's just such a long spine and such a short, stubby knob that he's got no chance. Yeah. So, um. So I have to get. He's even had lip extensions. I mean. Yeah. Yeah. God, and I. And would Ricky suck it out? Almost certainly not. Yeah, that's the answer. He'd let me die. He's horrible. I'd go, is there anyone you want to tell? Join me to call your mum and dad. Yeah. How should I tell him you died? They tell him I died taking a bullet for a lady. Yeah. Yeah, I was. I was. I was beating up some. Yeah, some nasty people. Yeah. Would you at least run into the woods and try and find some kind of animal that could do it for me? I'm. Some of those monkeys look like they got, you know, they got a good technique. Right. Stop it. One more song. Yeah. Only time for song for the whats it. Oh, we got to share this one, then. But we're doing this one. There was two. We've run out of time. Well, this is for this in the Guardian because they print. My favorite song is if you see a sailor. It's if you see a. Say hello. Okay. A song for the ladies and lovers. All right, that's it. And I can't believe we weren't allowed to talk about monkeys giving blowjobs. Since when is that taboo? It's nature, Carl. They go absolutely mental. They love it.",
