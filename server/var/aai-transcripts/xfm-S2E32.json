  "text": "Placebo. The bitter end on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me is both Stephen Merchant and Carl the Cayman Pilkington. So you've already got that. That's safe. It's only four minutes past. You have placebo and you've got us three. So you're definitely going home with that. That's safe. That's on its way to the hospice. Exactly. You've banked that. Yeah. Now do you want to gamble all that to go on and listen for another 2 hours? Well, you could walk away now and you're up. Yeah, you're up. You're already up. Right. That's really. You have not wasted any time. Do you want to gamble that against another 2 hours? It might be shoddy, it might go downhill, but it might get even better. Carl, what do you say they do listen for the 2 hours? Yeah, see, we shouldn't have done that. We shouldn't have asked Kyle because a lot of them now are already taking what they've got. And what they've got is great, Rick. What they've got is lovely. They're loving that. They're going to enjoy. We have got monkey news. We've got cheap as chimps. That's not the same thing. How many radio stations have got two ape related simian features? Rick, can I point out, a lot of people are making that mistake. A lot of people are thinking that monkey news is exactly the same as cheapest chimps. It's not. Let's keep that clear. It's not. It's in the same ballpark, but it's, it's not. It's not the same. They're involved. They're involved. Yeah. Yeah. We've also got some great music. Yeah. We've got an amusing sketch about a fly and mystic is dropping in the mystique. Ladies are coming in. I want to kick off with a song that is, you know, you got half of those imposing songs that when you sort of like between 40 and 18, they were the ones you'd put on to get ready to go or just pose around or, or be that pop star or think you're on stage or whatever, or in the video. And embarrassingly, I remember I dug this out and I remembered I used to post this like a mother when I was about 14. Right. This is street life by Roxy Music. You used to do. Mine was. Mine was oops, upside your head. Yeah. It was just me on the floor in my bedroom. One day I thought, one day there'll be other people in this imaginary boat. Yeah, yeah. Elbows going everywhere, knocking over vases. But then I remember later it was Black Lacey's superman, which is something similar. Do you remember that? That was brilliant. Spray ski. If you found out there in radio land, got any funny jokes, then call. In because we need some. Street life. Roxy music off the stranded album. That's why I used to jump around to. What would you be wearing while you were listening to that? Well, probably Brutus gold jeans. Classy. Or green flash pumps. Sure. Any socks? I would have had socks. Yeah. I'd have probably been wearing the shirt my mum got me from Tesco's, which was, which was again, a brutus shirt. And it had women in bikinis eating bananas on the chaise. Long. I remember when I was. I meant on holiday about that time. And I thought in my. But my older brother had this leather jacket and I was on the. I was on the beach just, you know, in shorts and that. And I went to get an ice cream or something. I said, can I borrow a jacket? And I put his jacket on and I was frozen on the beach thinking they are all looking at me because I look so good. And I also had a straw stetson. And I really thought, yeah, I'm turning into quite a man. Yes, I'm quite a cat. Yeah. Yeah. Just thinking. Who's that dude? Is he american? Is it. Hold on. Is he. Has he just come from some sort of rodeo? Wait a minute. I'm in a bikini and I like bananas. I could be the woman for him. Didn't you have the t shirt or jackets at you water university? That was pretty classy. Didn't have like some. Some foul language on it or something. What was that? Yeah, I had. When I was this when I was 18. Right. The Christmas, although the birthday before I went to university. Got two sweatshirts, one black, one red. Had bullshit on them. Just done the fab and the red one. All my clothes, the first wash, everything was pink. All my white shirts and my white socks, of course, because I just put it. I didn't know. Yeah, yeah. So. So that I was a man at university with all pink clothes except for a rather nice red sweatshirt with bullshit on it. So again, turning into quite a man. Was that pre or post the time you washed your clothes by getting in the bath? And that was pre. That was the second year when I was in dad to go and dig. So I had a bath and you had to sort of like pay for a bath, you know. So I thought, two birds of 1 st. I got in the bath with all my white shirts, because I was going through sort of, you know, wearing a white shirt and tie, that sort of David Sylvian sort of fire and everything. And Daz and I just wriggled around in it, washed myself. It's quite a good exfoliate. So, yeah, I didn't do it again because it was not good for the skin. Quite sore, is it, around? So there you go. Roxy Music and street life. Carl thought I just was just was working out time, really. Just. We've got. Well, last week we had a lot of stuff that we didn't manage to cram in, which was good. So I'm just looking at. We've got. We have got cheapest chimps coming. Songs. A phrase. Oh, why don't we kick off with. That so we don't forget it. Cheapest chimps or songs. Afraid so. The film thing. We did a film done. Yeah. We've also got a new feature, cheeky freak of the week. Incidentally, I should just point out now that someone is. Ashley Phillips has emailed in, because obviously with songs of phrase, what Carl does, for those who have not heard it, he takes a phrase that you might hear commonly on the show and then. He uses airy chinese kid. You never seen an old bloke in a ma. And as I say, he uses different chunks of songs and he makes up that phrase. And so he has made some suggestions here, Carl, because he thinks that the more common Carl, you're an idiot, fool, etcetera. Perhaps a little overheard. He'd like to maybe hear Carl Paul's. I don't know where to start. Which is a common one from Ricky. Carl, which bit of that do you actually think is true? And then there's the regular dialogue between the three of us. Carl. Well, you know, it could happen. Me. Sure, sure. Ricky. No, no, no, Carl, it could never happen. Not now, not ever. You're an idiot. Player record. So maybe some of those you could use. Will we get it going then today? This week, we're. Do you remember the story about me Auntie having wind for five minutes? Was it your Auntie Nora? Auntie Nora. She was on a lot of medication and stuff and I think that's a side effect that comes with it. So, yeah, she had wind for five minutes, so I thought we'd dig that one out. A classic line. Me auntie had wind for five minutes. Okay, so I've got loads of songs here. How many is that? Me auntie? Add wind. Four, five minutes, seven tracks. That's tricky. Okay, so you need to identify if you can be bothered, the artists. That's what we're after, isn't it? All right. Okay. Just remember as many as you can get because the winner would probably be, you know, who gets five or something. So don't worry if you. There's a couple you can't get because you could still probably win. Go on. Can I just. What's the email address? It's, well, if they go to XFM dot co dot UK, Ricky, they can just send them through there and send. Them through that way. Which of these is the prize bag? That's the one, is it, Karl? All right, so let's see what hot treats you could win as I get them out. Carl, do you want to play it once more? I recognize all them except one. Right, let me see what we got here. Once again, Carl, you excelled yourself with an arbitrary collection of DVD's just hanging around. Were they just hanging around again? I'm always interested to know which of our XFM listeners has tastes as broad as this. Go on. We've got the recent BBC adaptation of the hand of the Baskervilles. Brilliant. Okay, very nice. We've got. What's this? Is this the, this is something involving air? The band air. I think it's a single at best. Yeah, this is probably worth having. This is the current Flaming Lips album, so you've excelled yourself there. Actually, Carl, that's not bad. An XFM mouse mat. They're as common as mutt. Hold on, you can't give away that mouse mat. It's a piece of foam. Now I was going to dismiss the oddball Sci-Fi movie capacs featuring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges, but, Carl, is it. So that. So win that and put on eBay. For four pounds 50 and man alive. What is that? Just look at their faces. No, Carl, don't give that. No one wants that unless it's ironic. Series one and two on DVD of popular northern basic on bread. Buy it, sell it. The game's getting hard. Cause someone's dealing you a losing card. They all had to go. All the actors had a line on that song. Oh, play the clips again. Play the clips again. I really want to win it now. Here we go. I can't believe this hasn't been done before. It's extraordinary because most of our ideas have. Lucky man on XFM 104.9, Lucky Gervais, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. The emails I should point out aren't flooding in on nobody always takes time. When they go through the website. Does it, yeah. So they'll be arriving in a bit. Do you want to play it once more for those that just joined us? All right then. Brilliant. My auntie had wind for five minutes. Brilliant. Mainly artists, Rick. I sometimes get off at the tube at Tottenham Court Road if I want to look at the record shops before I come into XFM. And I always cut through Chinatown. Oh, yeah. And every time I come through Chinatown, the same thought always strikes me. I always feel like I want to just gather all the little locals, all the little chinese fellows, just gather them around and just go, guys, in what way is this a town? It's nice. This is not, at best, what you've got here is a novelty street. Yeah. Gerrard street is not a town. No. It's not a town. You've had. Yeah, yeah. You can't just call it Chinatown and claim it to town. If I was then, though, and used to do, I'd go, I go, what is a town? It is a town. It is a town. It's our town. We got all. Lots of. Where's your. Where's your church? Where's your mayor? We needed. We got a. Got a betting shop. Not enough. It is. See, what? All you've got here is restaurants. No, that's. That's not. No, no, no. Got a little supermarket with snacks. What does it sell? Snacks specifically, I would imagine crackers. Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to buy a dragon? Do you want to buy an ornamental dragon? If I. If I wanted to buy one. This is where I buy. Do you want to buy a gold dragon? Is it made of gold? No, it's made of plastic, but it's sprayed gold. Do you want to buy that? It's not a town. It is not a town. Yeah. And I annoyed me because when I first came to London, I genuinely thought Chinatown was going to be this amazing. Like, you know, like, what they've got there is. You'd hear a gong and. Yeah, we went in there and there'd. Be rickshaws and people walking on those little sort of wooden shoes. They're brilliant. They are just comping around in them. But nothing. It's nothing. Just. Yeah, exactly. It just reminds me of. Have you ever been to any of those sort of museums? You tend to have them up north where they've got, like, you've got. You sort of sit in a little car and it sort of rides you through, kind of. I don't know, it might be Newcastle, victorian era. Could I have a half a pound of those sweets? Of course you can. If there were some animatronic men, it would just be an. An exhibit. Yeah. Their concession would have been 100 years ago is there's some scales in the shop and there's a horse outside. Yeah, that's it. The traditional sounds and smells of old. England and the voice of going. Of course there was no television. Exactly. Amazing. Amazing. Brilliant. Yeah. Welcome to Chinatown. So it's not. Yeah, it's a good point. Is that a piece of traditional music, chinese music or is that music that someone in this country wrote thinking it sounded like chinese? I think it was the. Was it the vapors, wasn't it? Is that from. Yeah, no, it's, it's that. It's that pentatonic scale, isn't it? What is it called? What's that? It's the black notes on the piano. Well, that's the one I can play along with. Eastenders. Yeah. You know what I don't get with it? Go on. Chinatown. Yeah, Chinatown. Because I always walk through it on the way to work. A couple of things annoy me. First of all, I think it's bad business just because if you've got. If you've got a chinese restaurant, put it somewhere where there isn't any others. It's a good point. Yeah. But it's also a community. They're not just a theme park for other people. I ended up, I remember going out one night with Suzanne, some friends, and you got there and there's so much choice. It's that dilemma of. Oh, forget it. Well, not really specifically chinese. Well, no. Why do you go the one with the dead ducks hanging in the window? That's my favorite thing as well. It's like normally you put your good stuff in the window if that's what's in the window. And the other thing that annoys me, walking through today, there's always lard on the floor. What, in the street. It is. Honestly, I'm scared I'm gonna slip over. It's cause all the restaurants and that. But why is it. That's another point. Well, it's not. It's not oozing out of the restaurants. Why is it. Why is it. I don't know what they do. Just careful, listen. No, but why is it. That's why they used to wear those little wooden shoes. Okay, that's. We've got. The thing is as well, they try and wash it with water, which doesn't work with lard. And it's like oil. Famously. Yeah. You know what I mean? Even I know that. Yeah. You gotta scrub it so you think sorted that out? Yeah. You think they'd know, wouldn't you? Yeah. All right. Anyway, thanks for your thoughts on Chinatown, Carl. I'm gonna play this thing again because it is a bit slow today. The email, because it's too hard. It's not too hard. There's just clips, songs, what are the artists email in XFM, he's getting annoyed. Because he's put the work in and no one's getting annoyed. Oh, remember I think Kevin Spacey and the signed Capex DVD is probably the only incentive to try and have a go at that one. Just think, you could win by getting one of them. Exactly. They're coming in now. Okay, this is electronic. Electronic. Getting away with it, definitely. Do you reckon we'll get away with it? You see, you've worried me now. Yeah, I don't know. He's worried me. My apologies if you're offended at all by my reference to those little wooden shoes. Don't worry, that's not gonna help. Rick used to wear. Don't they still wear them? We've only had one complaint, haven't we? What we got that we got from the sony's, that one about talking about the swans penis. But yeah, things like complaints is people complain all the time. It's whether it's upheld because it goes from authority and then they have to go. Oh yeah, look, that was, that was in poor taste or free water or. Some of the things you said on tv, though you must have been stung. Well, for, see, I've only had, again, I've only had one upheld, one serious lap on the wrist for some, I said, but what was he saying? Can you repeat it? Well, I can jet. Yeah. I was talking about, and it was a true story. I was talking about this little old man who is his daughter was taking to home because he used to fry up bacon and rub it round his to get the dog to lick them. Right. And you got complaint. Yeah. And that was it. That's, that's why you got a complaint. Yeah, yeah. What's up with that? Well, he said it on songs of praise. They said it was in poor taste, I suppose. What other complaints? You know the most, you know the biggest complaint ever on tv, the most complaints ever for anything on tv was the showing of the last Temptation of Christ. Yeah. Do you know the second? Yeah. The second was I think Ann Robinson put in the Welsh into room 101. What, cuz she didn't like him or not? Yeah. She just said, well, you know, they're going in there. She said it's slightly more eloquently than that. Yes. Yeah, yeah. I can understand the people or the place. I don't know. I think it was the place and therefore the people. Yeah. What do you mean? Yeah? No, you know, me mum and dad have sort of moved from Manchester side now in Wales. Oh, yeah. And it is. Look at his face turning his nose up. No, but it is pretty depressing, John. Mean, it's just one in places that it's like you go back in time and that when you go there. I mean, maybe the major city is there, maybe Cardiff is all right. What, even coming from Manchester, it's like going back in time. It's just. It's like one of them places it feels like every day is Sunday. Do you know? I mean, it's just depressing and gray and sleepy. Lots of vickers walking around going, I'm late. Well, yeah. Here's the sort of attitude they have, right, this. And this is true because my mum, dad live there and that, right? And they love it. It's all right, it's an healthy place to go when you get older and that. But this. This is why they don't move on in Wales. Well, start to make another sorry to anyone who listening. We're not saying you don't move on. Carl is. No, sorry about the little chinese shoes. The thing is, it's good that in a way, that they do do that and they don't want to be like, you know, rushing about everywhere, because the way London is. Isn't that great either, is it? Because it's totally opposite. Yeah. Right. So I'm not. I'm not having a go. It is a bit dull. I think even people who live there will agree with me. Okay, right. But, like, one of the shops that my mum and dad use, right, it's only a little sort of villagey type shop. Can't be bothered staying open for hours and hours. Right. Because there's not enough people use the shop. Yeah. So what you do is they get used to what you buy. I leave it out. They put it in a phone box outside. They put it in a phone box? Yeah. So it doesn't get wet. So my dad's loving that. Once he found that out, it was like, brilliant. But that. How is that a bad thing? That's brilliant. Well, it's not for other people. It is for me dad, because he's picking up all sorts of stuff. No, he's not. Oh, yeah. He's not nicking other people shopping. Well, it's not like nicking, is it? Cuz he's not theirs yet. And you've stitched him up on radio. Well, of course, because they're gonna think, who's that? Who is there in town with a mank accent? Keeps making phone calls and he's getting fatter. Yeah, that's. I love that your dad was excited when he found out. I can't believe. I can't believe that he's moved there. He's retired to this little village where it's based on trust and community and he is abusing it. He's using his Scally mank ways. Bloody hell. Like us. And there's no bread again. There's old women hungry. Yeah. Cats aren't getting fed. And your father is just. I can't. That's obscene. That's obscene. Oh, I think it's a die thief. That fella from Manchester. Got sky there yet, have they? They can't listen. They won't. They won't know what's. I think you stitched him right up. I hope you have, actually. I hope he goes down for it. I hope he's hanged out of the community like Frankenstein's monster. Yeah. They should get burning torches, go up to the. Set fire to his cottage. Yeah, exactly. He's out of the choir. Has it come to this? Forget about tomorrow feeder. Right, listener, I'm talking to you now. Have you seen these posters around with me and Steve on it? Right. It's embarrassing, right. We were mucking around at a photo session and XFM wanted to do some posts. We couldn't be bothered to do them again, so we let him have this one. Irony comes back to haunt you and it looks like. I think I'm Simon Temple Summer. And Steve's all right, but we think that Carl should be in it. Definitely. Carl doesn't want to be in it, but it looks like everyone listens to this show for. For Carl's basically, you know, innocent stupidity and some great tracks. They don't listen for us anymore, Steve. So I think it should be a campaign to get Carl on the poster. Yeah, well, I should point out that I think XFM are more than happy to have him on the poster. So it's just him. You don't want to be on there, do you? There's no. There's no need for me to be on it. Of course there is. Why not? I've got so many emails here as I'm sat during the show reading them so many miles saying, what does car. Look like for slash? Ricky? We've got those film bits on there. Those video mock ups where I'm part of it, you can sort of. It's not enough, Carl. People want to see your face, that you're part of the show. You're an intrinsic part of the show. Yeah, we get. We'll get you on the poster. Why? It'd be too much on a poster. They can only take in so much. What do you mean? Yeah, it's good with two people. No, it's enough. So what a groups do then? Well, they haven't. It's like. It's like Ringo Starr is being left off the COVID of Sergeant Pepper. Yeah, or Rutherford doesn't get in a look in with Genesis. Exactly. You know, be outrageous. Yeah, I'll say. Oh, sorry, Tony Banks, you can't be in this one. Yeah, it's just me. You will be very. You see, you look like the Colin. So you gotta be photograph that well, either. You're joking. Is it because the shiny little cue ball? Because it just shines off the top. A lot of people as well, I should do. They should dispel the myth. A lot of people think for some reason that you're fat a lot. You'll say, me, is he fat? No, but that's because I haven't got much air. So it looks like me. Ed's big. No, they haven't even seen you. They just think from listening to the show that you're fat. Ask us, you're northern. They think you just eat chips and complain about the weather. Well, complain about the South. I just think you could answer a lot of your critics. But then you see what I don't like about this world. A lot of people judge people on the way they look. Yeah. Oh, like. Yeah. If only more people thought like that, Steve. But Carl, you judge people on the way they look. Yeah, I know. That's what I mean. But I couldn't with me, could I? Cuz I don't know what I look like. What if I was listening to me on the radio? I wouldn't be able to say, oh, he's a, you know, slag me off and that. Cuz I don't know what I look like. And I quite like that. Do you know what I mean? I lost. I don't know what you're talking about. Absolutely not. Just believe me, right. I'm right on this one. It's best if you leave it. Well, we're not gonna leave it. We're gonna get you on the poster. Yeah. I mainly have to see myself on videotape this morning. Oh, you know the animal show. I did the show. I'm doing a video and I did behind the scenes footage and I've got a. You've seen Avenue. I feel a bit of Carl on there, isn't it? Yes. Great. It's lovely. He can't believe he said, is it playing slow? He's so slow. And I come into the office going, all right. That's how you do it as well. I look like I'm looking into a spoon. I'm not happy with it. I just think that if we're willing to. If Ricky's willing to use his celebrity profile for the sake of the show, I'm willing to look like, you know, let's say a fairly handsome kind of cool customer. I think at least, the very least Carly's that you appear on there as well. You could dress up. Are you worried that you'll look the worst out of all three of us? Who am I standing next to? Am I next to Steve? I'm fairly confident. Yeah. I like the way it's so predictable. You pull the string because you know what it is? It's. You pull the string. What are we talking about before? Complex. Oh, yeah. You know, the most complaints ever? The last adaptation of Christ, I haven't seen it. Was it Scorsese? Isn't it smart? Scorsese. And I bought the film, actually, recently because I was intrigued to see it, but I've not actually watched it. But from what I understand, the reason that it was so outrageous is because it has a whole sequence which shows what it would be like if Jesus had lived his life and not martyred himself on the cross, but lived his life as a human being, part of which is him having sex. And so I think that was chiefly what the outrage was, that it was showing this godly man to be, you know, as human as he was supposedly, you know, because he's supposed to be human as well. So that's the reason. That was the reason that there was complaints there. I don't know. I haven't seen the film. You see him. Do you see him having sex? I think, yes. Although it is an actor, Carl. Jesus Christ. It's not the real. It's not the real Robert Powell. It's an actor playing Robert Powell. You see sex on films and all that, right? When I was growing up watching. No, just. Just saying an example of this, really, when I was growing up as a kid and I'd be, you know, watching films with my dad, right. It'd really be enjoying a film, right? And then a sex scene would happen, right. And he'd go on film, or just. Behind you would happen. Your brother up to his old tricks again. He'd get up and go make a cup of tea. Right? Typhoon. They'd stolen from some sort of telephone box. And, like, even recently ill, he thinks it ruins a film. Do you know? I mean, because there's no need for it to happen, is they, really? Yes. Why? Sometimes it's what it's warranted if the film itself is. Yeah, I think. I think the films that him and his dad watched together on channel five and probably not. Is it only on channel five in your house? Yeah, if you're watching, you know, I don't know, a late night, Friday night, you know, from 1983, illegal briefs. A beautiful lawyer has to defend a man who may be a killer. She falls in love with him. But does she? Does she know the real man? Oh, dear. You know what I mean? No. Lest you forget, of course, that I. Love heat with the bloke that is now in. Go on. You know, of course, I. According to the Internet movie database, I once appeared in one of those films in the film killer image, a canadian film, I believe, from 1989, according to that computer. It's all wrong. It's all wrong. It's all wrong. Of course it is. Yeah. Apparently I was in that and I played the role of Kirk. Was it a porn thing? No, no, no. I think it's just an erotic thriller. All right. I suppose you're in a very small part, though, didn't you? Indeed, yeah, yeah. But no, do you know. I mean, sometimes you don't need to go that far. Say, like in this Jesus program, right. Film. What's it called? The last temptation. You know, what. What's his name? Is it Ralph in the Simpsons? Yes. I draw the kitty cat. It's like talking to that. Yeah. No, but, right. This temptation thing. Right. Do you know, you know, often we don't get that many complaints on the show. We don't get very many complaints. And I think that's either because there's no listeners or b, it's because most people agree with Karl and that tells me. Or they let him off because it's like, you know, you can plead insanity, you can go mental and kill for you where they go, oh, he's a bit back. Was it because, like, they're saying that he was having it away or is it because you saw it? What got the complaints? The complaint was the very suggestion. Suggestion. It was a blasphemous thing, not the fact that you saw an actor's knob. So what about if they just cut it down a bit and you, like, saw the little stable door closing? It wasn't the baby Jesus having sex, it was the grown man. The stable door shutting. Oh, that is brilliant. Then the wise men saying, I can't believe we brought mirror. We should have brought condoms. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. There's two for one offering booth. I don't know what we were thinking with frankincense. It's just that it's always. Should we apologize now to the christian church as well? So little chinese fellas, little welsh fellas, and the little christian fellas haven't said anything wrong? No, it's like, you see. That in Carl's world, he was born in a stable. Just thought, well, I love this place. I'm just gonna stay here the rest of my day. This is good here. Oh, when I was watching teller with me mum and dad, I mean, it still happens now, right? My dad's will sort of go off. Ruined. Good film ruined. If some sex scene happens. But what are we talking about? Sex scene? Are we talking about kissing? Are we talking about penetration? Then look at the camera going, you enjoy this. Pilkington's. What are we talking about? What is sort of extreme levels we talking about? Last time I was down there, right, yeah. What was it? Meet me, Joe. Meet Joe Black. Meet Joe Black is a terrible film. Yeah, there was good film and then, you know it's gonna happen because, like, the music comes in, Brad Pitt's keeping quiet, a woman's eyeing him up. Sure. So my mom's. My mum's worked out already and she's going, anything on the other side, love? She knows. She knows. She knows it's, you know, something's. And so you can be enjoying a film and you can be an hour and ten in and then some spidey senses of one of them can go, she will turn it over and the other one goes, yeah, right. Are you sure it's not them protecting you from scenes of sex so that they're. What they're thinking is, what if Carl gets the idea to have sex? Yeah, that could lead to procreation. We don't want any more like him. We've got to. We've got to end the line here. Sure it's not the doctor keep calling out, going, you are keeping away from women, aren't you? He must never find. Sure they're not embarrassed because they're watching sex in their son. It happens. Or every time. Right? There's two things that my mum does, right? It's that if this sex scene on the telly, she'll go, you know, anything on the other side, love. And the other thing, she always says, if ever there's anything on the telly with Elvis in it. Yeah. She goes, oh, I like him. Right? And we all know. We sat there. We know what she's gonna say next. Yeah. So you don't even bother saying why, right? And she goes, he liked fat, ugly people. He what? He liked fat, ugly people. He didn't always go for, like, the good looking fans in the crowd, what Elvis did. Yeah, right. That was always the thing. And I'm sorry. No, hold on. I don't know what we're doing now with our lives, Steve. Wait a minute. Right? So your mum says two things, right? She either says, is there anything else? Or, I like Elvis. There's a pause. Because you know what she's gonna say next? She says, he liked fat, ugly people. How often does this occur? Well, because they've got, like, you know, sky. There's a lot of those channels on. They like the music channels. So Elvis always comes on. There's either an Elvis film. There's like, you know, a classic hit by him on. And she a girl. I like, how is he like ugly people? And what do you mean he liked fat, ugly people? Because he's that special Vegas show in the. Where he's dancing about, right? And he's got loads of scarves around his neck. Towels. Yeah. And like, he always hands them down to the fat, ugly ones. And I always say it's because they're the fat, you know, got a sweaty face because they can't, you know, I mean. And what do you mean fat, ugly ones? You mean they're in the front? They're sweating a lot because they're a bit. She thinks, you know, it's giving them. A towel because he's really going, wipe your face. You're putting me off, you fat cow. Stop sweating near me. There's another one. What? So airy chinese kids. Yeah. Jesus. We haven't slagged off airy chinese kids. We slagged off chinese. We didn't slag anyone off. We just said they really haven't got a town as such. And they wear shoes. What do we say? And what the way? I just don't know. We got this. And big, fat, ugly women. I don't know where we. I don't know how we. Did you see that? Fat girls and feeders. Hey, what's on? Patty first. Oh, brilliant. It's great. Song break down how many of the. Radio shows have talked about last temptation of Christ, Chinatown, ugly women, 60 minutes. Exactly. Incredible. Sony award winning. Cheering breaks painkiller on XFM 104.9 Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington. I should point out now, Rick, that the general consensus from the, the listeners is that car should definitely be on the post. I love to see Carl on the, on the poster, especially as I'm watching him on the webcam today and wearing that shirt. Doesn't he look like Charlie Brown? He looks just like Charlie Brown from the DNS cartoon. Oh my God, that's it. From now on, if anyone ever asks me, what does it like? Charlie Brown? Oh, it's great because Charlie Brown has got that thing. You've got less features than morphe. It's just a round head and there's human aspects. It's just the bare minimum. When I draw a cartoon of him, it's so easy. Yeah. Ah, the thing is, right, if I go on the poster, this is what I'm worried about. Where do you go from there? What do you mean? Do you know, like before, you were talking about the complaint that a tv channel got about some fella putting bacon. Yeah. Yeah, that was me. Yeah. Yeah. You were talking about. I didn't put the bacon on me. Yeah, I was talking about it and they got a complaint. Yeah. Right. Now he had to do that to get a kick. Yeah. Yeah. Where do you go from there? And it's the same for me on a poster once have seen me. Yeah. And we get sued by the estate of Charles M. Schultz without copyright. Most popular creation. It's just that if people don't know it keeps them interested. They don't need. They're not tuning in every week on the off chance that we'll. They're wondering what you look like. Yeah. But the ones who are. It just keeps them. They won't let them down there when they see your picture. It won't let them down. It won't be a letdown. It's exactly as it should be. Competition. Yeah. Right. Let's get the answers. Let's get this out of the way. Songs of phrase songs. A phrase. Just in case you just tuned in. It's a new feature we've been doing. We take songs and chop them up and that. And it's a phrase that's crops up on the show. A few times this week we were going back to the classic. Me auntie had win for five minutes. Let's have a. So what you have. There is. You had the knack. Yeah, with my memo. My Sharona Auntie was some Manson track. What? You don't even know what it was, Auntie. Everything. I think it's called some album track. Right. Then you add Bill Medley, Jennifer Warnes. I have had the time of my life. You add Bob Dylan. Wind blowing in the wind. I'll blow in the wind. Was it. What was after that four? Four was 24681 Robinson. Tom Robinson. Yeah, that was a four. Then you had the five from Manfred map. Manfred man, 5321. We wrapped it up with a bit of five star minute. Something about can't wait. Yeah, can't wait. Can't wait another minute. So they're the answers. Yeah, we're looking for someone. Who? I don't think we got anyone who had them. All right, nobody got all seven. Although in your little answer list, then, you only listed six because you got. Your numbers went out of sync in your own brain. Well done. Once again, smooth. I tell you what, Carl, why don't you, next week, at least write down the answers for yourself? Don't need to. Well, you clearly do. You don't need to. You prove that you do. Well done. I'm going to give it to Paul Tier, PJ T o. Because he got five of the seven. Well done. So he gets. And he's getting that signed. Kevin Spacey. Yeah. You can just email us your address as well and get them off to you today. All right. Brilliant. That's what you're dealing with. So you've done that. You've done that competition that's been put to bed. Let's have a great tune, Rick. And then what else we got? We got some monkey news. We got some monkey news. We've got cheapest chimps. We're doing the film thing, right? Got the film thing. What film is it this week? Silence of the Lambs. You can be owning that by 03:00 on vhs. Is it about 499? Is it thereabouts? 20Th century boy. Come on, Mark. Some people want a 21st century boy these days. Mark Bowden there. A little bit out of date on XFM 104.9. Steve Merchant. Karl Pilkington. Right. It's that time again, isn't it? Monkey news. Sure, monkey. Monkey news. If you're a new listener, this is where we do a bit of monkey news. Oh, imagine him giving his chance on a news program like news Night review or news at 10:00. Over to Carl Pilkington. Yeah, all right. Monkey's gone mad again. Go on. Right, we've done quite a lot of good stuff. The one that sort of picked up most of the fuss was probably ollie the monkey. I love the fact that they're all monkeys. He's a chimpanzee. He's an ape. Well, today, right, we're looking at one that's called Coco. Oh, yeah. The one that's a sign language one. Well, what I've read about him is he speaks. Right. Highly educated. Yeah. Photographer. Carl. Carl. I love the fact that when he gets a, you know, a gifted ape, he has to look up to him. He realises that he is superior. I love that. Oh, and it also likes going on computer chat rooms. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna be sick. Oh, gosh. Right. That's pretty amazing. An infinite number of monkeys, or in an infinite number of chat rooms, they'll eventually type. Which is your favorite episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Exactly. Yeah. Carl Wilkinson. You're an idiot. But the thing is, right, you're saying about the infinite thing again about monkeys. If you put them in a room with a typewriter, they'll come up with Shakespeare. Yeah. I'd sort of agree with that. Right. With monkeys who can't do other stuff. But this one, I reckon's gonna be busy taking pictures and stuff. Yeah, yeah. I think monkeys that are boring. Is there a boring monkey? Is there. Would you ever have a chimp and you'd go, it, Suzanne would go, I've got your birthday present. It's a chimp. It's a chimp fella. He's about, you know, about a sort of like a middle aged chimp. No, I'd love it. I'm talking. Would you ever go, I'll tell you what, Suzanne, that one's boring. No, no, but I bet the monkey would get bored. I mean. Do you know what I mean? The monkey would be bored. I'd be loving it. I'd love to have a little monkey. Right. But what I'm saying is you really wouldn't. Yeah. The camera. Be happy again, wouldn't you? Well, yeah, but that's just it. You wouldn't get into. It's like, if you can do other stuff, you don't want to do the boring stuff. Forget the typing. Forget the monkeys typing. Talk about this monkey that's a photographer. What you doing? Are, in a way, I'm just saying that that would be happier. Monkeys that have got nothing else to do, if they can't set pictures and that, and they can't go on chatrooms. They'Re happy to sit in a room, typing away. Typing away? Yeah. Do you know he's got maybe a little exhibition to put on. Do you think. Do you know most. Do you know that most chimps and apes and monkeys still actually just live in trees? These are in laboratories and zoos and things, you know, that's not the norm, these. These monkeys. Yeah. Walking around sort of chatting and riding bikes. Yeah. That's not natural. No, I know. But if you left a bike in the jungle and then came back a few years, there wouldn't be monkeys riding around on it. And a book. If you left a bike with a book in the basket, right, and you went away for ten years and you came back, there wouldn't be a whole new transport system. And schools, they'd eat it. They throw it around and eat it. All right, then. So what you're saying is you can't. You see what I think is right and don't set this the wrong way in that. Right. Stephen Orkin. Yes. Right. Now, he had a bad illness. Now, I wonder if he'd be. I wonder if he'd be as bright as he is if he didn't have that. Right. Because he's had time to sit down. He's like, well, what can I do? Yeah. Go and give him a book and he read it. I like that. Give us another one. Yes. He's got a lot of time on his hands. Yes. Now, what I'm saying is monkeys. Right. They. That. This one, a coco, which I think was a gorilla. Right, right. That wouldn't have been happy on a little keyboard just doing that all day because it'd be going well. I could be out taking pictures. Sure. Play a record. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Play a record. Yeah. Done. You an idiot. There it was. There's the catchphrase once more. He is. He's an idiot. Sure, sure. Athlete. El Salvador on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, the amazing Steve merchant and the incredible Carl Pilkington. All right. Right. We've done that. Monkey news. Right. Straight. Let's. Let's hit them dead. Let's go straight with cheapest chimps, Carl. Right, well, this, this, this will probably finish today, to be honest. What if we looked at it cheapest. Chimps, we found out they weren't banana. Next. Go on, do this one. Yeah, that's it. So what, it was a long running feature. Go on. Well, sorry, can I just ask again, what are the rules with cheapest chimps? It's just, you know, if you wanted a chimp. How much would it sort of cost you? Brilliant title come first. So yeah, yeah, as always, that's the way they do it. Right, cheap as chimps. I thought I'll go online and see, you know, if I could buy one. How much do you reckon? 6000 pounds. To buy a chimp. I know, ridiculous amount. Where can you buy them? From what sources? You shouldn't be able to buy them. Ebay. Buy a chimp from who? There was, this website was selling stuff. What you could actually. What are you talking, what are you talking about? Right, here we go then. Right, I looked at it, here's some of the other animals that were on there. No, no, wait, wait. Are these poachers? I don't know. What the zoos that got bored with them. What? Where can you buy a chimp? I don't want to give it a plug. Right, go then. Right, what are the other animals available? Right, well I'll give you some prices with the other animals then you can try and work out if it's cheap as chimps. Right, so, uh, right, a camel, what do you reckon? Uh, 25,000 pounds. $8,000 for a camel. Right. Sloth, 40 quid, $3,000. Right, last one, Bengal tiger. Oh that's gotta be pricey. $12,000. $1,800. Yeah. Carl, this is an awful website. That can't be true, mate. That's awful. A chimp. Well I. $1,000, I'm gonna go with $1,000. 55,000. What? Yeah. That doesn't make sense. It's mad in it. Yeah, so I don't know what, I don't know what to say because this is rubbish anyway. What's website can you buy? Okay, get me a tiger. Here's a grand. Give me a tiger. Well, I don't know. You're an idiot. Postage and package isn't. Sorry. So where does the cheapest chimps element come in? Well that's. Aren't you supposed to show it's cheapest chimps at the end? Well it isn't. That's why I want to finish the feature. I don't know. What is it? Oh this is amazing. This is amazing broadcasting. So we're up for a Sony award, aren't we? Okay, I hope they're listening cuz it's ours. Yeah, I mean it must. With features like cheapest chips is ending because they're not. It's in the back. And you remember, do you remember his athlete can't stop the red hot chili peppers? I've got news for you boys. I don't want to stop here. I love your funk rock fusion. Word of warning, no need nudity, repeat. No nudity at this gig. I do it like you. I think you should host old show like that. It's lovely that. So have you ever done any, like, DJ, like proper dj, like in a pub or a club? Because I know I had my own disco when I was a kid. Yeah, not proper. I had a gig once when I. It was two nights a week in the local pub. Just the two decks that. It was in a suitcase, you know, that's those sort of all in one thing. And they just wanted the same records. They wanted Ross Stewart, baby Jane. They wanted about quarter to eleven when they were drunk. They wanted Don McLean's american pie, which they all sang along to uptown girl they liked. Right? Yeah. I didn't used to do the talk. I don't understand it. I just love those, those wedding sort of dj's that they have to give you extra information. They can't just play a song, they have to say things like, oh, all the way back there in the commodore. It's sort of like they have to tell you something. Who's listening? They're just going to play the next record. It's a wedding. Yeah. This idea that what, there's like a kind of. There's like the controller of a local radio station listening. It just happens to be at the wedding thinking, hang on, hold on, he's. Played a record but he's got extra information. Well, I should do useful things at a wedding like will the overweight aunt in the purple dress please now take the floor with little unfortunate kid and let him hop around. As the dance floor is currently empty, will any eight year old boys wearing those tiny tuxedos please slide across the dance floor on their knees until they are taken home and put to bed early. I went to, went to one once and the bloke who'd hired it was a DJ, and this DJ that come with this sort of party wanted a seventies disco and he looked like Woody Allen, right? And I was sure he used to be a gentleman's outfit as like. And he said, oh, I wanted a seventies disco. And he went, well, I got bicycle race by queen lined up, I got eloquent and I've got Cliff where you don't talk anymore. So. And he went, well, I went, sort of more disco. He went, I don't really want to blow all my earth, wind and fire before ten, but it's like, oh, please, there are rules. Will the 17 year old girl who's dressed like Avril Lavigne please tut loudly? Because I still haven't played anything by linking park. Will the 45 year old woman, recently divorced, please cry now. Please cry now. Please cry now, because it's clear you're never going to find another man. Because you used to be a dj, didn't you? Because there is a sort of rule. Definitely. I remember there was like. You know, what I learned was that you. There are certain tunes you just do not play early on. Oh, what a night. For instance, people, you never played that before. Like eleven. You want that last hour before they got to go home to be non stop dancing. When would you pop on Dancing Queen? Interesting. Thanks for that. Is there a buffet being served? Yes. Yeah, well, definitely post buffet. I remember there was class. It was great days. I was reminded this recently by ITV's reborn in the USA. There was a great time where you could come out of the buffet or any kind of speech with a bit of Gina G. I remember there was a great period for a couple of years where that was always a barnstormer. Sure. What about. I mean, because the dangers, of course, you go back to the seventies, maybe you got dancing queen, but how many do you play before you come into the eighties with perhaps Billie Jean or soft sal? Soft sound is always a classic. Yeah, I'd love to hear that. And because there's always controversy now as to whether love Shack is overplayed. I know that's a big discussion. I've never liked it. I just like. Will any 35 year old men please now dance ironically to bombastic in the vain hope that someone would actually find them attractive? Oh, no. Never liked. I never. I never. Yeah, all right. I just never liked any records that with a hint of novelty about them. They are popular, though. They're floor fillers. I hate them. I just. Exactly, yeah. Have you? Yeah. You didn't play Dex as midnight runners, probably, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I didn't plan it out that much. When I did it, it was like I knew I had the tights and cigars to give away. Yes. Which he stole from his parents bedroom beforehand. Why were you giving away stuff at a disco anyway? Why aren't you just playing records? Because people liked it, didn't they? If it wasn't, it hasn't changed. We're doing this, we talk rubbish, we play records and we give away crap that we found. Yeah, it hasn't changed, has it? And had some good times. I mean, people haven't been listening all the time. It was called pilkies making music. Yeah, Pilkington. And my mate was called something making. And the music is what we played. And they had some cards made, some nice blue glossy cards made. But they were quite expensive. Yeah. So I used to hand them out and then they say, cheers for that and say, no, write it down. Write the number down. I want that back. Yeah, brilliant. Because they were quite pricey. Yeah. Classy. Classy businessman there made. I think Richard Branson used to do that. I think so, yeah. Saved a bit of money because my dad made some, um, some lights on me. He just, like. He said, he made him. He found him in a telephone box. People were making phone calls in the dark around the neighborhood. Exactly. It was just white bulbs in, like, a box. And, like me mate making, he used to just flick them on and off, other thing, and then they'd be in town with the music and that. Perfect. I love that. We got a lot. We got our sound to light system. What's his name? Colin. Yeah. Brilliant, right. So did you ever rent him out? Well, we never had any disasters, right. But we mate did one. Right. I don't know if it's that funny, really, but it go tell you anyway, right, we. He was doing this gig and it was probably one of the biggest gigs, right, that he ever had. Must have been a couple of hundred people. Yeah. And in like a big sort of warehouse thing. Anyway, for some reason, there was some problem with a big speaker that fell, right? So the police turn up and stuff, right? And they try to control the night and they're going, can everyone sit down? Can we try to control it? Can you sit down? So now you get a few, like, little groups of people sitting down on the floor and people were still stood up and the police were saying, look, you know, we're gonna cancel this whole night if you don't all sit down. And more and more people are sort of sitting down. It's going on for about 20 odd minutes, right, will you please sit down? And it gets to this point when there's just one lad stood up in the middle and he's going, look, you're ruining it for everyone, will you sit down? And it goes quiet for a bit and someone's muttering something and he goes, ah, the lad standing up has got calipers on his legs. Can we have a round of applause. For the kid who said that? It was this lady who was doing the DJ. He was the DJ. So, like, they kept the police and everything was saying, well, you sit down. You're ruining it for everyone else, dear. You know the quick way to sort that would have been. Most of mine where I had good nights. Yeah. Always got reeboks and stuff. And I had a bunch of venture. Scouts, went mental once. Had a food fight. What was it adventure scouts for? Well, we did. We got booked by everyone, Rick. We. I mean we started with weddings and local, you know, things, but we soon went up. We were. I mean, at one point we played a massive gig in a big tent in the middle nowhere for some scouts and they actually loved us raging against the machine. Oh, they couldn't leave their luck. Do you know when they say weddings and bar mitzvahs, do they get a lot of discos playing bar mitzvahs? It is a big. I don't know what happens at a bar mitzvah. Well, I've not, I've not never been. To someone phone, phone in. If you add a little bar mitzvah, tell me what it was like. What sort of. What do you play bar mitzvah. Don't know what the occasion is really. It's becoming a man in it. Yeah. All right. We learned something when we carlton to phone in. Yeah, do we. I want to know if that. If they have really do have dj's at bar mitzvahs. All right. Oh wait, how interested are you in there? Well, you know, I don't embarrass myself one day. Sure. And let's see, it's Carl you gotta learn on. Yeah, tell you what, have we got time for the film thing as well? Yeah, play the film thing now. No, no no, let's play tune. But kill. Yeah. Forest the cure on XFN 104.9. Wow, brilliant. Someone called in, she's been to a bar mitzvah and they do have apparently a crap disco and apparently, well, Carl asked her what happened. You just sit around and see the kid who's getting bar mitzvah or the man now get given loads of money. Right? And I said, is there a female equivalent? And apparently there is a female equivalent of a bar mitzvah, but she didn't know what it was called. What's that? A Bartitzvah. Right. I'm just going to add to the list of people we've offended. Sorry to jewish people as well. Yeah, we've got so sorry to jewish people. Sorry to chinese people, sorry to welsh. People, ugly fat women. Well, don't put the watching twice. Sorry to Elvis fans. Animal lovers. Animal lovers. Brilliant. Well, lovers of great radio. Yeah, those music lovers. Good well, sorry about that. Apologies to all of you. Thank you. Yeah, and we haven't even had time for, we haven't got time for the film thing this week. Oh, why not? Just, it's running, running tight. Really? Sure. We haven't done cheeky freak of the week. That's a new feature. Cheeky freak of the week. Let's do cheeky freak of the week. What is the cheekiest freak of the week? So I make, I'm just gonna apologize now. Just add freaks. Sorry to freaks. Okay, right. Go ahead. Well, we've, I mean, we've sort, I say it's a new feature, but we've sort of touched on it in the. Past with, we always talk about freaks. Hairy chinese kid. Yeah. We've had the pillow man. Yeah. Are you called a draft excluder? Just make a note that would you rip on. Yeah. People without arms. And. At least you see the pillow man. What do you picture? Because I was saying to Ricky in the week, right, I'm a great fan of the elephant man. That's his. Do you know that's his favorite freak. You know why he said. You know why he said. He said, he said, cuz you get what you pay for when someone says the elephant man. You get what it says on the tin. You know you're gonna get it. Imagine Steve, if you had a mate and, and you said, where you going? He said, I'm going to see my mate. And you go, which mate? And he said, the elephant man. Yeah. Straight away. You haven't even met him. But you know what he's gonna look like. Yes. Right. That's what I like about that airy chinese kid. Yeah. You know. Pillow man. Yeah, not so good. What does that mean? It could be one of those big fat things on that show, couldn't it? A big pillow, like a, you know, big thing about the fat people and feeders. They were getting up to like 60 stone, that big one. And there's, um, there's things called, um, fat admirers that just fancy fat women. Right. And, uh. You're writing that down. Yeah, sorry. Um, and they had blow up versions. It looked like a bouncy castle. Wow. Yeah. Really? Yeah, you could blow. You'd be knackered when you blew that up. You just wouldn't want to go. Forget it. Yeah. Oh, God. People being cruel as well in it. Because after watching the program on channel four about the, you know, the fat people and fellas who like him and stuff, there was a story on one of the news websites about some fella in Germany. Right. It was a big fella. Must have been about 50 stone. And he fell over. Right. And I think he hurt his ankle or something. And timber. They sent firemen instead of like an ambulance. Yeah. So straight away they're having a bit of a laugh. They're not. No, they've got winching gear. Well, they didn't know they didn't have winching gear. They had to use the hose pipes. What, carry him out. I think it was Anna Nova, that news website. They had to use the hose pipe. So they made like a bed using the hose pipes. Oh, yeah. And had to carry him out on that. And then they had to sort of get him into a special truck, they said, and do the same when they got to the hospital. I mean, that's a bit. That's bad, isn't it? They shouldn't do that. Although, Carl, I'm loving that story. I'm just worried that we're not gonna be able to fit in. Cheeky freak of the week. What? Cheeky freak of the week. Something I found on the net. Yeah. Fella who had 27 toes and fingers. In a jar. No, still on him. And proper ones as well. Not like little stumps and that. Proper fully formed fingers, like. Was he a pianist? Close up magician. I don't know what I did. He just said, cats cradle. Professional. Did he ever work on finger bobs? He was saying in the week, for the crowd scenes, I'm now gonna do braveheart. He said about the elephant man, he said, I want to do a thing right with freaks. Well, it's good and bad. He went, what you said the pro about him is, what about the fellow. With loads of fingers or. No, the elephant man. Well, he. He said the bad thing is he stretches his jumpers. When he puts them on. And what's the good thing? Sort of he never gets up and goes, oh, my hair's a bit of a mess today. No, he's always having another bad face day. I don't complain about this. Head and shoulders. Are you taking the piss? Oh, dear. So that's freaky. Didn't you see an elephant woman in Manchester? What do you mean? Leave it? No. Cause it is sad. Oh, that is sad. But I mean, I don't know what my next sentence is. That should be the end. Do they need to say anymore? People will know what she looks like. It's a good name for her. Did she like buns? Oh, it was when me. It's when my dad was a taxi driver. Used to sit in the front. Yeah. And she used to get a lot of taxis and. And he only charged you half price. Indeed. Well, the bad thing is as well, with people like that, you don't want to offend them because they never forget. Oh, go, go, Pilkington. I was in. I was sat in the front of the cab and my dad goes, right, we're going to go and pick the, you know, the. I'm not counting. Tell you the name. These guys just evil. What do you mean? No, leave it. So she's got. No, no, no. Carl, tell me what he said. No, you've already stitched him up. He's Steven things from little welsh fellas, right? What did he call her? Steve.
