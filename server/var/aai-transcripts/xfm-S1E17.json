  "text": "Alfrex Electric, Richard Atkins, Sugar babes. Alex FM 104.9. Steve? Absolutely, I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant. Hello. Carl, the producer. Seven minutes past one of a Saturday. And what a lovely Saturday it is. It is indeed. Well, it looks nice and bright, but it's deceptive because I went out and I just had a t shirt on and I had my jumper on me. I got out there and I thought, this is chilly, I had to pop the jumper on. Oh no, just be careful. If you're just, you know, looking out window thinking, I'll go outside, pop a jumper on or a jacket because it looks nice, but it is a little bit colder than it looks. Rick, can I ask, were you wearing the jump around your waist tied with a knot or did you have it over your shoulders like maybe you just jumped off a yacht? I popped it round my waist and I'll tell you why. I tucked my t shirt in for neatness and comfort. Lovely. But I know even I know that's a little bit dorky. So I was trying to hide the belt line. Okay. Okay. So then I popped the jump on, didn't have to worry about it. So go with the double knot. I didn't, I did, because that can. Loosen if you're not careful, especially if you're carrying bags or you're busy on the tube. I know, but I wouldn't mind that as long as I didn't lose it, as long as I saw it loosen and fall. I pick it up and then clean it. Not in the washing machine though. I pop it in a cold soak. Right. And then leave it out on a few towels or something or pop it over the radiator. So what's the problem with putting it in a hot wash? Well, it can cause shrinkage. Oh no. So coming up, we've got loads of tunes. We're going to be playing them of the best bands around, some new ones, some old ones, might even play, some adamant, we don't know yet. Let's have baddie torn boy though, shall we? Come on. Current single. Badly drawn boy there. Silent sigh. Is that the one with the duck? Yeah. Apparently stopped wearing his hat around because he keeps getting recognized and he's gonna not wear his out when he doesn't want to get recognized. Okay, maybe pop it in the wash. Be careful. Let's just have a kind of a light cold rinse. Yeah, like cold rinse. Soak it. Right, because it's woolen. Right. And then just leave it out on a towel or, you know, maybe in near the immersion heater. Sure. Or over a radiator. Or even a radiator. Is that problem? It can cause that sort of, you know, damaging to the fibers of the wall. He had a kid last week. Did he? Yeah. Who did? Badly drawn boy. All right. Okay. Badly draw a little boy. He's gonna call it honey. Brilliant, Rick. Yeah. Well done. Is satire, money, you, your life. Oh, um. Now. That'S funny. Don't panic, Carl. I'm a professional. Don't worry. What's your concern? Car? What's your concern? Nothing. Tell us. No. You could say you can. This is so unprofessional. It's. What? What have we done? What? Talking about wool? Come on, Carl. What's the problem? What's the problem? You say he's great and he's so scared. I don't know all the ins and outs, so I don't want to get into it. What? The thing. Look, you can't. That people are perplexed. Now. What's that? What's the thing, Carl? What's the thing? What you worried about? Say, is it an email that's been received by the head of. You can talk about. You can tell. I don't understand it. Please know that under a ruling at the Old Bailey, any reference to adamant state of mental illness in any news report will constitute a breach of the ruling and therefore lead to serious action from his lawyers. That's right. And that's true. We can't. We can't do all that. You can play his records and sing his class. Sing songs? Yeah. It's best just to leave it. Yeah. That's what we. Yeah. Carl was a little bit worried. There's no way I was gonna mention that or influence anything. And I totally agree with the law, so that. Don't panic. I should have never been sent to you. Why? Because it's like, you know, accidents happen. Go on it. When things like that happen. Right. You know, you've been told not to mention it. Yeah. And you're like a little kid. Yeah. And once things are in your head. Yeah? It's difficult not to mention it. I mean, when. When I was a kid, yeah. Me mom's sister, Azel, right? We've seen another bloke. It's weird because she's a lesbian now, but anyway, seeing this bloke, and it looked like Ken Dodd, apparently, he did. Like Ken dot, like. So people said, don't mention it because it gets. It gets on his nerves when you. When you'd, like, meet him and you go oh, God, you look like Ken Dodd. So I said, all right, his name is will or whatever. And I was introduced to him, first thing I said, nice to meet you, Ken. Did you do it as a joke or did he? No, no, because I'm not allowed to say that. Yeah, mustn't say that, Ken. And then I saw him. I thought, Jesus does look like him. Came out. Was it Doddy? You turned her into a lesbo, do you think? Well, he wasn't a good looking bloke. So possibly she started going out with Esther ransom then, which is. Which is weird. Out of the frying pan. What started with the lesbianism, then? How did she announce that everyone? What age was she when she realized. Well, I mean, we're not a close family, do you know, I mean, family who keeps in touch with everyone. And I think my mom called her up one Christmas and sort of said, you know, I was, how's the diddy men? Yeah, I was naughty. And she said, oh, no, I don't do that anymore. I'm knocking about with Sandra or whatever. Right. Not big butch Sandra with the big earrings and the skin head. Used to live down the road from you. I don't know. Used to get doc Martens wholesale. That's Sandra. But. But she lived. She had a haunted house. Go on. Who, Sandra? No, Azel. Right. This is before she was a lesbian or not before. Okay. And there's a bike in the hall, and the pedals used to go back. There was a what in the hall? That's handy, isn't it? Oh, that's great. Don't worry, we won't do anything. So sorry. No, there was. I want to know about the haunted house. There was a bike in the hall. There was a bike in the hall and the pedals used to go backwards on their own. And also shoes used to stick to the wall or something. Did they? Yeah, shoes used to stick to the wall. Yeah. Okay, that sounds like her. That's all it does. Hell of a household. Yeah. Oh, dear. Brilliant. Maybe she should clean the walls. Classic. The Lars. And there she goes. What a great start to a show. We've had 20 minutes of some of the best banter, chatter and music and anecdote anywhere on the dial. You're damn right. High five. Oh, what are we talking about? Oh, well, I love that track. It's lovely. They've got a bit of the Liverpool gene pool, haven't they? That sort of doddy, you know, I mean, I like the scouse sort of look, you know, the Scilla black and the Stan Boardman. Yeah. It's sort of happy in teeth and ears. Happy in teeth and ears. Yeah. Brilliant description. Yeah. Happy and teeth and ears. Yeah. That's just three of my friends now. We've got a great track lined up, haven't we, Kyle? I thought in. So I'm gonna go off now. I'm not ashamed. As you know. Me and Steve aren't worried about being part of a trend or. Or, you know, being trendy or jumping on back. Steve particularly doesn't worry about, like, looking good or. No, no. I'm saying that's just compliment. You know, he doesn't worry about walking along like that or, you know, I'm saying, you don't mind the insults, freak boy or goggle eye or swarova ducks back. You know what I mean? Or a new phrase that's been coined because of Steve's face. Water off a frog's back. Who's saying that? Just a lot of. A lot of you. A lot of friends and that. But I mean, my friends. Yeah, a lot of. A lot of the people. Can you name names or. I can't really make promises. You can. I can't. I can't. I think it's the cagal. Looks good. It does look. It's waterproof, Rick. And it's also stylish. I wear nothing underneath, so it's tight to the skin. It gets sticky in bad weather. Is that why you sort of rust? But what. So what's the. What's all the. Is there abuse? What's this? No, no. They just say, because I'm pretty trendy guy. But I. As you say, I cut my own trend. You know, I make my own style. You know, that. Consequently, the pipe. You don't feel that's an affectation? I don't think. I think because you're young and tall. Yeah. The pipe looks a little bit silly. Go on. I mean, I know you're worried about because we've already lost the trilby. Well, I'm worried because pipes are gonna die out. I mean, this is the problem, that there's no young people now who are taking up the pipe as a smoking device. Is there anyone under the age of. What should we say? We said this one before, and I don't think there is. There was no one. Then there was some nutty old woman who phoned in and said, I smoke a pipe. But I'm talking about, you know, because if years ago, it was like an Oxbridge student, you know, you'd be at Cambridge. You'd have a lovely pipe, you know, tweed suit. You'd be there studying. That was. You know. And that was the young, gentle. We smoked a pipe, but no one is there. I'll tell you this. In the year 2050, there'll be no pipes. They won't exist. Well, I think all drugs like nicotine and alcohol be banned. And we won't. We won't be allowed to think our own thoughts. We'll have to live in the sewers. Like eating rat burgers. That's true enough. Weren't we? Yeah. And it would have to download our memories or something. God. And I'll be a rebel, Rick. I'll just. Down there listening to jazz. No, you won't. You'll just have a little chip in the back. And you'll be. You'll be going out with a big fat man with a big toe. Gran. And it'd be. And you'll be. You'll be touching him, but. Well, I think he's a beautiful woman. And I'll be fighting with the. The rebel underground. No, you won't. I will. No, I will. You dead when I. You'll be dead. Yeah. In 2050, you will. I'll be dead. Unless you. Because obviously you're becoming quite wealthy now. You're becoming very rich man. Obviously, from all your, you know, celebrity brain. I'll have my brain brain put into a robot made of titanium. And I love it. Oh. Would you be cryogenically frozen if you could do it? I would, but I'd leave myself out on a towel. Right. Never. Because if you do it too quickly, there is shrinkage. You gotta be careful. Did you read in the paper this is true. Apparently, the world's oldest man, who's 113, lives in some little part of Japan, like little island in Japan. But apparently the world's oldest woman also lives in exactly the same place. Now, I don't know if she's since died, but she lived in the same place. As what? Do you not think there's something suspicious going on there? I mean, isn't that a bit eerie? I'm thinking, have you ever seen them together? And has he ever found lipstick in his bag? I think that would be one of the same. I wonder if it's something like, you know, what brought Godzilla back. There's some kind of semantics over there. No, there might be. Sort of like. Yeah. Although just hearing some of Carl's stories about school, there's somewhat going on there where he lives. Yeah. Did you say you did live near a sort of nuclear plant or something? I found out it wasn't a nuclear plant, it was a chemical plant. My God. Really? And is that really true? What color was the tap water in your area? It was better than it is in London. Really? Talking to someone about this the other day. Yeah. Water in London's ropey. And I use one of them water filters. Do you really? And the guy down in the office was saying it's a waste of time, though, because they only work for a couple of waters. Like, you fill your jug twice and then the water's going through the same muck. That's true enough, but it's not. If it's not getting through, it's not getting through. No. If it's a filter, it doesn't matter, does it? Still not good, though. Fair enough. So just. Are you just throwing it away? Based on what? That. Currently show you another one that. He had on him, a better updated model? Yeah. Did he ever see, when you say. Like, he works here, was he actually hanging around outside? Yeah. With a glass of easy. Yeah, yeah. Just go back to insults briefly. Go on. Because that's. That's what he said. It's in the head. What do you mean? He said no. Did he say that? No, I mean, when did you call me goofy? No, he didn't. He said about. Even goofy goggle eyes. Fair enough. I'm not even goofy. That's not fair. You've got the proper features. What? Just needs sorting out a bit. I can't help it if me hair is not good. I noticed the other day when Carl was sitting on your knee having his picture taken. It's a long story. Right. He's got a completely spherical head. It's slightly too small. I'm not being funny because, I mean, you know, I'm not perfect, but he's got a completely spherical little head. He looks a little bit like a baby hamburger, you know, hamburger off McDonald's. He looks like a little baby hamburglar. And it's sort of quite put upon. It's. Suzanne thinks I look like that thing in that Dulux advert. You know, when the woman pulls the. Head off that, a little plasticine, and. Then they make a new ad for it and it's like a little head. Really? That's your girlfriend saying it. I know. Anyway, listen, let's. Let's get back to business here. This is a great track. It's America by Simon Agarth. Uncle. This is where I started saying, we don't care about being trendy and all that. That was it. Strokes last night, XFN 104.9. We're flying now 35 minutes into it. No real. No real hiccups. I don't think that so far. And that's going well. My name's Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve. Hello there, Carl. All right, coming up soon. White van, man. White van. Carl. We asked Carl the questions that the sun asked someone else. It's a good feature. Great feature. I'll be testing car. And they knew the new re education of car, as you know. You got a GCSE in history. It was the last heavy sort of one. Yeah. So Winston Churchill. We got. You got. We're going on to more sort of metaphorical and metaphysical sort of pursuits, aren't we? Not that book. Yeah, that's the. Can you do that in a week? You don't have to read it. Just choose out. Just choose the ones about the foxes eating penguins. You'll like that, Steve, over to you. Thanks very much. I wonder if. I don't think we've made much progress yet on sending Carl into sort of into the air with the. No, this has gone a bit ballistic, actually. Oh, no, shut up. Don't. You haven't got. We've inflamed the imagination of the capital. There's people offering left, right and center and I think it's a good idea, but I think we should. We should, you know, make a day of it. I think we should send you up in some balloons. Right. Maybe, you know. Well, hang on, before we carry on, let's explain what happened because people might not have listened last week. I don't believe that there are one or two, Rick. I don't believe that people who were. Maybe out of the country. Okay. Yeah. So last week we discovered. Was it that 623? Is it 600? No, I read that 6000 balloons filled with helium can lift a bloke off the floor. I think that's too many. I think that's too many. I think we could do it for less, certainly. Well, anyway, listen, there are various organizations which actually exist already that can provide this kind of entertainment, this kind of fun. I mean, I didn't realize there was a whole kind of market for this. Already, but apparently no. Incredible. Anyway, so we're going to try and track one of them down. We're going to see if they can. They can organize it so that you, Carl, can float into the air. We need to get you what is at least 11ft up. Yeah, and I think certainly higher. I can't remember what the record is, but it's quite a long way. 11,000 11,000ft. Yeah. But I think they're all official. We. I want to do it with, like, little. Those little balloons you get for a quid at the zoo. I don't think that can be right. Health and safety wise. I don't think that can be healthy. I think as we get him to sign some up, which I will. Okay. I think we'll cover ourselves. But, yes, certainly we're thinking of maybe making it a bit like. Is it tea in the park? Yeah. Capital FM. Yeah. The big event. Get sort of steps. At least H from steps can come down and host the event. I mean, I don't mind comparing it. Steve's gonna do. Steve's learning to sort of like, scratch and mix and beat match and. I mean, you're getting pretty. I'm making a lot of progress. Yeah. You are going to be a turntable lister. Yeah. Steve never learned an instrument which he regrets, you know, and, you know, he's a modern lad and he's using turntables as his instrument. I just got two turntables on the microphone and so far, I mean, that's. Seriously, I'm cutting out big style. No, don't. Don't laugh, because it is mental. That's the kind of stuff I'm coming out with. And I'm scratching. I've got the beats, you know, matching. Can you imagine that? Shut up. It's out there. No, no, if. Look at the chemical brothers, for goodness sake, you're talking about freaks. Man alive. At least you cut your hair at Gavin, you know that whatever it's called. They used to kind of at least faintly appear in their videos. And if someone is just some shots of, like, what you see from outside a train, to them, that is more glamorous and exciting, apparently, than seeing the lads themselves in the video. Who do you think is cooler to look at? Steve or the chemical brothers? Steve, definitely. Yes, you're absolutely right, Carl. And that's the first sensible thing you've said for a long time, to work. With Steve on some music. Yeah. If he had the choice, I think Steve would look better on a album cover. Really? Yeah. What would you do? Would you change him at all to. What would you do with his image? I put him in the distance. I can't believe this is just so. You don't look as tall. That's doing you a favor. No, I was on the. This is true. I was on the. On the tube, right. Coming in to meet Gervaise the other day, and I was wearing a suit and my mobile phone slipped out my pocket and it landed on the seat. And I didn't realize this. And as I was about to get off, some bloke who was sat like an old guy, he picked up the phone, he went, oi, lanky, you dropped your mobile phone. And I was like, well, I thank you for pointing out I dropped my phone, but did you have to do the lanky? But you knew he meant. I bet you turned round straight away. It worked. Knew he meant he's done you again. But I was the only person stood up. It was a fairly empty train. Was there any other lanky people there? No, no, but my point was, there was no one else at all who was about to exit the train. Okay, so he didn't need lanky. He could have gone, excuse me, sir, or oi, you, anything but oi, lanky. Know. It's that thing, though, in it. That's what I'm talking about. You say the thing that you don't want to say. It's like me with Ken Dodd and Will. I think he wanted to say this. I think he took pleasure in it. I think he went, that blokes lanky. I shouldn't say that. Yeah, I should. I lanky. What's he gonna do? Yeah. Do you want your phone back or not? Well, this balloon thing, anyway, it's got a bit out of hand. Why is it out of hand? What? It's funny, I just want to. I want, you know, I want to sort of like, tie them all to the back of your belt so as you go up there, you sort of tip forward slightly. So you're going up slightly upside down. We could paint some advertising on your bald head. Yeah. Oh, that'd be great. Yeah, we'll do that, Lanky. That'd be great. I mean, last week it was just a bit of fun about going, like just lifting my feet off the ground. No. And that's a big difference to what it's got now. No, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what. We'll do. A hundred feet in the air and we're. And I'll hold onto the rope, but. We'Ll do it at Wembley arena. We'll sell tickets. But it'll be for charity, Carl. It'll be for charity. We'll have lots of underprivileged kids coming along to see it. You know, it's like, um, you know, I like karaoke, but I won't want to go on stars on the rise. Sure. And it's got out of hand. That's how it's sort of. It's grown too big. I don't. Who would you do if you were on stars on the rise? I do that. Moby now, that Jack the knife song. Jack the knife. Old Matt Keith. That one, yeah. Is Mac the knife. That's what I do. But which he do a hip hop version. But which of the many singers would you impersonate? You can't. It's not the song, is it? It's the singer. You could do Jimmy Somerville, I think, quite well. Yeah, Somerville you. Moby. Did Morph bring out a single? I don't think Morph did, didn't he? No, I'm not sure. Didn't have a theme tune. Did Morph phone in? If you think morph. Morph didn't speak. Rick let me sing Morph hardly had any features. True. Express two featuring David Byrne Lazy XFM 104.94 to two. I'm Ricky Gervais. Steve's got the sun. Yes, we're just going to be doing white van, Carl, where we ask Carl the questions the sun asked some other bloke. That's right, because we think Carl's got more to say than anyone on anything. Carl only tells the truth, by the way. Just remember that, listeners, off you go. Yes, well, today's white van man in the sun is John Slade. He owns his own door maintenance company. His answers are very informative, I have to say. But, Carl, what do you make of the Channel four producer, aged 330, who duped a school into believing he was a teenager for a documentary? Are you familiar with this story? No. Go on. Well, basically, a 30 year old guy kind of fool the school into thinking he was a pupil for a secret documentary. The school's outraged. Do you think that that's for you? Should anything go when it comes to making tv? I think I've said to you before, there's loads of kids at my school, I remember being in the first year. And kids, what year do schools go up to? I was in the first year. What is it? Eleven five. Oh, sorry. First year of infants and juniors? No, secondary school. Eleven. Right. Year eleven kids. No, not year eleven. They're eleven when they first go to secondary school. Right, well, I'm eleven, the kids are the older. Well, this is when you can leave when you're 16, I think. Aren't you now? Right, well, kids who were 16. Yeah. Looked old. They had. They did have beards. I remember going there and thinking some of them were teachers. I think he's answered that next one. What's the next one. Tattoos and everything. Kids in the. In the earlier years even. What do you make of the fact that Mariah Carey's 38 million pound payoff has cost EMI staff their jobs and we're talking 1800 EMI staff who have lost their jobs? Yeah. I mean. I mean, is that silly money? Mariah Carey on 38 million? She doesn't need that much. She has to dress nice, though. It's not her fault. I'd say. It's bad business. Emi, did you say? Yes. Right. They've got rid of them. Staff are his left. He was gonna do the work. They should have. They should have got a loan and paid her. Okay. I mean, vicious circle, that, right? Have you, have you done. You don't have a business degree, you. Commerce. Where do you do that? What? Did you do that? Fill out a check, pay a bill? I think I had a trip around Kellogg's. Did you, did you get. Did you get an o level? We know you didn't know, but was. There a commerce exam or was it just a division of math? What? Did he fill out? A check. Subset of math. It was an option. It was like, if you want to. Do it, what was it? Pay a bill, pay a bill, have. A visit right down Kellogg's. And I saw my sister's boyfriend there at the time. He sorted me out with some variety packs. Really? What was in them? You know, Rice Krispies and cocoa dust or whatever is space. Sorry. That wasn't Ken Dodd, though. That was someone else's. That was an answer, yeah. That wasn't special k. Oh, this then. Home Secretary David Blunkett admits that muggers rule some streets. Weird this, because when I was out. With you, I don't believe it's gonna be weird. Whatever you say. When we were in that pub that night and we got talking about muggers and that, the tip is what I tend to do because I nearly got mugged once. Act what? You nearly got mugged once? I nearly got mugged, yeah. But I tried this technique of acting a bit mental. Right, and how did you act mental? Well, this guy wanted me trainers and I was in Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester. It was quite late one night and he come up, he said, I want them trainers. I said, you want them? I said, I worked hard for these. Said, how dare you come to me asking? And I got a bit livid and I looked at me like, oh, my God, he's got a right one here. And he left me. Were you acting mental or were you just mental? No, I put it on a bit. Well, you're not tetra petrified though. Well, you don't think about it, do you, when you sort of. In the eyes of danger. Well, not you, clearly. You're a brave man. So what did you say? I just. I just went. I just went a bit mad. I just kind of. Because he said he wanted the trainers and that they were dear ones at the time and I just know you're not having these sort of crafted you. I said I wanted these trainers. Yeah. And, you know, went on to tell him how I work out printers and I don't enjoy it and, you know, I put in all these hours and that and I have to cycle home for about 5 miles and. Did he give you his trainers? Yeah. Did you have a knife? I just left. No, I didn't get that. Didn't get that violent. Well, that's very brave you, Carl. Yeah. It's good advice though. Just that mental. See what should. He tried it the other night. Oh, Liza Minnelli. Yeah. She says, I've worked hard for these diamonds. Yeah. It's not easy being the daughter of Judy Garland. You don't know what it's like. Finally, apparently there was a crook that got a job, a security job at Heathrow. Right. He was a crook and he got job at Heathrow as robbers steal another 2 million pounds. Apparently security down there is lax. Yeah. Is that concern for you? Is this another. Yeah, 2 million? Yeah. Why is all this money at the airport? Um, it's those sandwich shops. You know, they're really expensive. The sandwiches in like, when you're playing, they're like 50 for tuna, which is ludicrous. Yeah, that's basically. What do you mean? Why is all this money? Airports. What is it doing there? Why have a go. No other go. Answering this yourself. Why is anything at an airport? It's going somewhere or coming in from somewhere. Yeah. But money you can sort out through the bank, like phone banks and that. Have you done commerce? You know a lot about paying bills and writing out checks. Yeah. Tell us about Kellogg's. What was it like? What was in the factory? Was it just like squashing bits of corn? Pretty boring really. Just loads of conveyor belts. Yeah. Boxes of cornflakes everywhere. Just what you imagine. Yeah. So was it more. This is where you might be working. This is where you're likely to work. Possibly. There was two trips. There was that. And the trips of Manchester even use. Okay. And I left that early because they had a job in Cordon, Kellogg's. Like a supermarket. Yeah. And I had to leave the trip early and the teacher went mad, saying they thought I'd got lost on the, you know, in the building and stuff. No, because it was like day two of working in this supermarket and I couldn't be late. I thought, by the time I explain where I've got to go and everything, I'll be even later. Sure. So I just left and then apparently they were searching the building and everything for me. Oh, stuck in a printer. What was the printer's name? You worked at a superdon blur? That's great, isn't it? It's rubbish. Oh, got sucked. What did you get sacked for? Messing about in a back. In the car park. Around the back there was a grid and all the concrete had gone. Funny. So when it rained, you got like a big lake. Oh, yeah. And I got in. Do you know those big metal trolleys you get to, like, put all the food in? Oh, yeah. And I got in one of them and pushed myself out into this lake of cement. No. And I got stuck in the middle, right. And the boss was like, where's. Where's Carl? He's meant to be doing, you know, facing up the beans. So someone said, oh, I saw him messing about out the back. He came out and saw me stuck in the middle of this. Would you say, no, I'm filming sharks? I said, it's too deep, I can't get out. You'll have to pass me something. And he said, I'm not passing you nothing. He said, you can get out of there and walk through it. I said, I'm not. I've got my trainers on. Probably the same one. Yeah. You've risked your life with him. Yeah. I said, I'm not getting these wet. I said, what are you going to do? I said, I'm going to wait for the water to go down the grid. He said, the grid's blocked. Now get out. Are you sacked? I said, well, I'm not getting out. He said, right, you sacked. So. So you were sacked. How long did you have to wait for the water to go down the grid? At the end, I did get bored and I sort of did a bit of a leap and a jump and got 1ft wet. How long were you waiting? About half an hour. Just think of it. Just think. I mean, how did he get himself into that situation? That's fantastic. Should we play a record? Oh, definitely, definitely. That's a joy. Oh, you're an absolute pleasure. More white van man. Next time on the show, electric soft parade. I keep trying to get the album for free from you, Carl, you've not sorted me out yet. I have to rely on other people to give me different comments. Please do. This is one called. There's a silence. Gomez and shot. Shot on XFN 101.9. Sorry, I was going to tell Steve something. Talk amongst yourselves. When you were out there, Johnny Mango phoned up and said to Carl, come on, when are we going to do this thing? And Carl got all nervous. He went, you don't want to do it, do. He went, he said, well, it's going to get out of hand. I just wanted to go as high as a tree. And he went, well, you. Can we just hold you down with a rope? He went, yeah, but he said, but when the crowd are there and they're all screaming, higher, higher. I'll feel the pressure and have to go along with it. What crowd? Hi. No, hi. Don't live in, like, a medieval era. It's not gonna be dancing bears and tumbling midgets. Hold on. If there's anyone got any of those. Some midgets would be amazing. Yeah, definitely. Less balloons, cheaper to do. Oh, you're going. No, you're going up with them. No, you're going up with. Not just with a midget under either arm. Brilliant. Yeah. Oh, dear. Oh, it's time for your. The re education of Carl Pilkington. This week, Carl was studying the life and times of Winston Churchill. What did you make of it, Kyle? What did Churchill do for you? Well, last week I made a bit of an error with Hitler to remember too much and it just. It was way too much for me. So what I've done this week, sort of flicked through, got a few of them basic facts. Yeah. And what I've learned. Right. Bit weird the way all these people have something in common, that they're all a bit weird when. When the younger. Okay, they've gone. Was gone. Well, you know, Rasputin, he wasn't well as a kid. Yeah. Guevara was. This is Rasputin. The mad monk wasn't well. Yeah, yeah. Che Guevara. Asthma. Asthma. Really bad asthma. Hitler, he was only one boy. Mental. His mother. That could be labeled. Yeah. And if we don't. And Churchill. Yeah. Very weak. Very weak child. Was he? He only spoke to his dad four times in his old lifetime. Really? Yeah. Didn't get on with his dad. I think one of the times when his dad spoke to him, he was having a go, saying he didn't do as well in the army as he wanted him to. Right. So that's pretty sad. Yeah. So that spurred him on anyway. Yeah. I'm not going in all the ins and outs. Very, uh, very important bloke. Okay. No, seriously. I mean, your dad bought the tapes to me. Yes. And I can understand why. Because he did. It did change a lot for us, you know. I mean, we won't be sat here now talking like this. Why? We could have been German. Yeah. He didn't let that happen. No. Everyone had a go at him. Right. When it, when it went like, I think was Chamberlain, he was in power and he was like saying, don't be trusting that Hitler. Yeah. You know, and everyone was like, look, stop causing trouble. Chamberlain sorted it out. You know, he sorted out a peace agreement. Yeah. And he was like, no, don't trust him. And everyone's like, oh, you know, you're just causing trouble. You know, everyone else is happy. Then it turned out that Hitler did actually do the dirty. Yeah. And try and come over. I remember he. Did he do something? Started a war. So it was a conflict of some kind. Yeah, yeah. Started a problem and everyone went, hang on a minute. Churchill knew what he was talking about. Yeah, yeah. Get him back in charge. And they got him in and Hitler was scared of him because he knew that he wasn't going to be having any lies or anything. He couldn't try it on with Churchill. Yeah. Especially when he was a little bit pissed up and coked and with a big cigar. Churchill, he wasn't that. He wasn't doing that. I think. I think a lot wear the. During the war in the war cabinet. I think that have things to keep him awake all night and stuff and certainly like to Brandy. Rick, Winston Churchill was coked up. Was he? I mean, sorry, this is something I wasn't aware of. If there are any historians listening, if I'm wrong, I'm world at war. No, any, any historians or, you know, experts on, on war. Did, did Churchill and not, not some of the, the other people during, I think the first and second world War take a little bit of. So when he said that doctors certainly used to. Hitler like cakes, would they be like the funny sort of cakes? No, they probably did like a little bit of Madeira cake. Yeah. There's probably nothing. Sorry, carry on. So anyway, beat the Bosch. Yeah. Steady on. His personal life, nothing to do with it. And the most amazing bit is, right, he wasn't, he wasn't fit and he had a couple of. He's a good looking bloke in many ways. He had a couple of strokes, but he had a stroke on site. We've had that. He beat the Bosch. He likes to have a couple of strokes. Let's not get into innuendo, Kyle. It's stupid. Right. Say he had, like, a stroke on a Tuesday. He was. He was up on fighting again on the Wednesday. Really? He was a strong bloke. Yeah. And then he died at about the age of 86 something. He's good lad, wasn't he? He was really good, yeah. So is he the easy, the one you. You favor most of all, say, out. Of all, I mean, Rasputin, I don't understand why you got. Like I said, I don't know why they made a book on him. No, no. He just didn't deserve it. No, no. Che Guevara. You know, he had his. He had his time, suppose, and did a bit. Did a bit good for certain people. Sort of Cuba out. Doesn't really affect me. No Hitler. I mean. Enough said. Yeah. Bad luck. Churchill sorted it all out. Yeah. So your favorite, out of the four of them, the last four is Churchill. Yeah. Brilliant. Brilliant. I agree. I agree with you. I think what I love with your kind of, sort of summary of these people's incredible lives is the way that it's almost like. I remember in looking magazine, I don't remember looking. It was the junior TV Times. They used to have half a page, which was a comic strip. Yeah. Summarizing someone's life, you might have, say, five star. The story of five star. Yeah. And you'd have a picture. I always remember the Roger Moore one was a picture of, like, Roger's parents. Like, Roger Moore was born in 1930. Picture of Roger's parents. Roger grew up during the war. Picture of Roger running down the street, right? This is a school kid with a Spitfire coming behind him, like he was gonna try and shoot him. Mister Smith, surely. Exactly. Exactly. Roger took up acting. Picture of Roger, like, acting. Yeah. Roger became James Bond. James Bond Rogers. Now a popular, you know, star in his own right. And there's a lot work for charity. Brilliant. Summed up the whole thing and kind of. I think they used to have that in one of the tv times, or. I remember. So when it was Tina Turner, what's a born Sarah may bullock. Then it was nutbush city limit. Stop hitting me, Ike. And then simply the best. And that was it. How your summary of great, great events. Is, I'd say, if you didn't know about Churchill, you've learned a bit today. Can people call in that? All these. All these fellows taking cocaine? I think I'm right. It's o 8700. 800 1234. Yeah, give us a call. XFM 104.9. Did Winston Churchill and various other dignitaries take coke during the war? During the war, saying up for the war effort that emergency summits and meetings. I think it was. I think it's been documented. I could be wrong. And let me tell you now, it's not happening today. Wow. Pete, you're on there. He's there, isn't he? To save me for Nancy. XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky. Ladies, with me, Steve Merchant, Carpool. I'm getting excited now because we've had loads of calls and emails not only backing me up, but going a little bit further. Apparently, Johnny Mango called in again. He's become our sort of official researcher on this show that there is evidence that Queen Victoria in Balmorra with a young houseguest, Winston Churchill, used to consume cocaine filled lozenges. So there you go. Also, MDMA was a precursor sort of ecstasy, a derivative, and that was big in the day, giving soldiers, you know, a little pick me up. So it's not so mad, is it? It's always, he was into his speeches and that. And they say that coke gives you sort of, you know, the balls to stand up and say, like, not that. That'S a good thing. No, it's not. No, definitely not. No. Right. But it. Apparently it gives you. It gives you. It makes you confident on it. So you can stand up and say, you know, we're gonna fight them on the beaches. Yeah. And all that. And you mean it. Exactly, yeah. When he was sort of like, you know, a little bit pissed up with his cigar on, coked off his tits. He wanted a fight. He didn't care where it was. He'd fart on a beach. He didn't care. He didn't care if he got sand in his new trainers. He was boozed up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You want to fight. Yeah. That's why he was coming hard. He was very much. You gotta think of him as the Liam Gallagher of his day. Yeah. Oh, dear. To talk about this. I mean. I don't mean in terms of referencing drugs, but we lose. Is this, like, libelous to Winston Churchill? One, libel, the dead. Is that. Only in America? I'm asking. And we're not. We're not saying, you know. Two, I think you'd probably do a fair comment. Three we say we were joking. Four it's a satire. Yeah. Five we love him. Five we're not. We're not condoning drugs in any way. Six, this is during my O'Leary show. I didn't have a go at him anyway. I said, he's all right. If there's any law against Rasputin, we might be in trouble. You did willfully Rasputin off Russia's greatest love machine. Yeah, yeah. You didn't shoot him till he was dead, did you? Oh, put some poison into him. I'll tell you this, if there's any other historical questions that people want answered, then we're the men. Because really, with the three of us, our knowledge of the fact that the Hindenburg was filled with helium. Yeah. The kind of coke habits and various drug habits of Britain's most famous political leader. Yeah, we've got the answers to all of it, Einstein. Go on. I found out in the week that he didn't talk till he was six. See, it's all. It's all these people who are. Churchill couldn't read, could he, till he was eight or nine. Really? Yeah. There you go. He had. He got a d in history, apparently. GCSE. Just one better. No, but Carl called me the week and he was a little bit stressed because he's had a couple of. He's had a bad week now. He got stressed about Hitler and Churchill. And I said, well, we chilled out a little bit and our teaching somewhat, a little bit cozier. And I said, what about animals? No, you know, not frightening other animals. You're interested in animals, aren't you? You know, and he went, all right then. All right then. And then he went, okay, here's a question for you, Pebba. So there's three animals without ears. He said, and I've told you one. And I went, well, that's the snake. Because he was talking about the snake. I went, hold on, Carl, there's loads of animals without ears. He went, there's not. There's three. I went, there's loads. I said, jellyfish, worms, single cell protozoa, peripheral spot. He went, oh, what are you talking about? What are you talking about? Animals. Proper animals? I went, they are animals. Went, no, proper animals. And I went, do you mean mammals? He went, what are you on about? I said, are these animals? Have they got legs and are they fur bearing? Right. And he went, one is, they've got legs. I went, I don't know. I give up. He went, right, the turtle. I went, right, yeah. And he went, and the bumblebee, he said, that's the one with fur. That's the one with fur. The one. What are you thinking? What is in your head, Karl, which. Has got the most fur? A bee or a turtle. It's not fur. What is it? Well, it's. It's, you know, he's done you. There's pseudo hairs, isn't it? It's like it's a hair. It's a keratin thing. It's not like we have mammals grow fur. Know what I mean? Yeah. He's not convinced. We say like, mammals are warm blooded creatures, often, usually placental, has a few exceptions, right? That give their milk to their young, nurture their young and they have fur. Have you heard about osters? Osters? Oysters. They. 1 minute they're a man, then they're a woman, then they're a man again. Like Eddie is odd. Now that's fibulous. He's a transvestite. Could I say he's not a transsexual? Let's say that straight away. I'm retracting that. Go on then. Give us more facts. No, I've got you sops, fables. Nobody had some more facts. You told me that were dead good. I just wondered if Steve knew him. What? What do you want to know? The ones that you read out to me. You had. You had one about a. The spiky thing gone. Porcupine. Give me a clue. How many spikes the porcupine got? Dunno. How many was it? I think it was about 10,000. But these aren't. These aren't the most interesting facts, are they? It's all right. It's all right though, isn't it? Yeah. And he went, but how can they say that? You could say that, you know, we've got a certain amount of hairs in our head. I went, ten hundred thousand average. He went, yeah. But I haven't. So how do we know that that porcupine that they've counted is the same for all of them? Might have had alopecia. Yeah. Yeah, he might be. Particularly. Hair one. I mean. Right, you got a. Do you know. Do you know what a fable is? I tried to explain briefly. Do you know what fable is? Okay. It's a thing that uses sort of metaphor, analogy, just to explain sort of morals. I mean, they're, they're very. They're very, very old, for a start. And it's all. I'll give you an example of one, a quick one. Oh, the one about the. The dog with two bones. He goes to a dog's got a bone. He sees reflection in the lake and he thinks, oh, that dog's got a nice bone. I'll have that. And as he goes to get that one, in reflection, he drops the one he's got. And that's one about, you know, I. Think I was told one when I was younger. Go on. I think it was one. This young lad, he's got a dog, right? And he sort of is about eight years old, and this dog, he's had it since he was about four, and it's a bit tired now, and he chuck sticks for it and it doesn't go for it. And he's saying to his mama, I want a new dog because this one's useless. It doesn't do what, you know, it doesn't have any fun with me. So they say, oh, no. But, you know, Rover's a good little dog. Should look after it. He's like, oh, I don't like it. I want a new one. So they buy him a new puppy and it's running around yapping about and he's loving it and he's playing around with it in the grass. And then one day he goes to the park and he's messing about and rolling about with it, and he falls into the lake, right? And the little pup is like yapping at him and he's going, help me. Help me. Little dog's yapping. And then the old dog comes and gets his collar and it pulls him out of the lake and he goes, oh, God, you know, why did I forget about you? You're the better dog. And he loved that one again, rather than the puppy. I got a feeling that was Lassie. Yeah, that was an episode of Lassie. What's the moral? What's the moral there, Kyle? What's that telling? What? What's. That's explaining through analogy. So don't forget the old. Look after old people. I remember there was one I heard once about a young boy who got trapped in a lake inside a cage. But he loved trainers so much, he. Wasn'T gonna get them wet. And even though he had to go. There and even though he thought that was the important thing, because it's material value, he actually drowned. And the trainers were no good to him then. Hate to say I told you so. Now I'll clear a couple of things up. Obviously, me and Steve, we love Carl. This is not. This is. The things we give Carl to read and talk is not to embarrass him or stress him out at all. We genuinely like his view of the world. In fact, we did an interview yesterday with a bloke from this standard. He really liked the show and said, did you like Karl? She take the piss out of him a lot. And you know, we just like to say we love Carl. I said to that, I said, it's like I've got a new kitten. I can't wait to get in and see his little face on Saturdays, didn't I? Yes. And I think I'm worried because I thought I'd give Carl something he was really get his teeth into with easy fables. It involves animals and, you know, little stories. But I've given him a couple and he doesn't seem to be that impressed or understand the concept. You said you'd bring in an animal fucking book as well. I can't see that anywhere. No, we can only read one book at a time. Can't. Why didn't you bring the other one in first? Well, it's big. I work my way up to it sometime. I probably have to get a cab because. A bit big. Now listen, I'll give it to give this one. This is an easy one. Now just think, right? Think just what it means. They're not that, they're not that hidden, they're not that cryptic. Just think what this means. Okay? Okay. When the hares addressed a public meeting and claimed that all should have fair shares, the lions answered a good speech. Hairy feet, but it lacks claws and teeth such as we have. How would you use that? No, what do you think that means? This is, this is translated from the. I don't know, Greek or something. I don't know. It was, it was Aesop. Where's he from? Greek. Yeah. So it, you know, it. Should I do it in my own language? Okay, um. So what would happen if there's hares and they have a meeting in the jungle with like loads of lions and go, hey, hold on 1 minute. I think we should all be equal and share everything. Alright. And the lions go, well, yeah, it's easy for you to say. We've got claws and teeth. Yeah. What does that mean? It's saying like corsair. Hares want that because it's better for them. The lions get nothing out of it because they're already king of the jungle. That's right. So it's negotiating from weakness. Anyone can negotiate from strength, but negotiate from weakness is your. It's, it's, you know, it's, it's be lovely. It's a lovely utopian. Look at the animal. The way you said it is better than the way they worded it. Well, that's because, that's because Ricky's very much the modern decent. I mean, many people have thought that, you know, that's why he's getting a lot of awards with the tv show. Yeah. Take that home and read ones you like and tell me about the ones you like. Ones that click. I don't care if you only come in with, like, one or two. Go, I'll tell you what, Rick, that's a mate. That. There's one thing that I've learned from that, you know, because sometimes you can, all these phrases, and until some happens, you don't, you don't think, you know, everyone's heard, you know, to, I don't know, to err is human, to forgive, divine, but. And then some, you know, might happen. Do you go, oh, that's what that means. That's amazing. So, you know, do you know any steve I found? What's that, a fable? Well, I would imagine that the most famous one I've always remembered is the, you know, the lion with the, the thing in its hoof. Lion, yeah, with the spike in its paw. And a smaller animal gets out for it, but it still attacks it anyway. Well, that's life in it. Well, I read one the other day, actually, which is very interesting. It was one that the famous film director, Orson Wells, said, oh, yeah. But she said, apparently there was a bear going across a lake, wading through the lake, and a scorpion said, well, let me go on your back, will you? Come on, just let me go on your back. We'll go across. It'd be brilliant. He goes, well, no, you're just sting me. Don't be stupid. If I sting you, you'll die and we'll both drown. And he goes, oh, fair enough. Who was doing this thing in the. Scorpion and the bear is wading through the water. So the scorpion jumps on the back and they wade through the water, and halfway across, the scorpion stings the bear. And the bear goes, we're both gonna die now. He goes, yeah, it's my nature. I thought he was gonna say, I can swim. Oh, you're the best. What's the one about, dude? Does that mean anything to you? It's my nature. I, you know, that's in my nature. That's. That's what I do. Yeah, I'm a scorpion. Yeah, one of my favorite ones. These don't mean anything to you, do they? I mean, one thing is, you're not impressed by them. They're. All right, what about this? What was he saying? Well, why not just say, don't trust bears. The bears, the one that was too trustworthy. Don't trust scorpions. Right. It's one of my favorite ones of all time. Okay. A lion is dying is an old lion. He's in the front of his cave, and all the animals come around, like the foxes and the hyenas and the rabbits, and they're all taking the piss out of him and they're laughing at him and they're laughing, you can't fight us now. And just before he dies, he goes, fine, but I was a lion once. What does that mean? Don't know what he's saying. It's better to have lived and had what I had, because I was. I was great, if only for a short time. And you lot are still alive, but you're nothing. You're rabbits and hairs. I was a lion once. So, you know. Are they always using animals for these stories? Well, yeah, I could. I could change it to fridge refrigerators and household appliances if it make it help. But animals, you know, I remember the. One about being ill a lot, and you say something about gone. You know, if you keep doing that, if you keep having time off, I won't believe you. That's the boycott wolf. Yeah. Yeah. This is probably the most powerful one. When you're pulling a face and they say, what if the wind changes? Scientifically proven, that is. That can happen. That can happen. Should we have hip hop hooray. Cute up for that? No, but go on. You carl? Sort of. Me? I was gonna. No, come on. This is what I asked you to play me. If you've not, you know, you ain't too big for your boots now with the show, this lifestyle, you're not paying attention, are you? Not playing what you play? Heat magazine's favorite. Yeah. Okay, so, um, you know, with the big. I can't believe, you know, fables are great. He's not impressed, is he, really? I mean, you know, once I get this book home tonight and that. Yeah, have a read. I might. I might change my mind on them next week. You're coming all stressed. I'm not impressed with the ones you've. You've been talking about, I must admit. Okay, okay. Okay. This album is by this group nerd, who are big hip hop and r and b users in the states. Yeah, we played a track from them in the past. Bobby James. This album's been re recorded. I don't know why exactly. With live instruments, you don't get many r and b and hip hop records now with live instruments, so it's pretty. So computers in it, Steve these days and drum machines. And there is a forthcoming single. I suspect you might be this track rock. I'm not gonna play that. I'm gonna play track two. Things are gonna get better. New order, here to stay. Sadly, we're not here to stay, Steve. We only got about two more minutes. That's true enough. Yeah. Well, I think that's just time for some interesting facts that Johnny Mango, our researcher from lose Control.com, has emailed us a few familiar ones. Favorite ones of yours, I think. Any ones? I don't know, though. I think, you know this one don't. Your pig's orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. I know. And a pig can't actually look directly up. 30 minutes of coming. Absolutely. Be careful. That's incredible. Remember, amateur to Tom bins gone. Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure. Bonobos do as well. They've rediscovered. Which is it. Which is a. Yeah. Chimpanzee. Like a chimpanzee. Right. Yeah. So it's three now. Can't believe. Dolphins again. They're all at it now. Yeah. Polar bears are left handed. Yeah. I don't quite know how they work that. They give him spelling tests, lighting tests. Oh, yeah. They probably just do it. It's probably the paw they use to hide up the black nose during a hunt. Of course, yes. Some lions mate over 50 times a day. Yeah. Not every day of the year. Okay. They don't do that every day. No. Okay. Because again, I'm worried. No. You know, I didn't think that dolphin. What day of the year do you do it? 50 times? It's coming up to it. It's April, isn't it? You'd like to get out there? Special day. Yeah, yeah. Maybe we could. We could coincide that with the balloon event. It'll just me, be me, quietly humping in the corner. Volunteers, welcome to email. Now, you know all the proceeds go. To charity if you are a desperate lioness. Exactly. Yeah. Butterflies taste with their feet. I didn't know that. Interesting. I didn't know that. That is interesting. But they don't eat much, do they? Because they only live a day. Good boy. They won't need to eat. An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain. Yeah, I knew that. Yeah. That's extraordinary, that is. Yeah. And the car. How big are your eyes? Finally. I think we've discussed this before. We. A cockroach will live nine days without its head. Yeah. Or it starves to death. Yeah. It's only because it can't get water and food. Yeah. It would be quite happy going around doing his normal things. Yeah. I mean, probably to work if you're just as good without your head, is with your head. May as well not have a head. I just. I don't see the point. Well, that was thanks to Johnny Mangler there of what's his website, who's turned into a sort of volunteer researcher. Yeah, he's very fast. Lose control.com. Can I just say as well, we've had lots of emails from different people just saying they enjoy the show and offering little tidbits and things. Nick wilson, Sarah and Lauren. Ken, dan, Jane. She wants a mash. We didn't play ash, never mind. Lee, jazz Derry. There's those people there. Well, again, we're talking earlier about, you know, you're not caring about being like a geek or a freak or not trendy. No, I'm just saying I am trendy and I know. Yeah. And I'm going to play a bit of an easy listening. I apologize to those people who still tune in. Expect to hit 2 hours of new metal or gorillas. And this is a very old fashioned lovely tune. It's bread. I hope you enjoy it. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage bread. Bread.",
