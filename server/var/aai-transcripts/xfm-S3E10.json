  "text": "Kings of Leon, California, waiting. Steve, the public have been waiting for us to return. That's true enough. All right. Yeah, they had the best of last week. They had Canfield and us without car the week before. But it's been a while since we've all been together. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me is Steve Merchant. And over there with his little sunburnty baldy head, little car pilking. All right. Yeah. That wasn't Steve slapping me out then, by the way. No, that was just him clapping at like, Steve Wright in the afternoon, because he so is a good show. Yeah. He's so pleased that we're a posse and we're all back together. Three holidays Carl's had this year, last year. Yeah, I'd love to have three holidays. You've got to start putting the work in over two holidays they had three holidays. You went away with Suzanne and her parents. Yeah, well, that doesn't count. It does count if you book. If you book two weeks off the firm, you go away and you go how much holiday where? I didn't really count. It wasn't a really good ol. You can have them days back, please. Yeah. My new year's resolution is to be nicer to you. But. No, but. Talk sense. Talk sense. You've had three odds this year. And I'm just saying you're in your thirties now, and thirties is when you should be really putting the work in. That's true enough to reap the benefits in your forties. Fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties, nineties and 100. Carl, what's your new year resolution? What about think before you speak? See, I'm allowed to laugh. I'm allowed to laugh at things other people say. Carl, that was. That is a good suggestion. How was your holiday, Carl? Uh, it was all right. Right. Brilliant. But that I don't see on the kind of. On these, on the ratio of. Of good to bad. In Carl's mind, that might be amazing because we never. I'll tell you what, can we have, you know, a cracking little tune and then come back and hear about Carl's Holloway? Let's keep it tight. Let me tear us apart by joy division. Now, I can't put my finger on it, but that doesn't sound like the original. And it's off a compilation. It sounded a bit fast. I think the vocal was slightly different. If anyone can, you know, put me out of misery, I think it might be in a session of the time or something. Carl, is a little new year resolution for you? Another one maybe when we ask you to get a song, get the original single version. I could be wrong session. Yeah. It does seem different, doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we just remember it wrongly. But anyway, XFM for you. 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervaise. With me, Steve Merchant. Karl Pilkerton. Carl, you went to Lanzarote. People said, don't go to Lanzarote. They told you it was Lanzar Grati. They told you. Were they right or wrong? They were right. Yeah. Really? Yeah. It's a bit ropey. Yeah. Is it? Why? Just not there? If it wasn't for the. For the volcano they had, it'd be knackered. That's their. That's their big draw, is it? That's it, basically. That's all they've got going for them. When you landed, was it really hot? Did you initially, were you quite excited? You were thinking, this is a bit. Warm, you know, we can't complain about the weather. The weather was all right, sure. I mean, that's what I went for. But it'd be nice if. If there just was something else. Yeah. What did you do all day, then? Did you read your ritual book? Uh, no, I didn't read that. I read that book. Do you know the book that I bought? And all the chapters were messed up. Oh, yeah. I bought a better version of that. All right. And I read that. Excellent. And then it make more sense in order. Yeah. A lot easier to follow. Yeah. And then we went. Went another look at the volcanoes and that. They've got 36 of them to look at. How many do you look at before you realize that, you know, pretty much you've seen one volcano, you've seen them all. Probably about six or seven, really. And then when you go to the 8th, you thought, now I know what this is going to be, Suzanne. This is going to be like a mountain with a hole in the top. Yeah. Really? But it happened years ago as well. It's like, just keep a couple, fill the rest in, tidy it up. While getting some builders. No, seriously, though. Okay, 4 million tons of concrete, please. They're an absolute death trap. Yeah. What? Yeah. What do you mean? Philomen, do you know what a volcano is? Just old, isn't it? That's happened. Well, it's more than magma, it's more a portal to the magma in the center of the earth. Back in 1730 happened and they still haven't sorted it out. Well, when you say it happened, volcanoes were made a lot longer than 17k. But the one that did Lanzarote in. Right. Sort it out. What would you suggest? How can I fill it in? It's joined. It's all joined. The big plates of the earth are all joined. All the magazine joined with the. With the trade center thing that happened. They cleaned it up, sorted it out, was moved on. That's what I'm saying. Whereas Lanzarote have just gone, leave it. It happened back in 1730. You misunderstand me. How in the name of God can you fill in a volcano? You ignorant. No, but it's not just the holes. They've actually left the lava everywhere. That's what I mean. It's not just the big holes, there's lava everywhere. But it's molten rock. They can't just pick it up like they're like a carpet. Put it in the holes. The holes are there. Ready? Just push it all in. That's what I'm saying. What exactly is there, then? Is it just a kind of moon like kind of surround with just kind of dust and rock? That's exactly. You see, I was there when the Mars thing went wrong. I would have just sent a camera crew there, filmed a bit of that. Right. And so here we are. This is it. Ignore the little coffee shop in the background. This is Mars. Because that's. That's where it's like, just loads of dust. Yeah. Uh, holes everywhere, sign it up. Little round headed aliens complaining. Just like Mars. Yeah. So is any. What's the best bit about the holiday? Come on. Pretend you're Judith Chalmers. I have been doing. I would have done all that. I would have said that. Don't bother. I mean, the hotel was good. Yeah, that was all right. What was that like? It's all right. Just, you know, clean. That's all you want in it. See, that's not quite what Judith Chalmers does. Go, what's the hotel like? All right. Yeah. Clean in it. All right. But what was it like? Was it. What was it? Three star, four star? Did I have a swimming pool? Yeah. Yeah, it's good. You know, I think it was one of the better ones on the island. Okay. Nightlife wasn't really, really any. There was a bar, there was some bands playing. Yeah. Not very good food. Got a bit boring. Yeah. It was always the same food every night, but they sort of themed it and made out as if it was different. So, like, on mexican night, it'd be chicken with a nacho on it. Right. And chinese night, sort of chicken with a little prawn cracker on it and stuff. Sure. That got a bit boring. That's me just chilling on my phone because I want to read to you a text, right, that I got from Carl. I think you saw up the holiday in. In this text. Don't you remember? I can't remember. Let's have a look. Let's have a little look. What did Susan, your girlfriend, make of it? Similar view to you. That they should fill in the holes. Yeah. It's just that thing you see. I went on a coach trip, right, and you go and see the volcanoes. Like I said, it's 36 of them. Yeah. Which in. How many do you need? And when we're on the coach going round all these volcanoes, the fella on the front's going. And look at your left window. At the moment, there's a volcano. And if you quickly look out of the right hand side, there's another one. And on the left, he's just like, all right, we've seen it. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. And we'll talk about that trip in a bit. Right, this is the text I got from Carl, right. All right. Been up to a volcano, been in some dead artist's house who built his house in the lava. They said they would show me science with volcanoes, but all they did was chuck some water in a. In a hole and it shot up in the air. No dwarves in the canteen. No scousers here. But there is a swede woman with a big head. She looks effing gormless with a cap on. All right, so a little reference there. A swede woman. What's that mean? Do you mean swedish? Yeah. Or she looked like a vegetable. Swedish woman. But they all got so quite big bill, aren't they? And I said, I sent him a text. Oh, well, it's good to have beer holiday, because I know I'm working. He sent back. So am I. Just been watching Sky News. There is a school for monkeys who want to get a band together. Is that monkey news for later. Oh, my. Chorus on by Tim Burgess. I can't get enough of that. I love that chorus on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve merchant and little Carl Pilkington. But it was a nice holiday. Yeah, it's all right. It's just, you know, I went there to relax and that. Exactly. Did a little bit of that. Try to think of some new, you know, features and stuff. Sure. Always working. Always working. One big sort of, like, work thing to me and Steve. Work hard. You need the holidays. So, yeah, the things that annoyed me was like, you get bored, sat around the pool after a couple of days I'd read my book, you know. There wasn't much going on on the. Crabs through sand, that was crabs or anything. They wouldn't bother with lanzarote. So decided to go on a little trip. That's when I saw the volcanoes and that 36 of them. So we go on a trip. And the thing that annoys me, it does happen every holiday that you go on. If you go on a sort of package thing, you have these trips, right, and you pay about 40 odd quid and they give you some wine. So make it feel like you. You're getting your money's worth. But, uh. How many of these trips have you been on then? Uh, probably about twelve. Oh, more oddities. Now go on. I'll uh. Yeah. So you're on the. On the coach. Right? And they took you for the volcanoes. It took us in the middle of nowhere. Yeah. Right. There's nothing else around there. It's like I say, it's like Mars, but with holes in the ground. And they sort of drop you off and they go, right, everybody see you back here in an hour. There's loads of volcanoes for you to look at and a coffee shop over there. And you know for a fact, right, you don't need an hour there. You could just say, well, just keep the engine running because I'll have a look in this hole. We'll get back on. Give us five minutes. Don't need an hour. But you know, that's. They've got something going on. It's a backhand, definitely. What with the coffee shop. Definitely, definitely. Yeah. They. Yeah, they go there and they get everyone to have an ice cream and a coffee and they, you know, they sit down, have a fag talking to the bloke. Yeah. And it's like, yeah, cousin. Yeah. How much was the coffee? Probably about. Probably about three each euro. So I think it was 350. Sure. Which is. I don't know what that's about. Two and a half quid. Well, I remember we were on a family trip to France. Once we went to Paris, we got a coach coming back from Paris to one of the ferries, one of the ports, Calais or wherever it was. Coach trip. It was quite a long coach trip. And at one point we were thinking, we're on the motorway, this is fine, we're making good progress. Suddenly we came off the motorway. We must have gone like 40 minutes out of our way, end up in this street, completely empty little french town, and it's pulled outside this, what appears to be a restaurant. And a guy jumps on dressed like a butlin's red coat. He's french, but he's putting on a kind of english accent. He goes, hello. Oh, thank you very much. Top of the morning. Good morning. Hello. Come in. We've got food, drink. Go upstairs. We've got rooms if you want to have a rest or play around. No, it's up to you. And we wanted to funnel off this thing into this restaurant. And this one family went, well, we don't want to go in the restaurant. We brought sandwiches. We just want to get to the port. We're not interested. And they said, well, you've got to come in the restaurant. We don't want to come in the restaurant. So the guy said, well, I'll have to lock you in the coach. So this family were locked in the coach while we all traipsed off in. And I could just look, but I looked back and just saw this little kid with his face pressed up against the glass. I want to go in the restaurant. They were just stuck in there. I mean, absolutely livid as you would be. That's definitely a backhander. But we went inside, and it was extraordinary because initially you had to pass through a souvenir shop to get into the restaurant. And he just. Obviously, it was catered entirely to english tourists, so there was, like, pictures of the queen and Prince Charles on the wall. It was done out in a kind of mock Tudor style. It's absolutely extraordinary. I mean, it's just. It was almost. It was so bizarre because it was so out of the way. Did it come, did that come before the coach sort of scam, or did the coach guy, he knows it is a brother of his. I don't know how those things come about, but, yeah. Is that going on in this country? Yeah, I'm sure it is. Yeah, they say, yeah, I'm sure people say, look, look, if you bring 30 people to this restaurant, I'll see you. All right. It would, wouldn't it, if, you know, you got your favorites? Because you don't have to, though. The coach driver's pretty much God on those things because we don't know where they're going anyway. Yeah, but at least here there's all the stuff around. You don't really get that in the middle of nowhere situation in this. Well, not really. Not if you're going from London to Manchester. You could stop off anywhere. They don't know where they are. You know, there's places with nothing to do or see. It's that what, those attractions, they're all there's loads of. In America. But there's a. There's a few here like, you know, sheep world. And, you know, you go out to Gloucester and there's a town, it's got the biggest cotton reel in the world and there's. That's it. It's a tour shop, a big cotton wheel and some bloke at the gate going saquid to see it. There is. I went to a. I know it's quite a big. I went to a shire horse center once. Yeah, but when did shire horses become so, so popular? They got their own theme parks? Well, there's. I think there's. I think there's a museum for everything. Yeah, possibly. So. I mean, I don't think you could. You could think of somebody that didn't have a museum somewhere, Britain. Because obviously museums start off sometimes by fans, but people keep coming. I hear you've got a shire horse. I'd love to see it. Yeah. People coming all the time to see my show. You should get another one because I pay double money to see your shire horses. Yeah, yeah, shire horses. Have you seen them? They don't do anything. They're not like monkeys creatures. But you look at them in a picture or look at them in real life, pretty much the same thing. They're not saying anything. If they could train a shire horse to swing on a rope and masturbate, I'd pay double. You pay good money. I'd pay double for that. Yeah. There's a museum in Italy. When we went there a couple of years back, Susanna, that like one of those little guide things. Museum there just for spaghetti. I mean, we open a restaurant. Yeah. Interesting spaghetti. Spaghetti in different shapes. I didn't go. I went to see a big hole in the ground. Can't get enough of them. Well, but out of ten, then what would you give it? Out of ten? All food, food, location, relaxation, you know, enjoy. Sex. Okay, yeah. Next week. Where you going next week? You're not already. Next week? Susan's mom and dad again. Five oddities play record. You've got put some work in. You're in your thirties now. Got a knuckle down. Turing breaks mind over money. XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. Stephen Merchant. Little Carl Pilkington. Yeah. Yeah. A couple of emails. Different people have visited various tourist attractions. Oh, yeah. Let me see. Who's this from? Not quite sure, but thanks very much indeed for it. There's a link here. It's apparently in Devon. Barometer world. Brilliant. It's the world of barometers. It was established in 1979 by one. Bloke who had a lot and thought, I can charge a quid for this. Definitely out of his own house. Probably converted back scuttle. Yeah. That's not a euphemism for a sexual act. Look at the webpage here, Rick. There's a picture of a beautiful barometer being held by a beautiful lady. Lovely. Who's definitely his daughter. Definitely. Come on, Kathy. Oh, dad. No, come on, undo your top a little bit. Dad. Definitely made to do that. Yeah. Oh, that slight look of. I hope no one I know. Yes. Just check barometer world. Yeah. That's available. You want to check that out? Wwworld.com now, barometers do. Well, one. Do they work? Let's do checking. Is it the air pressure? Well, everything, but I think that's what it's based on, isn't it? So low and high pressure. So it's gonna rain. It's not gonna rain. Yeah. Or gonna be windy or. But I wonder how accurate they are. I think in the days before satellites, sort of weather surveillance systems. Probably essential. Yeah. Nowadays, as essential as hanging some seaweed out by the back door. Probably. I think it's probably similar. I think it's the same one as holding a needle and thread over a pregnant woman. If it goes clockwise, it'd be a boy. The thing about a barometer is how. How far into the future can it predict? Exactly. How do you know if it's a case? If you may as well stick your head out the window to see if it's raining. Exactly. This barometer goes, oh, it's gonna be windy and rainy when it goes soonish. So. Can't say, but it will. It will. Within seven days. You all have me. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, I'm just a bromer. I'm not really. I'm not really aware. Yeah. Brilliant. What's in there? That's what's happening in there. What's what chemicals are being affected and how does it work? I don't know. I assume it's probably some. Let me email. Barometer world. Not quite interesting. It could be mercury. That's based on a sort of temperature it goes up with. Oh, no, it's not temperature. Is it broma? It's pressure. So it's probably just very fine. It's like a fine, very, very fine needle, isn't it? This is almost as embarrassing as last time we were on. We couldn't figure out what the name of the leader of China was. Was it the king of China, the prince of China. This is where we're trying to imagine what it'd be like if all the chinese people at once jumped up and down and made big title. But if you do know what the name of the leader of China is, we don't mean the name of the particular person in charge. But if it's a king of China, the emperor of China, the Chinese. That was Japan. Yeah, this is it. I don't know. What's the big guy in charge? Is he still the chairman? I know Chairman Mao was important. I think he was just the chairman. I think he just governed all the big meetings. Yeah. I don't know, he just kept the minutes. Head Chinaman. Head Chinaman. The major Chinaman. The top Chinaman. Number one Chinaman. We. Do you know what? We're going to be honest here. We know so little about China. We know so little about China, it's embarrassing. If you've got any interesting facts about China, then Ricky Gervaisfm dot co dot UK. Also, I imagine the email address to use if you're going to take part in this week's rockbusters. I did. Really interesting fact. I'm doing a show called Politics and I was researching and there's a thing about sweatshops like Nike, there's these facts, right? And these people get like a few cents an hour and the CEO, I forget his name. For a chinese woman to earn his 5.2 billion, she'd have to work 8 hours a day, seven days a week for 10,000 years. But Steve, they don't. They don't. They don't. They? They obviously don't want to. Exactly. I don't want to. Lazy, lazy. Ian jury in the blockheads. Hit me with your rhythm stick, Rick. You like to be going to Cumbria on your stand up tour? Almost certainly not. Well, it's just because you might want to visit the Cumberland pencil Museum. That's the journey through the history of pencil making. I do like pencils. Really? Yeah. I just used one then. Do you have any idea how that was made? No, let me email them now. Chinese people. Oh, incidentally, it's the premiere of China, the premier. Premier. Oh, right, yeah. Oh, yeah, sure, yeah, I remember now. Yeah. Last. When you're away, Carl, we worked out if. If it's one in ten people are sort of like gay in some way, with a billion chinese people, there's a hundred thousand little, little gay, lesbian chinese fellows of some sort. Was it that? What do you mean? Well, if. I think so, it's some sort of form of gay osity, whatever it's called. It's sort of one in ten. Right? One in ten people are gay, apparently. Right. That does seem bit high, doesn't it? I thought it was. I thought it was lower than that. What, you mean more than that? Yeah, I think that's of any sort of nature, anything. But what time did they do the survey on the streets as well? Because, you know, they go out late, so if they're doing the survey sort of around lunchtime, forget it. They're not going to get any. Sure, yeah. I mean, they're all asleep. If I say one in the morning. Well, it's going to be higher, isn't it? Well, the thing is, you know Carl's favorite song, the killing of Georgie? A little fellow, a little gay fella, goes out and he gets beaten up and that Carl went, yeah, but would it have happened if he'd have been going out a decent time? True, but clearly in the lyric it says Georgie left the theatre before the final curtain. Foul. Yeah. Now theatre's finished about half ten. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So even giving him half hour, I reckon it was only about 11:00. So you're talking rubbish there. Are you sure that wasn't his curtains in his flat and he's closing them before he goes out? No, he was at the theater. But I'll tell you what I just realised somewhat, maybe where most people were going home after theatre. He was just going out. That theatre, to him, is like a matinee, isn't it? He's off out clubbing, isn't he? He's off down, he's gonna get some ammo, is a couple of butt plugs, and he's gonna. He's not even gonna start dancing till midnight, is he? Have any of us ever met any gay people? It's just. I mean, our view of them is. I don't know, email in. If you've met a gay person, tell us where we. Where we're going wrong. Yeah. Have any of us ever met a gay person? The way we talk about this, it's like, have we ever met chinese people? I've seen them. I've seen them out there wandering the streets, but I don't think I've ever. No, no, is the irony. I definitely know and have met more little gay fellas than little chinese fellas. Yeah. Have you ever need any little chinese friends? There was a. No, there was a girl at school who was chinese, but she was kind of inscrutable, couldn't get close to her. She was so mysterious. Rock busters. Yeah. Brilliant. Right, then this is where I give you a little cryptic clue and some initials and it sort of makes up a band or an artist and stuff like that. Sort of being the operative phrase. Yeah. Let's see how we read this clue. Yeah. This is gonna sound like Oscar Wilde. Clue number one. Three different clothes. Clothes. Chinese, apparently. It was legal then. Right, well, you leave the entrance to me garden alone. Sorry? Will you leave the entrance to me garden alone? Are we back on the gay thing or is this. This is the clue. That's the clue. Right, clue for rockbusters. Number one, we just leave the entrance to my garden alone. Right. That doesn't count because I know what it is. And what was. Sorry, what were the initials? What? The initials GG. Correct. Yeah. Right. But you've got to pronounce the artist correctly. I'll pronounce the artist because I know what it is. No, no. When the answer comes, I'll pronounce the artist. Right, can we just focus, please, on the quiz? Go. What was the clue again? Give it again. Will you leave the entrance to me garden alone? Not messing with it. Right, GG? Okay, right, next. Doesn't count. Next. Incorrect. Don't phone, but you can send the message on me mobile if you want. Right, that's t. It's another little easy one. And the last one, we were sharing out the mail sheet. Well, that doesn't count either. Can we just. I know what that is. I know what that is. I don't care. We'll come to that later, yeah. And number three, we were sharing out the male sheep and I think I got the best one. Right, DG. DG. Yeah. So quickly again, will you leave the entrance to me garden alone? Stop messing around with it. Yeah, GG, don't phone, but you can send us a message on my mobile if you want. Right, that was tea and the last one was sharing out the male sheep, and I got the best one, so that's good. Right, DG. All right, Ricky Gervaisfm dot co dot UK. Have we got any prizes? Well, don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Have we got any problem? Just let. The clues are rubbish. The clues don't work the show. It's. I mean, this is pathetic. Play record. That's why it should be called. And the clues don't work. Blair, out of time on XFM. Well, we're not out time. We still got an hour left, boys, luckily. Brilliant. A lot of emails, obviously, about the chinese people as fascinated as we are. I don't want to discuss it, you know, interminably. Rick is so much to say, and we've said most of it in the past. Yeah. Get a couple of emails. In fact, I think, Carl, you told us this information. Remind me of it again. If all the chinese people in the. World were in a line and that there's loads of them, you'd never get to the end of it. Right. No, it's not that. It's now, if all the chinese people formed a line and started walking out of China, you'd never get to the end of it. So I just said, no, it's because, though, they'd be having babies, you know, I mean, still, it'd be adding to it all the time, wouldn't you? But would they be. Would they be walking and jogging and having babies out there? Walking out? Yeah, that's. That is. Yeah. I'd love to see someone organize that. Maybe the record breakers team. I tell you what, I'd love to see Ross McWhorter or Norris, whoever's. Who is it? Who's the one that's alive? I forget. Norris, I think. Norris. Right. I'd love to see him coordinate that. Yeah. 1.2 billion little chinese fellows. Boy, girl. Boy, girl. Boy, girl. And where are they walking out of? China. Which exit are they taking? They're taking the Tibet. I think it's the. I think it's the gate nine slip road. The m 43. Right. To St Petersburg. Right. And they go and walking and. Shaggy. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Because some presumably are dying as they're leaving. No, but they live 220. That's true. So. So they clean. So you're. Well, we know Carl's there and that. Just tell new listeners your theory about when he's. When all these chinese people get the records for oldest people in the world. Come on, what's your theory, Carl? Carl. Just that they probably lie in. Why? Because a lot of them don't age that well. Some of them do love them don't. And they always look older than they are. I read the other day. Right, you know, the one who was the oldest woman in the world. Right. Chinese woman. Right. The way she did it, it was. She didn't die. That was. That was a secret, what she did. She got up every day and didn't die. No, no, she. She was awake and that. And then she'd have two days just sleeping. Right. So she wasn't really that old. What do you mean? Well, she'd only sort of lived half of her life in a way. No, but she. She was like, awake and that, and then she'd go, oh, bed. And then that'd be it for two days. Talking of sleeping, oh, man alive, I went to see the last part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Why? Well, it's like a family thing now. Every. Every Christmas, we, my family and I have been going to see the Lord of the Rings, the next installment. It's like a family thing. What will you do if they keep making them? Oh, I'd say I've wasted now about 10 hours of my life with that tripe. You can never get that. You can never get that back. That's what Peter Jackson owes me 10 hours now. He owes me of my life. It is absolute drivel. We've said this before. I don't want to harp on again about it, but I cannot fathom why everyone is so excited and loves these films so much. Like you say, people review saying it's the best film ever. I think this is the greatest movie I'll ever see, and I don't. It's like they go, but look at. All the fight sequences, hawking, being up there in literature, like, you know, I mean, it's sort of like Shakespeare, Tolkien. No. What is it that he's writing about exactly? Little midget fellas who can't get shoes. I mean, I've got big feet. I got size 14. I can get shoes. It's like Harry Potter taken seriously. But I know he's watching it. It's like these people are watching it, obviously. Nerds, people who live in forbidden Planet, they love it. They can't believe their luck, but it's. Obviously bigger than that. But then. But then it's also people who can think. They have a go, like menopause women thinking, well, I'll write a book. Then Globlin came into the cave, right? And they're sort of like 13 year old sons who've never shown an interest in anything except glue, now writes orc on his exercise book. And so they're loving it. It's like, yeah, it's uniting, bringing people together. But at the end, right? I mean, it's taken them now like 9 hours to get from one part of middle earth to the end, to the other end, so they can get. Destroy the ring, the evil ring. Did they do a line? I don't know what. They like, these little chinese fellas, and it's taken them 9 hours of their time and my life as well to get there. And at the end, they all seem to do it. In real time. Why don't they edit it? Oh, I mean, that's what it felt like. It must have taken them less time, you know, within the sort of logic of the book, to get there than it did for me to watch it. And in the end, they sort of say goodbye to each other and they all hug. So there's like, you know, there's little midget one, you know, Frido, Frodo, Frida saying goodbye to, you know, Bjorn. What are they? Because are they pc in it? Are they called, like, midgets and. No, they're called hobbits. Oh, are they? Yeah. So we should call small people hobbits from now on. That's what they are. Just to make it kind of topical. And they'll like that as well. Give them some, you know, so if. You see a little on the way home, if you saw a little. Just cool. Say, excuse me, Hobbit. Yeah. Okay. That's Frodo. He'd like it. He'd love it. Because everyone loves the Lord of the Rings. If you ever get to the end, they. They all hug each other. They say, well, basically, Frodo has to say goodbye to all these other little fellas. And so he's hugging us. I don't know how many of them there are. And he's hugging them, right? And it is the most interminable thing I've ever seen. It's like the music's playing. They look into each other's eyes. He hugs them. He hugs. They pull back. They look each other again. They're so we'll never see each other again. Then he hugs the next one. And I was just screaming. I was thinking, hug. Just one big group hug. Yeah. Then we can go like an american football team. Just go. Each individual. I mean, it's dragging on and apparently on the DVD, there's like an extra sort of 20 minutes of extra footage of scenes he's cut out. Who's watching this tripe? I don't know. I genuinely lost some of our popularity by slagging off Lord of the Rings. I don't care. Screw them. If you love it. If you. If you can't live without Lord of the Rings, screw you. I don't want you as a listener. I can fathom it, really. It's not like being. I'm trying to be wayward or controversial. I can't get my head around the popularity. Doesn't Harry Potter annoy you as well, though? Yeah. But is it. I haven't seen it. The toilet. Three times during the course of the film. Really. It's unbelievable, woman. Some of those little pictures with the pointed ears, it just took me back to all, you know, Mister Spock. Oh, all those glorious days. It really is just. I mean, have you seen any of them? You've not bothered? I've seen one and it was long and I thought it was nicely filmed and I thought, well, okay, I just get through it. I think I even think I, you know, it was just a list of. Oh, and here come the orcs. Exactly. Right. Okay, we see the orcs now. It's like people can't look at the amazing fight sequences, the amazing immense battles. And it's true. He's got thousands of actors and stuff on horses. Brilliant. But I'm not impressed by good time management. Well done. He's got all those people together. He's orchestrated it. Well done. But it's gotta be more interesting. My friend summed it up. He said that the wilderness films, they're like the film equivalent of an Enya song. Yeah. And that, to me, is exactly right. Lots of billowing dresses, slow musical moments. That's good. Majestically on horsey and. Yeah. Constantly riding majestically everywhere. Dido's taken over menu in that. I've got a confession to make. I like that latest Dido song. I know, I know, I know, I know. I thought I'd never. I don't know what to say. Let me explain to me. Oh, God. Bite in bottles. Richard Ashcroft on XFM. We've had an email which I think, I suppose, puts my hatred of Lord of the Rings into perspective. It says, yeah, you may have spent 10 hours of your life wasting your time with Lord of the Rings, but imagine how many hours of people's lives we, this show have wasted. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. 2 hours a week for a couple of years. We can never give that back. I know. It mounts up, doesn't it? We should be doing some kind of community service for people, you know, maybe pop around. Well, this is community service in it, because Carl, it makes his brain work a little bit and it, you know, keeps him. Keeps him, you know, from going on holiday. So for 2 hours a week, which is good, we spent new year's Eve together, me and Carl as. Me and jane, Colin, Suzanne. Her hair doesn't really like Daville, I must confess. When it was done, though. Yeah, she had the coat on that you bought her to say sorry, though, didn't she? And martin freeman and his girlfriend amanda and Glynn. And we all went for a meal and then we went back to ours. And so in the new year and all that and all the fireworks and then in the wee hours when just the drinking seriously starts, we started playing parlor games. And do you know that game when you go around started off like with them pop bands or rock bands, you have to say a band and then they have to come up with a band immediately that starts with the letter that your band ended with, right? So suede erasure, do you know what I mean? Go round. And we did that, right? And then we change that because people would sort of using the same ones crop up. So I said, well, let's do animals. We're doing animals. And I gave Carl one. I think Carl panicked. Yeah, do it quite quick. I want to just test it on you. Okay. Um, is this bands? What was it? Uh, I said, now, what did I say? Uh, so we are. So basically I said an animal and it ended with e. Okay, so I go, I go skate. Eagle. There you go. Yeah, but hang on, I think I was the third person, right, so think of another one. Eel. Yeah, I had that. Yeah, I did that one. Right. A lot of ease coming up. Elephant. Do you know what Carl said? Go on. Ready? Yep. Egg. Oh, innocents, I suppose. Egg. He went, yeah. I went, no, wrong. He went, and then Martin caved his rescue and went, well, what is an egg? Animal, vegetable, miserable. I said, well, it's animal, but it's a. We can't have egg. Would you allow the tadpole? Well, yes, yeah, stage, yeah. No, but egg, you might as well have leg or eye. Uterus, it doesn't count. Egg, you panicked. Brilliant. Oh, I still think I'm right. Well, you're not right. We were naming, you know. Exactly. Yeah, why obey the rules? Exactly. Yeah, that is true. That is true. You had the fireworks in the year, did you? Yeah. What, you had them yourself? No, no, you could stare across the river, we could see them. But actually very impressive. And I'll tell you what, they got it right this year. Instead of 2 hours of letting off fireworks, we were going, oh, can we go now? It was three minutes and they spent a million pounds on the three minutes. And that's it. That's all you can stand, three minutes of fireworks. To me, fireworks are like watching lord of the rings. Exactly. I've never been impressed a child, I've never been impressed as an adult. But a big bang, a huge, big explosion, that'll do me. I used to go to, they used to have little community fireworks displays at Christmas, things like that near our school, maybe in the school or at the local kind of community center. And I used to go along to them with the family, everything, get the sparklers and they would have the fireworks. Oh, and that would be. And I just bored to me. And I always thought that if the guy organizing it had wheeled out an enormous firework, climbed in, gone last one to the moons of Ben, and then shot off, that I'd have been. Yeah, very good. Yeah. Do you reckon I could take out that chair? Church? Yeah. Money on it. Go on there. Yeah, that'll be worth it, wouldn't you? But little zoom. Another one. Oh. So a friend of mine was telling me that they once had some indoor fireworks, which apparently it's just. I mean, imagine that. What. Who needs indoor fire? Well, I think that's just little. Yeah. I think one of the things we got indoor fireworks once when I was little, and I remember one of the fireworks was that little celluloid fish that you put in the palm of your hand, of course. And he goes, oh, you're sexy. Yeah. What, it curled up because the heat of your hand. Yeah. Oh, you're dead. It didn't curl, actually. It's granddad, he's dead. His hands are cold. Oh, no, that's the only way that that would be. Oh, yeah. So that's the only test. How did you discover he was dead? We used one of those predictive fish. It came out dead. Yeah. Just flapped. Yeah. Do you have a good time, though, Carl? What, your place? Yeah, it was good night, wasn't it? We danced, didn't we? A bit of a dance. Well, the two of you together. Yeah. Amanda had got one of those DVD films. No, straight to, you know, DV. It goes straight to DVD. Yeah. Amazing, right. And Carl was doing his moonwalking. I was sort of doing some sort of jazz step, wasn't I? Sort of like Michael Jackson. I ended up jumping up on the couch with both feet and falling straight back on my back. Course you did. I can't believe I was alright. Yeah. What's the chance of that? Is when you're drunk that you sort of, like, you revert to childhood and you sort of bounce. Yeah, exactly. So luckily, is that DVD gonna be. Available in the shops later? Track one side won the first Talking Heads album. Uh oh. Love comes to town on XFM 104.9. Yeah, well, I think it's rockbusters result in it. Okay, all right. Brilliant. You want the prizes, by the way? Not really. No bothers. No. Some videos and DVD. Couple 499. Is that one titles. What is the weather one that's gonna be on telly. Donald McIntyre. Oh, yeah, that's. That's in there if you want that. Yeah. He reckons Donald Mackenzie Richmond. Because he did a thing about how much it costs to have a chimp. Cheapest chimps. What was the other thing? You think someone ripped you off? Rock busters. Ken Bruce on radio, Tuesday. Songs of phrase. He was doing that over Christmas. One week off, he's in there. And when he heard that Donald McIntyre was doing a program about wind, he thought he was moving on. Auntie. Auntie Nora. So the first one, will you leave the entrance to me garden alone? Right. That was the cryptic clue. The initials were GG. Yeah. That was Gareth Gates. Gareth Gates. Gareth. Gareth. Gareth. Gareth Gates. No, no, no, it's Gareth Gates, isn't it? So why would you say to someone, Gareth, is that, like. What's that a man thing when you say Gary. Gareth Gates. Gareth Gates. Yeah. Gareth Gates. Yeah. Gareth Gates. The bloke who came second in. Pop over here. Gareth Gates. So that's the first. What's that about getting off the thing, though? Leave me. Leave my entrance alone. I don't understand why it's got to do with leaving me entrance, Gareth. Got to do ignorance. Don't phone. But you can send me a message on my mobile if you want. The initial was t. Yeah. Texas. All right. Just. No, it's text. The words text. So you'd have to say, text me. Texas text. What do you mean? No, text me. What's that? The third one was, we were sharing out the. The male sheep and that I got. I got the best one. BG. Right. We're sharing out the male sheep. It doesn't work anywhere. Get to it. What is it? Delta. Good ram. Delta good ram. You were dealt a good ram. Delta good ram. All right, so who's the winner? We're gonna give it to Stephen gunning from tooting. He's got all those, right. I don't know how, but well done to him. And he wins some crap in a jiffy bag. Literally. You two on XFM. Snow patrol and run on XFM 104.9. Yeah. So everyone had a good Christmas, though? Yeah. Really, Carl? Even though it was like, a little bit lands a grotty. It was a nice Christmas. What was the book you read, by the way? Someone just emailed and wanted to know. What was the book you read? It was the governor. The governor, yeah. Okay. Did you buy Suzanne a gift in the end which she. You surprised? Yeah. After that show that we did before Christmas. Yeah. I was walking on thinking, oh, as we'll treat then. Yeah. Went and got her a necklace. She. She said she wanted a necklace, but I didn't know which one. But went and got one. Yeah. And she was happy with that. Yeah. That shut her up. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And did she get you against that? She did get me something, yeah. See, I knew we knew she was. Yeah. But the thing is, right, she got me a little game Boy advanced second holiday. She knows I get bored, love. Right, so that, that was good. But I was like, hang on a minute. And how much I spent. Oh and I know how much these are, right. But I was clever though. When I got to the airport, I bought to get me an extra. Get. Bought me an extra game for it. Yeah. Got the value. Of course. When you were growing up, did you wait to ask your mum for sweets right at the counter. So the woman sort of would sort of embarrass her into getting you it? What, you mean just slip it in the basket? Well, no, just go. Just wait. Wait till there's some, you know, a stranger watching. Before you ask for sweets. Did you see it in front of Suzanne when he got Sir Suzanne, can you get me some oscars? Remember I bought. Spent more on that necklace than you did. Like game boy advance. And the woman in Dixon's goes, oh, you better get him some house. She goes all bloody hell. All right then. No, she did well though. She's done well to keep you, hasn't she? You're such a fine. You're quite a catch. Yeah, you. She must wake up every morning, go, oh, I am the luckiest girl in the world. She told you that the other night? What she said the other night? How good it is living with me. Yeah. I said to Suzanne, it must be great because I only see him 2 hours a week and I like to squeeze his little head. You can do that all day every day. Does she ever squeeze your head? No. No. It's like that thing though. And it's like when you work in a chocolate factory. You get sick of it, don't you? It's there all the time. Yes, you must think, well I could squeeze that head anytime I want. It's not worth it. I just. Yeah, my dad. I'm wondering if you're turning into my dad cuz he bought my mama bracelet. He won't mind me talking about this because he said you'll probably talk about this on the radio. And you're right dad, I am talking about it. He bought my mum a little gold bracelet. Lovely, lovely gift. You know, it was a lovely thing. And she opened it, she loved it. And everyone thought, what a great gift. Lovely gift. He wouldn't stop talking about it. He wants something like the gift he bought. He kept on grabbing my mum's arm and showing it to people. Look at that, look at the gleam on that. Look at the shine on that. Look at the gleam there. Look at that. And you know, he said the great thing about that's pure gold. He went, it's an investment. That's an investment. You know, it's always worth something. Gold. I love that. When people get gifted, I love it. Does it take away any of the romanticism of it? But it was the way constantly was talking about how great a gift it was. I haven't, I haven't heard the word gleam for 30 years. Look at the gleam on that. The gleam. Look at that. Look at the sparkle on there. Look at that. It looks like rope. That's how you get it. Looks like rope. Looks like gold rope. And he just, I don't know, I disappear. We open the gifts, he went, disappear. I could hear him in the kitchen going, think about that. That's pure gold, that Elaine, that's pure gold. I might melt that down. Yes. John, next door, next door neighbor John, look at that. Look at the shine on that. That's great. That's brilliant though. But it's just, it doesn't it sort of undermine the gift of it if you keep on drilling on about people. If people enjoy giving. That's nice, isn't it? And you got, you know. What did your mum say? She can get a word in each way. That's a step up from a jar of coffee though. And it is a stuff up. Yeah. That's good. What about yours? Didn't get my mum done anything this? No, cuz I'm always treating them anyway whenever they, you know, if they need a few quid. Well, you are the gift that keeps on giving, Carl. No, but don't just go given anything just for the sake of it, you know, I mean, wait for the time. That's right. Sort of thing. Just please Christmas. Because. Yeah, there's no better time, is there? Really? No, just was gonna say my mom, dad didn't give me anything, but they did. What they? Just some money, but I'll get them something when the time's right, you know. I mean they always need bits and pieces through the year. So. Yeah, I'll look after them. Sure. But um. It was weird being aware, caught on to the fact that, you know, they leave groceries in the. In the telephone box near your dad yet? Still going on, is it? Oh, that's fantastic, isn't it? That is just fantastic. So when he needs a loaf of bread, pint of milk just goes down, does it? Does he ever give that gift? Listen, are we doing the film thing in a bit? Oh, got more prizes. Yeah. Is it better than rockbusters? It's all right. I did it in a bit of a rush because I was only in yesterday. Wanna. Sure. Take three holidays a year. Then there's not enough time for the work. Me and Steve like to, you know, put our priority into, you know, doing the work, coming up with a good product and getting a holiday when we can, you know. We haven't. I haven't really. For me, it's for Susanna. She's the one who likes going away with you. Just go. Yeah, so I'll go with her. Do me bit. When you were playing game Boy, right, and you'd looked in the hole and you're reading your book, what is. What is she doing? She'll sort of. She'll make things seem more interesting to me. Do you know what I mean? So, like when we're at the hole and the bus driver said, you've got an hour here. I said, why have I got an hour here? I go to a funeral with someone who I loved in the ground and don't spend an hour around it. Why do I want to. Why do I want to spend an hour looking in this? Wasn't that terrible when your aunt just shot up in all this magma? Yeah, that was terrible, wasn't it? That was the worst funeral you'd ever been to, wasn't it? But she'll tell you, that would make funerals more interesting, if they just. It was a cremation and a burial. Yeah. You just put them in a volcano and they go, two, three, here they go. Wee up to heaven. I was having a conversation with my flatmate about songs that would be inappropriate to have at your wedding, at your funeral. Horny. Surely, as well I'm horny. Horny, horny, horny. Isn't Robbie Williams Angels? One of the. Yes. Biggest. And I think wind beneath your wings. Yeah. I think he's apparently quite popular. Oh, yeah, yeah. Play that. All right. You know us. Boston. Yeah, a bit of. Who busted. Busted much more than Boston. More than a feeling. XFN 104.9. Well, another big moment here. We've had rockbusters. Now we're gonna have Kyle's film quiz thing. Innit film quiz thing. I've done Planet of the Apes, right? Because one of the things we did in Lanzarote went on this tour with three northern blokes and they didn't really know what they were talking about. Joking. You're joking. Northerners not knowing what they're talking about. You're having a laugh. They've obviously sort of not had much luck here, right. And thought, let's go over to Lanzarote, buy some vans, get people in it. We'll do a tour of the island. And whenever someone asked the question, like, what year did the volcano happen? They go, oh, it'll take you to the visitor centers. You can read about it there. So they never actually answered anything, right. So they were useless. But one of the things that they told us was that planet of the apes was filmed in Lanzarote. Right, okay, that makes sense. A bit of it. Well, does it make sense? Well, no. I mean, if they wanted to show sort of an Aaron, sort of barren, sort of post apocalyptic sort of subject, choose where you went. Are they? Yeah, obviously. Yeah. But when. When we were there, he took us to this sort of beach and I said, is this. Is this where they did it? And he was like, yeah. I said, what? Right, right there. Yeah. And I watched it and I couldn't see where I was. Yeah. You know that if you watch a film from 1968 and you've been to the same place, you're not gonna feature, you're not gonna see you in the back walking along the beach? It's a new one. New. New planet. The eight. Oh, the recent planet. Yeah. Yeah, that's what they said. Yeah. Right. Right. So I thought I'd sort of. Now that sounds a little bit more far fetched. I thought, that's probably a lot in Hollywood. Yeah. Well, anyway, is this the current planet apes or the old one? You've done current planet, the apes? This is the recent one. All right. There'll be a question at the end of it. So listen on that. Is this entertaining to anyone? This? I mean, just. Just take the last four minutes of conversation. But seriously, Rick, who cares? I don't. Do you know, I don't DVD selling well. Exactly. What the. I care. All right, go on in. All right, so find out the apes question at the end of it. Listen, win some stuff. All right. Hey, where am I? What is this place? Hang on a minute. Hello? According to the Lanzarote guide, we've been dropped off at the volcano bit. Apparently there's 36 volcanoes there to be seen. I hope you don't mind my saying, but this is a waste of time. Don't know why they need 36 volcanoes. Just keep one. Fill the rest in like a car park or something. Excuse me, guide. What's the bus? Dropped us off here. What's so special about this place? Well, according to our holy writings, that is where creation began. Where the almighty breathed life in the time before time. It's amazing that in it all this has been studied for years and years. What about the coffee shop there? Is that old, is it? Well? Well nothing. You're about to rip us off. I raised about four quid for a coffee there. Always ripping people off. That's what annoys me with these trips. You get us in the middle of nowhere, we die in a thirst. I'm not able to do without the reason I've come here. I believe this is where they did Planet of the apes in it. Love monkeys. Especially the ones in Planet of the apes because they talking that talking monkeys can't exist. Joking, aren't you? Of course they can do all sorts of stuff. I read about a monkey the other day who worked on the railway. Right. There's another one about a chimp that did a bank job and went off to Spain to sort of. Shut up. What is that little monkey fella? It's come from that little coffee shop. It's been serving coffee. Now that is worth paying four quid for. No, you're teasing him. I'm not teasing it. It's working, isn't it? Serving the time. We want some coffee. Get some coffee. I've heard about this. You can buy. Can buy coffee. That's been sort of hand picked by monkeys. Like coffee, mate. Except it's more coffee. Primate. Yeah. Hello, little fella. We want coffee. What do you mean we? You know. A coffee. Aren't you? What else are you gonna do? Go look at another 35 volcanoes staying here. I'm having a monkey coffee. It's brilliant. You find this amusing? Jesus. It's a talking monkey. All right, mate. Have a couple of coffees. Don't start now. Duty. I'm starving. What's meaning you're off duty? Have you bananas later. Just get us a couple of. I understand that you're tired and you've probably been on your hands all day. Just forget the coffee. You go and get some lunch after you've got some. Coach your lazy ass. You damn human. Powerful. Lovely. Excellent. So what's the question? If you've been listening to the whole show, how many volcanoes do I thinks on the island of Landero okay, yeah, I might have it wrong, what I've been saying, but it's roughly around that. Yeah, yeah. So what have you been saying? Yeah, yeah. Ricky Gervais at XFM co dot UK. You're more likely to win the prize if you leave your address on the email. Yeah, because otherwise we can't really be bothered to phone people or email them back. Good point. Put your address on there and you could win some crap in a jiffy bag. Carl's theme tune there, Sivo special needs needs Alex FM 104.9 New year's resolution. Carl, I don't know. Start smoking. Do you mind? There must be something. No, it's a waste of time. Don't bother with that. Me? No, I've never really made any news resolutions, just. I just be good to people. Just treat everyone as you want to be treated yourself. Give to charity, hate, crime, racism, famine, sexism. I know you're gonna keep to those. Except the gift to charity, that's we. Kyle, find that a little bit hard to believe. Never gonna happen. Well, you've always gotta break at least one of you. Exactly. Yeah. Well, I think I'll be nice to Carl. What about learn more? I was thinking that I want to know. I watched, I tell you what, Christmas telly was dreadful this year. Actually, I don't know if I've hit that age where I think about. I think consciously I thought, this is worse than usual. And I ended up watching that Discovery Channel and History channel again. And I watched four episodes in a row of this fantastic documentary, 1418 war, narrated by Dame Judi Dench. And it's brilliant. I just can't get enough of it. I hated history at school and now I want to know everything. And I think that's mine. Learn, learn all this stuff about stuff, learning. Now, I always say that to you. I'm always looking up stuff. When I was on holiday, even though it was sunny outside and they had big holes to look at for what to. I stayed in and watched discovery there and was watching stuff about scorpions and that. Yeah. What did you learn? Nothing. It was all in Spanish. What I don't understand is we're scorpions, right? They have like this, this sort of weapons, don't they? They have the poison and stuff, right, which can kill a man. Yeah, but there was a couple of little animals and that. That were its sort of enemy. Yeah. And it stung them and it didn't kill him. So what's the point? Well, firstly, not all scorpions can. Some of them there, yeah, they range from, like, bee stings to so much venom it can take down a horse on. On things like spiders and snakes and scorpions. So it depends. But a scorpion that will kill a man would kill a rabbit. So I don't know what you're talking about. There was a snake that it stuck its thing into and some sort of beaver and. And they were just like, running about. There's nothing funny about that. So why we laugh? Well, the snake wasn't running about, was it? Well, it slithering about a bit, yeah. What was the beaver doing when the. Snake just sort of, I think, at it in the end. What, at what at? The scorpion just wandered off. Well, it wasn't a beaver. All right, an otter. This is what you pieced together from. A show in Spanish saying, though, how come it can't kill something that small, yet there's someone on holiday that's no sort of danger to that scorpion. We're not going to arm it. Right. And yet it can kill a man. But I don't believe it. Sharp, mate. Seriously, this is gobbledygook. Taught you something again, though. That's what I'm saying. What have you. What is. What is that? What is the fact that's come out of that? A scorpion can kill a man, but the beaver was dancing with a snake then you do. That's not a fact. New Year's Eva taught him something, right, about dead people. No, you know things that taught me. I was saying. You're talking shite. He says they found out your soul weighs an ounce. Your soul? Yeah. Your soul ways now. Find this out. I read it. You are soul ways now. Yeah. There's no such thing as soul ways. An ounce. You're talking to nivel. Have you got any monkey news? So what they do, they measure. They weighed someone who was alive that would wait for you to die. Then why are you again? Someone. There was someone. You've lost an ounce. Yeah. So it must be your soul shooting off to heaven. It was someone who was really ill and he said, we can't do anything for you here, but we've got a bit of an idea that we want to do. Stuck him on some scales. He said, right, you weigh nine pounds and an ounce or whatever, because he's wasting away. He died. Nine pounds. All right, fine. Well, that's proof. If proof. We needed monkey news. Leave it. Come on. Come on. Tell monkey. No, this is nothing that great. Really. Is it worth playing the jingle? Quickly. Go on, then. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey news, right? It's about four, four, four. It's about this. This woman monkey was born in 1834, right? Half monkey, half woman. No, not true. It happened. Apparently, it was in the Daily Mail. All right, okay. The victorian ape woman was a name. Yeah, I christened this thing victorian ape woman. Well, we thought Sandra. No, I'm calling it victorian ape woman. She was about four foot. No, didn't happen. She had lovely thick black hair on her head and on the back of her legs. Yeah, yeah, all right, save stockings. And she didn't need a bustle because of a huge ape like ass sticking out the back of her dress. Who's got up reading and sewing? Wells were good because they didn't have opposable thumbs. She didn't speak three languages. Yes, human, monkey and monkey. Human. 20 offers of marriage. Does that annoy you, Steve? Ah, absolute twaddle. But more rubbish than your soul weighing out victorian monkey. See you next week with some more twaddle. I was worried we wouldn't have the old magic. It. Merry New year.",

Coach trip. It was quite a long coach trip. And at one point we were thinking, we're on the motorway, this is fine, we're making good progress. Suddenly we came off the motorway. We must have gone like 40 minutes out of our way, end up in this street, completely empty little french town, and it's pulled outside this, what appears to be a restaurant. And a guy jumps on dressed like a butlin's red coat. He's french, but he's putting on a kind of english accent. He goes, hello. Oh, thank you very much. Top of the morning. Good morning. Hello. Come in. We've got food, drink. Go upstairs. We've got rooms if you want to have a rest or play around. No, it's up to you. And we wanted to funnel off this thing into this restaurant. And this one family went, well, we don't want to go in the restaurant. We brought sandwiches. We just want to get to the port. We're not interested. And they said, well, you've got to come in the restaurant. We don't want to come in the restaurant. So the guy said, well, I'll have to lock you in the coach. So this family were locked in the coach while we all traipsed off in. And I could just look, but I looked back and just saw this little kid with his face pressed up against the glass. I want to go in the restaurant. They were just stuck in there. I mean, absolutely livid as you would be.",
