Not like that. I mean, we were taken aback. Speak for yourself. Yeah, and we've got guests. Jonathan Ross one. And he has guests. So we're gonna have guests in, one of which is sort of a tie in. He's gonna explain himself. It's Doctor Fox. Doctor Neal Fox popped in for a chat. It's a pre record. We got that. Although live in the second hour, we're gonna have a chat to the girls from tattoo who are upstairs at the moment in capital. And they're gonna. They're gonna pop down and have a little chat with us. So we're really trying to, you know, make this more of an interactive show. We don't know yet whether we're going to give up or not. It depends how this show goes. Yeah, look forward to that. But we've got some great. We went on to the big library, so we don't have to rely on four non blondes and the, you know, the two jam tracks that are up here. We went down to the big library and we've got some great tracks. Steve, haven't we got some classics? Should we play one now? Well, before that, I just remember that some of the criticism we received, I think, was that we're perhaps not taking into consideration the listeners. A lot of shows, a lot of radio shows, they cater very much to the community, to the area which they're broadcasting. They interact with the. With the listenership. I'd just like to justify why we don't tend to correspond or interact with the listeners. Here's a typical email from Vicky, age 25. She asks, do you ski, Rick? That's her question. No, I don't ski. Yes or no? No, I don't. No, you don't. Right, there you are. Thanks, Mick. Brilliant. Keep those coming in. See, now he's turned him against us. Carl, what do you think, Kyle, what do you think of Steve's attitude there? Black? Great. Cut. His heroes next FM one at 4.9. I'm Ricky Germain. With me, Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington. Okay, proper, proper radio. As you know, we're a bit gutted that we won nothing at the Sony Awards. We found out that on the panel was Doctor Fox, probably one of the greatest dj's in the world, one of. The great living broadcasters. I certainly think he's up there with Tarrant Jonah Coleman. And so we asked him to is also on the pop idol panel so he can make and break people. So we asked him basically to explain himself. Why did we win nothing? Why were we so bad? This is what he had to say. The award, guys, was called the entertainment award. Now, in itself, I think that should probably tell you something about what should be on the tape. There should be some entertainment and it just wasn't very entertaining, actually. I don't mean that sounds quite horrible sitting here in front of you now, but it just wasn't very entertaining. But fundamentally, what, what elements did you not find entertaining? The fact it didn't seem entertainment at all as part of it. I mean, it's a bit of a. Like Helen's a piece of string, isn't it? What is entertain? I've talked about string on the show before, though. There are loads of people I'd never heard of in my life and some of those were perhaps a bit more entertaining than you. The people that got silver, I think they were called Joe and Twiggy. They worked for a station in the Midlands, I think, Trent FM. They were actually pretty funny. Funnier than ours. Yeah, they were actually. Yeah, they were funny. And they seem to seem to sort of understand their local. They seem to understand their market a bit more. Then I got onto yours, I think. Oh, great Ricky face. Yeah, he's really funny in that program, isn't he? I must watch that. I'm gonna absolutely die laughing here and. Oh God, it was painful. How would you improved it? Just listening. Bit of humor, be quite a good bit of humor. Essential entertainment. Show a bit of prep, you know, get in there and actually think about what it's gonna do. Perhaps. Well, thank you, Doctor Fox, for your honesty. We've got to the bottom. While you're here, can I just show you this? That lump, do you still do prescriptions? Doctor Fox? There he was, you know, he's honest. He was blunt. He was blunt. You know, that's. I'd like a second opinion. I'm only joking. He's not actually a doctor. He used to be called Doctor Fox and now he just calls himself Neil Fox. I think he's been struck off. No, he's Neil Fox MD. Right. He's just. I wondered if there was some malpractice. That something happened a little bit there because Froggy will not take that lightly. Who? Froggy. What do you mean Froggy? He's doctor Frog now. He's changing. He hated Fox, but are we gonna. Heed his criticism because it was about. There was no preparation, we weren't funny. Fair enough, yeah. There's just really no content we didn't care about. We didn't care about the show, the. Demographic we were meant to be aiming at. Just sounds like a lot of work, all that. Well, I think what we can do is we can take all on board and immediately forget it and carry on because it's easier. What about that? Brilliant. I'll tell you what we could do though. Play some bloody great tunes. Thanks very much. Athlete. You got the style on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Kyle Pilkington. All right, brilliant. Well, you know the funny thing was the, the day of the Sony's, the radar figures came out. That's the body that tells exactly how many listeners you've got, etc. And XFN went down a little bit across the board, except one show, Steve, that went up 34%. Keep talking. Well, what show do you think that was? Christian Connell breakfast. No, it was this little mother of a show. Really? Up. Yeah, 30 hours went down. We went up 34%. Yeah. So maybe Doctor Fox should be listening to those figures. Indeed, yeah. We get a pay rise. Will we get a 34% pay rise, Carl? Oh, that's way equid a month for. The last like two years there's been nothing there. And you've still been getting the same on him. That's the way it works. There's been what, though? You're not paid per listener, are you? It's just, you know, me. It seems like it. I think they've each given us five pence. Exactly. I went along to. I came in for the presenters meetings, this. I've never a presenters meet. I didn't know they existed. And I just came into annoy car, it was about five to six, so I was going to get him as he knocked off. We're going to have a. Sorry. And the presenters meeting is what? That's where they dish out which amusing news stories they're going to read out, is it? Yeah. No, no. What order they're going to play athlete. Coldplay the vines. And I went upstairs, people were there and. Quite interesting, wasn't it, Carl? Yeah. You know why the figures went down a little bit. Go on. The war. Is that what they said, the war? Yeah. At one point I said to Carl, just how many listeners died in this war? Cause I thought he was saying that they were at the front or exalm listeners went, well, I'm going, I'm going to a lac. Well, the reason our listeners tell Zoe. To tape it for me, the reason. Our listenership went up, is that. That just tells you who's listening to us. Cowards. Yellow bellies. Children, women. People with fallen arches. Terrorists. Oh, dear. Yeah, I didn't. I didn't. I. It was quite a good meeting. Now, I saw some. So what exactly. Is there anything I missed out on this? No, no, they just, you know, it went. It went down a little bit. Except our show, which went up 34%. Up 34% with no awards. Remember that? And then you went out. You went out afterwards, didn't you? Uh, yeah. Went to, uh, into bar to have a couple of drinks and that. Yeah. And then, uh, a few of them went on to, uh. Onto string fellas. No, they didn't. No, some of them did. Zoe did. Zoe. And, you know, a few of the office people and that. Yeah. To what? To watch lap dancing to be. Yeah. That's what goes on there, isn't it? I know it's mad in it. Have you? I've never been to string photos. I don't know what. But. No, what? Why? Why would they? I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I was talking to people about it the day after and they said, oh, you missed out? I said, well, did it? So how does it work? They said, well, you know, you pay. Never quite understood lap dancing. Never quite understood. It was. It's basically someone dancing naked, rubbing their ass in your face. Yeah. That's basically the gist of. Is it? But you. But you can. The rules is you can't talk. Do they do a home service? I just think it's just. It's nearly. I've got. Be careful. I say it, but it's sort of, you know, I'm not dissing swing fellows or anything, but it's that. Not sort of like one step down from prostitution. Doesn't antiquate, what, 19th century? No, but I mean, what. What it's like, it's. Well, I don't quite understand it. I have you. I don't get it. I don't get it, because the thing is the. I said, how does it work? They said, you pay 20 quid, you get some clean money. Sort of like little vouchers that you stick in the knickers or whatever. Oh, God. Clean money. Yeah. Disinfected money. Okay. I just like vouchers. Can you put loose change in there? Because I got a lot of that. I owe you. Yeah. 20 quid it is. Right. And I just don't get it because, I mean, I'm not tight with money or anything, but you pay your 20 quid, they dance in front of you, but you're not allowed to touch. Which to me is like going to a restaurant, ordering a nice big warm dinner, and they put it in front of you and it's like, well, you can't eat it. And you're saying, but it's going cold. I love the idea of some bloke sitting in string fellows, businessman, right? Basically pounds. There's an ass waving his face and he's going, can I not just. They go, don't. Turkey goes, it's going cold. Look at it. It's going cold. Oh, that is brilliant. It's going cold. That is. I mean, see, Carl in the week was saying that he doesn't like sayings and phrases and metaphor and analogy. And I was going, you know, and he thinks it's sort of like, you know, one step away from poetry. But he comes out with the most evocative phrases. That is a straightforward analogy. Lap dancing is like being given a meal that you can't eat. See, that's, that, that's great. That's how you saw it. And that's so much better than saying it's. It's mad, you can't touch or it's a waste or. You see what I mean? I was, I was trying, we were trying to inflame his enthusiasm in the week. And I said about different phrases and that he goes, well, why not just say the actual words? I was going, well, it's more poetic. And I told him the Isaac Newton one, if I have seen further than any other man, it's because I've stood on the shoulders of giants. And I said, well, that's because, you know, he's saying, you know, I'm getting lauded for being this great scientist and all these discoveries and being a genius, but I'm saying, you know, if it wasn't for those scholars before me that come up, what they come up with, you know, I wouldn't have got this far. Karl went, what did you say? I just said, well, I prefer him to give me a name check. Do you know what I mean, though? If he stood there and he's saying how good everything is, don't just class me. Don't sort of put me in a load of other people. Give me a mention if you were. One of the other scholars. Yeah, yeah. I think there were probably people that died sort of years before him. I think he's saying more that he's thanking the body of work these scientists and these great men had handed down, you know, through either books, material, teachings. He's not giving a big shout out to the collective science posse. Yeah, yeah. You know, thank you. Actually, I copied Nigel's. He's not saying that. I was. I was like, here we can. I heard what Nigel said about it, about the third law, do you know? I mean. Yeah, I mean, I look into sayings and stuff. Go out more and see if they work. Well, one. One that happened a couple of weeks ago. Right. You were talking about the. You can't. You can't have your cake and eat it. Yeah, well, I never understood that because I thought, well, what's the point of having your cake and I in it? Rather like your lap dancing analogy, but it actually means you can't have eaten your cake and still have it there, obviously. Well, the time that I saw that same work. Right. I was it. I was in Asda with Suzanne. Yeah. And you know those big binders you get with nice cakes in them. Yeah. For birthdays and that you can get one with like David Beckham on the front of it. Yeah. Have one with, you know, Thomas the tank engine. If you want Ricky Gervais. Yeah. You can have one of them. And I saw one of those comedy ones where it is like a big pair of breasts. Yeah. And that is when, you know, you can have your cake and eat tit. Play record. No, but. Play record. There we go. I want to talk to you about. It, about pans placebo, this picture with the androgynous vocal talents at the helm there of Brian Maloco on XFM 104.9. Yeah. Broadcaster excellent. Did you see, I think. I'm sure. I don't know if Carl saw it. I know you watched it, Rick. The extraordinary. It was a Sky one tv show the other night. It was something like reality tv. And it was about basically what the fortunes. Get enough of it. The fortunes of various reality tv stars since they've come out of the show. Christine Hamilton coming out of the jungle. And obviously, once again, always a pleasure to find out what Fats Waller is up to. Rick Waller. I mean, he's in the band now. He's got his own band. He was playing in some club in Rochester. There was about 20 gospel, sort of. Gospel rock, that sort of soul gospel rock thing, like something you see in the commitment to summer. And when it cut to the audience, it was like. It was in Butlins. It was just a big dance floor and there were just people watching differently. And he went, the people that were here loved it. I mean, it's really. And that's tough to say. The size of the man, his leather jacket, Karl, was extraordinary. I don't know how many animals had to die to make it. It was like, you know, it was. If he'd have fallen off, it'd been like the Hindenburg. Yeah, because it was like a zeppelin. Oh, the humanity. I still think when I see him wearing a kit like that, it looks like he is stood on the shoulders of two other people and it's just a joke. It's like a circus act or something. Yeah. Cause his head doesn't make. It doesn't make sense. Looks like it's one of those things that you steam yourself in. You put your head out. That is that machinery. No, it's a cool. Or one of those old fashioned iron lungs. Oh, dear. There were some magic moments, but there was a grind. Because once again, I mean, I missed a lot of the first series of I'm a celebrity, get me out of here. But it showed once again the moment with Darren Day. Darren Day, a lovely guy, but that moment where he went off and sat on a rock and came back and he'd written a song, I know, which he just. And I can't. It was also. It was also things like, I'm in a hotel room in another town, okay. And it was just. It was like something you'd write when you were 14. It was unbelievably when they showed it again. It's just stunning. I love songs you write when you're 14. It's like your first sort of, like, song. You could, you know, you know, three chords, and it's always. It's always stuff like, there's a man, he's a lonely man. Take a look at him. He looks a bit like me. It is me. It's that sort of thing. Like, we want to play with someone and you want them to go, my God, you're deep. My God, you're brilliant, aren't you? And that's about you, is it? Oh, yeah. I have to say, this is such a terrible confession. When I was doing a school play once, when I was about that age, 15, right, there was a girl who was in the cast with me, and she sort of, you know, she was giving me the eye. I was thinking, yeah, well, I kind of thought she was right. And glass. But there was another guy. There was another guy there as well. I was sort of competing for her affection. Oh, no. And he was quite witty guys. His name was Scott Hanson. He had long blonde hair. Exactly. And I thought, well, the way to impress her, because I was 15 or whatever, I thought I was pretty smart. I sat in one of the adjoining dressing rooms reading a copy of the philosophical book Zen in the art of motorcycle maintenance, which I didn't understand, but I sat there reading it in the hope that she would walk in, think, my God, you're reading Zen in the art of motorcycle maintenance. You don't go with the crowd. You don't want to come next door where we're talking about nonsense and people are flirting. We're talking about the bangles. Yeah. You're in here saying, look, just, if you want to come and talk to me, you're welcome, but I'm a thinker. I bet you thought you were quite Chan Cane, didn't you? I thought it was like she'd think, jesus Christ. I know. I've never met like him. That is genius. And she. I remember what? The one time she accidentally walked in, she went, oh, oh, sorry, wrong room, and left again. And that was it. Sorry, at 15. So this is about the time you took to wearing a bowtie. Bow tie. I love that. No, I used to watch a lot of Harold Lloyd films, and he was. I love the idea of 15. You going, well, it's time I went to wooing. Right. Right. On with the bow tie. Where's the Zen. Where's the pipe in my bow tie? It's a dime. I got me a bow. I love that. But songs are great as well. The other thing you do, so when you're about 1516 is start writing songs about, like, the world's trying to take a piece of me. Hey, you think I'm going down, I'm coming back. I'm against the roach. They try to drag me down. It's like, you want to be cool, Han Lu. Yeah. They put me in this emotional prison. The man's on my back. Who? They try and take a piece of me. Who? Who do. Wow, you're 14 parents and that, don't they? The teachers? Yeah. I absolutely love it. I still remember a poem. I like to say his name. We're about 1415 and this. We had to write a poem. And everyone's was pretty rubbish. But we mercilessly took the piss out of this bloke because I still remember the poem. And how he did it is he went through a dictionary and found things with that. And this is a poem, right, okay, remember, I've remembered this for 25 years. Right? The reason why. The reason why? The reason why I had to die did I bleed the blood of greed? What was my destiny? And when we were this, we were laughing. I mean, for a year we would go, what was my destiny? It was just great. The reason why the reason why the reason why I had to die did I believe the blood of greed? What was my destiny? Oh, that's almost as catchy as monkey news. Oh, God. Oh, I've got some monkey news for you. Let's play a record and come back. And I've got some great monkey news for you, pal. Pass from the REm album that people tend to forget about now because it was so kind of poppy and such a massive hit out of time, but there are some good tunes on it, and there's one of them near wild heaven. Excellent. On XFN 104.9. Carl, watching a program yesterday, and it was about these japanese snow monkeys, and it was all about how animals learn things that aren't instinctive, particularly sort of primates, because they see other people doing it and they start a culture and they can pinpoint when these monkeys, when one monkey first went down and got in the hot water springs and stayed there because it was hot and the others copied them, and now it's a, it's part of almost a culture, you know, that won't be handed on because not distinctive, but has to be learned each time. And, you know, and they, they groom. That's normal, like other monkeys, right? But they're really intelligent. And obviously the reason they groom other people, other monkeys, is because they eat the mites. But also the monkeys have learned, they like being groomed. Okay? So they showed this one monkey, it went to a deer, okay? And it was grooming this deer to get its mite off it, right? But then it didn't eat it. It held in its hand. It went over to a monkey, put the mite on itself to show the monkey had a mite and got a free grooming. That's extraordinary. That's extraordinary. That is extraordinary because it gave up the food, knowing that if you put one there, this monkey would look for mites on it and it would get a free grooming. And it was like having a little massage. What do you think? That. It's not bad. I've got some better stuff coming up. Later on monkey news, on the official. Yeah, did you see that? You see what? Mine, though. Mine's true. And that's an interesting and extraordinary actually. Happens in social behavior amongst primates. So I saw it. I saw it was, you know, did. It rob a bank, Rick, at any time. It didn't rob a bank and it didn't open the hairdressers. It's not quite good enough, is it my monkey news? See, the difference where I named the species explained it slightly, told you an interesting fact. As opposed to there's this monkey, right? And. Yeah, it's not interested. Can I try and describe for people the face that Carl has? I'll tell you what it's like. It's like if you draw some eyes and nose and a mouth, a balloon, and then inflate it to about half full. That's what Carl's face looks like. That's what his head looks like. It looks like a face you've drawn on a balloon, very small, the rest of the head huge. It's just that today I'm a bit tired. Right. That's one thing. Why a bit tired? I just haven't been sleeping. Right. Why not? I don't know. I've got a lot going on in the head. Oh, this would be like the Simpsons. If we could actually look in there. There would be two monkeys grooming. Now. Plus you've been talking about like, stuff that I can't relate to. What, writing poetry. Like what? Reading books, poetry and stuff. I never did any of that. What did you do? Well, at school they didn't, they didn't bother. They tried to get us to write more. Right, right. By giving you a pen. They used to give us these school diaries. Yeah. Little, little red book. And it was a way that they kept an eye on what you were doing out of school hours. Right. So some kids would write down, you. Know, stole a bike, burn the house down. Yeah. But when I was at school, around that sort of twelve age, I didn't get up too much. You have no money. There's no you can do. So every night it was the same thing. I'd get home and I'd have to, I'd have to go to the shop, right, and get some potatoes and some bread every night, right? And I kept taking this into. So what was it, Dublin in the 17th century? What do you mean? Every day you went to the shops and got potatoes and bread. That's, that's kind of what I had to get all the time. Why? What did you have? Chip sandwiches. So you went to the. Yeah, you went there. So I kept. With your hoop and stick. I kept putting that in the diary, you know, every night saying, went to you phase. That was the name of the shop. What is it called? You phase. What is it you or you like h u g? H u g h? Yeah. Oh, that was his name, you phase, right? Used to go there, get the potatoes and bread. Bread and that. Someone who's named a shop after themselves, I'm not going to say what we sell, it's named after me or nothing, or I'm not opening. Mainly potatoes and bread. White sliced loaves king Edwards and the. Teacher used to always say, just write something different in there. Make something up. Because, like, you know, Monday, Tuesday, all the way through to Friday, every night, it was. Just went to, you faze. Are you sure it wasn't an advert? Sure he wasn't paying you to say, get my name in the book. The only time that it changed and she said, oh, that's. That's made it a bit more interesting, was when it was me birthday and I had to buy a cake, potatoes and a cake. And she said, oh, that's good. Yeah. That was my 13th birthday. My mum said, I got home from school, she said, oh, you're 13 today, teenager. Big, big turnover. Go and get a cake. That's your experience of writing? No. What? No, that's your experience of your 13th birthday? Oh, by the way, your 13th day. Go and get a cake. Yeah. Brilliant. Big surprise. Was it a big surprise? Yeah. That is brilliant. I love it. Writing. Well, they never asked you to write essays or stories. Did you never write a story or a poem or. The stories I did earlier on with, you know, you made them up, but it was that thing that I'd always end them with and an alarm went off and it was all a dream. Every single one of them. Yeah. Yeah. But they didn't. I mean, it was a bit of a. Potatoes and bread, but did you ever do anything that write about an adventure when you're a spaceman or you're in, you know, you were a cowboy or. No, all the teachers, like, had scams going on. So, like, in English, right, you'd go in there and the teacher would say, right, what we're doing today is got a load of brochures from Thompson, but they say, like, 1983 on the front. So I've got a load of stickers here that say 1984. Let's see how many you can do in half an hour. You are joking. Did you go to school with Oliver Twist? I'm sorry? You are joking. I'm not. That's what they did. So the teacher must have been getting like a freebie or something for helping them out. You. Is this honest? Honestly? Yeah. That's what is fantastic. They were all other than Mister Fagan you had. Yeah. And then when they saw karate kid they had every kid washing their car. Go. Wax on, wax off. Hurry up. I'm teaching, I'm teaching you some that. Wax on, wax off. Paint the fence. So I'm just saying, you know, that's, that's why I'm a bit quiet because you're talking about stuff I can't, can't relate to. And why, and why didn't you sleep last night? I'm just, I am slept well for, since I was about twelve. Do you sleep well? Wait, wait, wait. You can't let that go. I haven't slept well since I was twelve. What do you mean? You know like a proper. I used to love going to bed as like a kid. Yeah. Whereas now it's like oh, am I gonna sleep tonight? And I sort of wake up about four times. Whereas when you're a kid. I remember really loving like go out of bed. There was one time where I actually laughed myself to sleep because I couldn't. Believe me. Look, when you're really tired and you get in bed and the pillars. Yeah, it's all cold and it's like. I can't believe this. Yeah. And it happened twice. Once when I just went to bed and I was really looking forward to it. And also when I helped my dad out once, like through the night, he worked at like at this paper company, right? And I helped him out and I got in at about four in the morning with him, got in bed and I just was like, I was laughing my head off. I had to put the pillow over my head because I couldn't. Believe me. Look, I was like oh, this is great. This. I'm going to sleep. I just have to say, life up north is so extraordinary. But you must be the easiest kid in the world to please. No wonder she knew she could just go get a cake. It's sort of like what, what was he expecting to say? He were expecting an extra hour in bed but we got him cake as well. I met without any supper. Brilliant. Brilliant. Yeah. Your own bed. How long was it before you got your. What did you used to do before? Just some straw in the corner? No, just that, that thing of when you're really tired and, and do you. Ever do this with Suzanne then? Do you ever love yourself to sleep with her? No, that's what I'm saying. She can't sleep because you're chuckling away. I'm just, I don't know what's up with me. I've got a lot going on. What do you mean you've got a lot going on? I don't know. I was talking to the security bloke before saying, do you sleep? Have you got much going on in your head and stuff? And I don't know. He wasn't insulted by that. I'm sure, going up to someone and going, have you got a lot going on in your head? That is brilliant. It worries me. It's interesting that your lack of sleep coincides with the diaries and the writing of the bread and potato story every day. I don't know if once you had that responsibility. Why don't you every night go to Hugh Fay's, get some bread and potatoes? You don't have to eat them. Then go to bed and I think you'll be chuckling yourself to sleep in no time. I'm stunned at Carl's rudeness. Okay. That's badly drawn, boy, by the way, all possibilities. There's a lovely chapter. Just calls in saying about sounds and Carl, because the records end and he doesn't say, oh, I've got to go. The records end. He went, yeah. And he. But, so just check if he still there. He doesn't want to be on radio. He said he didn't want to be on the radio, but I think he apologized. I'm still here. Hello? Hello? I'm still. I did ask not to put live on Friday because I get very embarrassed. Don't worry. All we want to think is just wanted to apologize for Carl's curtness and his rudeness. Now all I want to say is the station is good because you couldn't have a worse slot on a Saturday afternoon, right? Because the youngsters are in the boozers, the older fellas are doing the punt, in the racing, the football and whatever. The thing is, the state you play, if you want, if you want to. Get number one, if you want to. If you want to be the top, all you got to do is start playing Natalia and Bragley and this and have your audience with one puke of hair between four legs. Okay, thank you. That's why they want to go live on radio. But you are. When Christian got a little bit sick about being 13, then he got to go. Whatever you're. The sound is stationed in the area you cover. I don't like all the stuff you play. The station plays, but you're actually doing what's there. Thank you very much. Keep going. You keep going. Persevere. And you might be. It's well worth listening to anyway. Okay. Otherwise, can you hear us? Thank you. Bye. I mean, I can see why you cut him off. Stop it. We've had so many calls. Carl was getting annoyed. There were so many calls. And we've had suggestions from Ned saying, talk about Jimmy Savile, John in north London. I've just got John in north London. What does he want to talk about? Oh, forgotten Becca from Liverpool wants to talk about Tracy Emmon and Damien Hirst are Paul Andrews. Your mum called. Stop calling her. Turn her to listen to XFM. Yes, you. Paul Andrews is about 38, at home with your wife and kids. Your mum just called in. I think someone wanted amazing monkey facts. I can't even do this right, can I? To be honest with you, last week we were slagging off Carlos being the weak link in this show. I think it's clear what the weak link is. Oh, God. Who's the bloke who wants Hailey to go with him to X Men? See, I shouldn't make notes. What's wrong with you? If you didn't spend so much time squeezing his head and eating pies, we might get something done. Right, okay, then. What should we talk about then? Play a record and we'll discuss. Make your bed. Make your bed. David erst. Stop cutting up sharks and things, Picasso. All right. Right, rock busters. What we got for us, Carl? Right, there we go then. Three clues. Clues. Couple of initials. Email in Ricky Gervaism dot co dot uk. Win some stuff. Do you want to go through this stuff? You get them. You're definitely improving yourself as weeks go on. We've got a three CD set of the best of inspiral carpets. How do they strangle it over three CDs? I have no idea. Yeah, I know. Extraordinary. A number of other CDs, all of which are okay, plus a t shirt and a copy of Marion Jeff series one on DVD. Not bad at all. In an XFM band. Well, he's noticed X Men two isn't there because it's not out yet. But it is at the cinema. I think Hayley should go with what's his name. Shut up. Okay, right. Go on, Carl. The clues are clue one. They're having problems. I tell you what, I think Foxy was really soft on us. I think he's. Oh, go on. This is what we're tuning for. Okay, so this is brilliant. Come on. This is like, who wants your millionaire? It's. Come on, Karl. Don't worry about him. He doesn't know. He doesn't understand radio. Kyle, I heard his show before he had us. He was doing it sounded just like Doctor Fox. Yeah, go on, clue one. They're, they're having problems. The. Got any rice? Say it again, and say it like it's written down, right? Say it like it's like you're reading it as opposed to making up as you go along. I know you are, but say it again because all the Ums and R's people think are integral. They're having problems. Do it again. They're having problems. They haven't got any rice left. Cryptic clue, every word that's the matter. What's the initial? Cc. Cc. And the clue again? They're having a few problems. Second one, the Geordie fella doesn't know what he's been charged for. Okay, what's the initials there? Dwight? Oh, Geordie fella doesn't know what he's being charged for. Right. And the final one, if he had two bricks and he had to throw him at two women, right? You gotta go through this without going, right? Oh, yeah, just do it again. Just say again. Think what you're gonna say, then say it. I have two bricks. Oh, no. If I had before. Well, I've got. Stop it a minute. Stop because I'm gonna burst. Right, Carl, work out what you're gonna. Say and say, okay, just calm down. We just don't know. Calm down. Okay? Right. I had two bricks to throw at two women and I didn't hit either of them. The initials. Mm. Right, so quickly again. I've got that and it's brilliant. That is a brilliant one. Okay, right, they've, they've run out of rice. They've got problems on their hands, CC. Right, the second one, Geordie fella doesn't know what he's been charged for. Right. Bw. And they had two bricks to throw out. Two women. Didn't eat any of them. Right. That's. Mm, brilliant. Ricky Gervais, brilliant player record, win some stuff. White stripes, seven nation army on XFM, one of 4.9. Carl, are you thinking of starting a family? Only if, like an accident happens or something, yeah. Were you there, Rick, when we were chatting about this the other day? Oh, yeah. What did you say? Well, we're talking about his career and that because he's on MTV. And I was going, oh, you got to do this now? He's going, look, if it happens, it happens. I said, I've said to happens, it happens because what your plans are saying with enough kids. And I go, look, if it happens, it happens. I go, well, how would it happen if a condom splits. Amazing. I love the idea that that's the way you plan for a child. Imagine telling them that. When. Where was I conceived? Can't remember. The condom split. Yeah, you're an accident. I love that. The romantic nature of that. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. But do many people sit down, say, right, do you think we should. Yes. Worse. They lay down. Yeah, I'm busy. You can't play. You can't sit down. You have got time for that discussion. No, it doesn't mean the conception. I think it means bringing up a child that's 18. But the thing is, as well, it's one of them in it, it's like if you think about having one, you go, well, the sort of negatives, you know, outweigh the positives, I think, right. But if you have one, you go, oh, it's not that bad, is it? So what are the positives and what the negatives. Like? I say the negatives outweigh it. I can't think of that many positives they get in the way, don't they? Mm hmm. Cost you a lot. Cost a lot of money. Same with marriage. Like Susan saying, we get married. So what for? Well, marriage doesn't cost anything. Well, it does. Well, no, and if you go to the registry office and then buy a house. But then what's the point? Well, tax breaks, you know, presents. I don't think you get them anymore. Don't you? I looked into that. You are romantic. Well, draw. Have a ring or a 3% saving. I love it. I love it. Well, yeah, I don't see the point anywhere. I got down on one knee and presented with some Inland revenue forms just to show the benefits. That is great. I mean, if you are planning it, I think you got to involve me and Steve in the radio station, because it'll be. I mean, you take quite a lot on, don't you? So if you've got a kid at home and you're not, and you're not sleeping up, slept since you're twelve, you've got this, you've got MTV, you've got a kid, you know, it might be one step too far, because I wouldn't want. I wouldn't. I wouldn't want to push you over the edge. No, I just was gonna say, I was talking to Susan last night about it and saying, you know, about earning money and that. She said, well, you're ready. Sort of earn a little bit more than me. So, you know, if you get loads of money, she said, I'd be happy staying at home and doing nothing, maybe looking after a kid. I said, oh, so that's not happening, right. I said, I could have a load of money now tucked away. I could have won some money and I wouldn't tell you. I still want sort of that check offer every month because I get a check offer to sort of pay the bills. Yeah. And I think you need to keep that in a relationship. Sure. Do you know what I mean? Work as a team? Yeah. Yeah. That's not working as a team. Of course it is. Well, no, you share everything. Sharing everything is working as a team. Whether you earn most 35 grand back. It's not like you think that. Oh, no, I won the polls, but I give her off. She gets lazy. She just sit around the house doing now. So she's still got to go to work in a job she hates. Yeah. I'll tell you, though, she thinks that it'd be the worst thing that could happen if we got a load of money because she'd want to go to Egypt. I tell I'm not going. Why would you want to go to Egypt? I don't. That's what I said. No, why would she, why does she want to go to Egypt? She wins a lot of money. She said it's meant to be pretty good. So the incredible wonders of the pyramids and the sphinx and so on, that's not of any interest to you? I've seen it, though, on the telly and that I don't, I don't, yeah. I don't want to go all that way just to see it. Exactly. Right. Exactly. That's experience other cultures of the lifestyles, travel, broadens the mind. Well, seen enough different ones here. In here, there's parts of women oh, you haven't seen yet. Yeah. Okay, well, so you're, you're, you don't want to make enough money. You don't make a lot of money because you're worried that Suzanne might want to go to Egypt. And then that's, I'm making a lot of money. I can still tuck it away. Right. And what we do with it when easy, when you turn up in a big converted limit goes, da da da da da da da da da. Come on, we're going to bingo. Where'd you get the car from? Never the mind. Right. What? Won't you be suspicious when you've got a pet chimp? You know? I mean, what are you. I mean, yeah. What would you spend it on? Is there nothing that you want for? No, I've never. Now this, now at the moment, honestly, it's, it's, I'm quite happy. I mean, I don't ask for much. But you're not happy. You're always whinging and moaning, always whingeing. Clearly there's something wrong. What if someone gave you what? Okay, right, let's, let's be serious. We don't talk about billions, right? But if someone gave you a cash injection, just a one off cash payment of 250,000 pounds. Okay, what would you do with it? I mean, that's too easy because that should obviously be a house. That should be the best house you can find in London, probably what I. Go and see a tornado. Right, that's on your list. Okay, so it's so, you know, in many ways he's so sweet, but you, I want to shake him. Can I just point out to you, Carl, I don't know if you know this, but if you get caught in a tornado, you do not whisk off. Into the magical land of Oz and land somewhere nice. Yeah. And crush it still in your rocking chair. Yeah. It doesn't happen. It's quite dangerous. But you go into tornado number one. Fair enough. Number two, what brochure is that in that one? Texas in it. Okay. Oh, number two. So he's got tornado number. It's Kansas, I think, mainly. Well, can I just, I noticed someone's emailed here a link for. Can you believe you luck? Monkeys for sale. Now I don't endorse this in any way, but here you are. Here's a monkey for sale here. Oh, that's terrible. $2,500. It says, male, very smart little guy, loves to play and gives kisses, wears diapers and clothes, has been around lots of people and loves them healthy and loves to eat. Sounds like Ricky. It wasn't carved. It says it loves to be around people. Yeah, there's a gibbon there. A given full price. You know, it's like that, uh, Donald McIntyre program. He did that cheapest chimps program. He didn't do cheapest chimps. He didn't do a program called Cheapest Chimps. Saying that. What? He didn't. There's at no point did Donald McIntyre do a program called Play record a minute. Play record. Oh, cracking tune now if you're down. In Texas chasing your tornado, this would be on your stereo. Surely, surely. If you're in Alabama, it'd be in equally. Doesn't even go to Alabama. Texas, that's what the tornadoes are. Do you not listen to what he says? Kansas. It's Kansas. Lynda Skinner, of course. Sweet home Alabama. Always worth a play, I think maybe once a month. Yeah, brilliant, Carl. We're talking about having kids and stuff. I've always been quite thankful that Ricky's never wanted to have kids, because I just think he would set the worst example for a child that he possibly could do. Just in conversation the other day, just happened to mention that he's taken to eating in the bath. Well, let me explain some. Let me explain some. It, right, I've got busy schedules. I get up, I meet Steve at a certain time, and I go, oh, I've got to go at 330 today, Steve. I'm working out at four, I work out four till five. I have to have somewhat to eat before I go out and off and meet Johnny for a beer at six or somewhere. I thought, oh, God, if I go around and have a bath straight after, then I have something to eat, I go, well, I got. Sometimes there's chicken legs and they are greasy. So one day I thought, hold on, I'll go to the bath with the chicken legs, I'll eat them in the bath. And it's brilliant. So I'm sitting in the bath, I eat the chicken egg, it's really greasy, right? I just throw it in the bin, go under the water, come up, I'm clean, I've eaten, I'm clean. I get dressed, I go out and meet Johnny, I've lined my stomach. And the good thing about that is that when I come home after beers and I'm eating the chicken, I go, there's only bread left. I just wipe it around the bath. I got a lovely bread and dripping sandwich. That's not true, that bit. But I do. I do eat in the bath. I mean, the second week of doing it, I was just eating in the bath, I think I was in chicken legs again. I'm eating the bath, Jane walked past, just looked in at me and she went, Christ, Caligula. What? Just a fat roman emperor eating Caligula. To be honest, is just too cool and impressive. Not Caligula, old man. Step toe. Have you seen the one where he's in the mouth eating the pickled onions? No, he sat in the bath. He literally sat in the bath eating some pickled onions. Some of them slip under the water. He fishes them out, put them back in the jar. I'd never do that. No, you what? You'd eat them. But it's the fattest chicken. It's big, greasy slabs of chicken. You're throwing the bones on the floor. No, I'm putting them in for the wolves to scavenge. Stop biting your nails, Carl. Not only can you hear it, it's really rude. I don't know what. Yeah. You're criticizing him. Yeah. Criticizing him for biting his nails. Yeah, you don't know where they'd be. You eat chicken in the bath and then go under the water and come up clean whilst sat in some water swimming with grease and fat and chicken bones and breadcrumbs. Well, I like to bath. I look to bath two or three times a day. But do you not see why that's not cool and impressive? It's not like we're all gonna go, why haven't we all thought of that? To be honest, though, Steve, that is the only time I eat oranges. I know what you mean. Yeah. Yeah. That is. That. That's. I've always thought that an orange. I. God, this is too annoying. And I don't bother. I don't bother eating oranges unless they're tangerines. You can peel them in when I put them in one. I do not. I don't have big jaffers. There's just not. It's not worth it. What is wrong with you? Firstly, have you ever thought about cutting an orange into four quarters with a knife? Waste. What do you mean, a waste? More washing up. Yeah. Right. So this is what you got. This is why you can't sleep at night, because you're thinking, I gotta run a bath and have an orange. I've got time. I'd love an orange now. I need the vitamin C, but I gotta run a bath or at least have a shower. I could be in there with another man. The two of you are just. You are like children. You're infants. Your mentality is ludicrous and you're embarrassing us in front of our special guests. Oh, yeah. Now, of course, last week we've been tattooing. We've had a number of letters, Rick. I'm just reading them now, saying last week, loved your interview with Chris Martin from Coldplay. Genius. Another one here. Great insight into the man who wrote yellow and clocks. Fascinating. Steve. Merchants interview with Chris Martin was amazing. He showed his own tv show. Just some of the letters we've received. So this week we're very lucky to have with us russian pop act tattoo. Round of applause for them. Lovely to have them here. Tattoo. Now then, of course, much contrast, much controversy that your kind of lesbian shtick is just something to try and whip up some press attention. Yeah. Yeah. We are proper lesbians. We love fanny. More than cock. Okay, brilliant. And tattoo, lovely to have you here. Thanks for coming. Now then, you've got some live gigs. I understand plan. Yeah, duh. Okay. I can help but notice that you sound, dare I say it, tattoo? You don't sound so much russian as German. No, we cannot do the accent properly. Okay. And Tatu, it's joy to have you. Thanks for coming there. And finally your lesbians. Could. Would, for instance, either myself or Carl be able to convert you from. We like the muff so much that the knob is no good for us. All right, well, thanks very much, Tatu. Yeah, thanks, tattoo. Thanks very much. Cheers. Next week, share. Brilliant. So if you've got any guests, special guests you love us to interview, then let us know. Ricky dot gervais dot co dot UK. And we'll try and get there. Oh, dear. Player rockbusters answers next. I was going to say, well, do you want to do that? No, let's do it next. After the. After the record, what are you going. To say about gays and that? What? Martina, top bird need one on XFM 104.9. Right. There goes the girls from tattoo. See you later. Well, thanks, girls. Cheers. Carl, what were you saying before we cut you off? Yeah, it's just that, you know, you had the girls in and out and it reminded me I was talking to Steve in a week. Yeah, I think. I think it's when people were talking about going to string fellas and that. Yeah, I was talking about seeing naked people. And now, yes, I asked him, I said, when he used to watch, say he accidentally flipped onto BBC Two and some ballet was on, would his eye ever been drawn to maybe the gentleman's. Lower regions, the gentleman's package? Yeah. Would your eyes ever be accidentally drawn to that and you couldn't resist it and you said. And you said yes. Yeah, because. Right. Oh, dear. Well, go on. I mean, fair enough. I'm always looking at the beautiful ladies, but fair enough. Yeah, no, go on. But. Testicles. I went, I went out. Have you ever looked at Wayne sleeps? Penis and testicles? I went out on a night out. Right. And it was some. It got to some point in the night where two women and two fellas got on the stage. Right, right. Started stripping off. Yes. Just what members of the audience. No, no, I think they were like part of the act. Right, right. And what was his pento they downed? You know, the fellas were. I'd like their undies on and the girls just had the knickers on. Yeah. Sounds pretty erotic at the moment. Gone and at the same time, they all whip the pants off. Yes, it bucks fizz. Wasn't it the adult show? Now, I said to Steve that point. Sorry, I wasn't there. He said, it's three later. I said, yeah, well, you have a. You have a quick glance at the fellas. And then the annoying thing was you sort of. I thought, right, now I'll have a look at the women. And it was too late. They put the knickers on. How long were you looking at the feathers? Not that long. But why are we looking at them first? It's human nature in it. Why? I don't know, but I'm sure you would have done the same thing. You just sort of think, well, how are they shaping up? So what was the. What was the. Who had the biggest knob? Which one of the blokes had the biggest knob? No, it's like, you know, normal. This is a whole new side of you. This is a whole other area. So you look at ballet dancers, you look at the gentleman's. No, I don't. I just was. When he said this, it reminded me of this night when I was walking home thinking, no, think. It didn't get a look because it was this. What event was this where people are stripping off cow? I tell you what, you are the most interesting man I have ever met. But are you comfortable being nude? Enough. We've done this. Well, I don't know what this is. We did this last week about. Are you comfortable being nude? You probably most comfortable being nude. It's just probably not in public. Well, Ricky's only really comfortable nude when he's eating. Yeah, yeah. There's nothing to get, you know. Yeah. You can just wipe yourself down. Yeah. Just sit in the bath. Yeah, no, but I've talked about that. And then when I went, when I went home, I was talking to Suzanne about. And she said, what's all that about? You know, you don't like being nude. It's not. It's like I'm part of an Alan Bennett play. It's just I love the way you talk. Remember once, right. I don't know if you should talk about this, really, but. Well, that means you should, so go on. Go on. Oh, yeah, right. We went to. Went to Tenerife, right. One year and I'm still living in Manchester. I'm thinking about Susan, but she's. I don't want to know anything about Suzanne. I'm just explaining to you that I don't like being nude. Yeah, so you're in Tenerife. In Tenerife, right? Didn't have much money. Stayed in this apartment that wasn't, wasn't that nice, right, at the cockroaches in it and stuff, right? Didn't have much money to go out at night. So we're in this sort of death trap of a, of an apartment, right? Anyway, it's when I was younger, right. And a bit more energy. So. So, you know, start having it away a bit. It's a joy. Beautiful. So, you know, doing what I do, right? Yeah. Someone starts banging on the door. So everyone's at it. Right? So you mean knocking on the door, right. Knocking on the door. Right. So Suzanne said, you better get it. So I said, I can't get it now. I'll have to wait a bit. I can't answer the door. Go. So the banging is getting louder. Yeah. Someone at the door, yeah. And she's like, oh, no. But it must be important. In a minute. Just. So anyway, open the door. It's a fireman. So I just stick my head round and he's going, you'll have to get out. The building's on fire. Right? So I'm like, in a minute. Sorry, you weren't still having sex at this point? No, no. But, you know, I still sort of gotta wait a minute or I can't get my pants on. Oh, Carl, I wish I was. So sorry. Go on now. So the place is burning down, so. It could be a serious big fire going on. Yeah. I'm sort of waiting. You can hear people sort of screaming and that panicking. Is that because the doors open and you're nude? Fire the fireman saying, will you get out? Will you get out? I'm saying in a minute. Right. And Suzanne was saying, you know, think of something that's not sexy. Sure. So I was thinking of people, you know, thinking maybe down in a fire might sort of calm you down. Yeah. Then the farmer said, we need a big pole. Yeah, sure. Gone. But what I'm saying is that, to me, I wouldn't have wanted to go out and be safe. Over. Do you know what I mean? Over being naked. I don't like walking about. We're now on. So what I'm saying is I love. The idea of everyone huddled and there with other firemen. It just good. The cameras, fans long. And it's Carl. Yeah. News report. Naked with still. But was, you have gone out. We're now on. But why do I have to go out with now? I'll just grab a pair of jeans. All right, but you just, you know what? There's a fire, Carl. You know, not everyone looks at men's packets. That's only you, remember. Most of the other firemen wouldn't be going, oh, look at him. But what to see us, Carl. How long did it take? And did the thought of dying in a fire help? After a bit. But the fireman sort of had a go at me. What do you mean? Well, he wasn't happy that I was dawdling. Well, to be fair. But what can you do? Answers on a postcard to the usual address. XFM, care of. Let's just get these rocks. Monkey news. We'll squeeze them in. Life on Mars by David Bowie on XFM. Right, come on, we're running out of time. Blockbusters in. Sorry. Oh, what a giveaway. Oh, no, embarrassing. I've given it away. Straight into monkey news. So, yeah, robbusters. What were the clues? The clues were. The first one was, they're running out of rice, so they've got problems. That was CC. That was China crisis. Right, okay, yeah. If they ran out of rice in China, it would be a crisis. Fair enough. Second one, the Geordie fella doesn't know what he's being charged for, right. That was Bill Weiman. Brilliant. Yeah. And the third one, add two bricks to threat two women, and I didn't. Either of them. That was mister, mister, mister, mister. I let him up. Those were all right, though. That's extraordinary. The winner, Gina, I think. Gina Ferry. Well done, Gina. And the reason I gave it to Gina is because she's included, and this is a wonderful segue, some monkey fact information of her own. She says, apparently, that the group Chumbawamba got their name from one of those monkeys in a room with a typewriter experiments. Someone did it as a joke. And Chumbawumba was a word that was typed out. And that's the group. That's where the group got their name and their lyrics. Absolutely, yeah. Which. Which is good. So let's have official monkey news. Play the jingle. Oh, chimpanzee that monkey news. All right, we've got to be quick. This is something that was sent in to me ages ago, and I don't know why I haven't done it yet, because it's brilliant. We were talking about monkeys typing the Shakespeare theory and all that. Well, this is about a little monkey called Marty, right? Basically, it's in some science lab, right? It's in there. It was wandering about out of its cage, right? The lab fella was busy on the phone or something. Yeah. Right. And typical. It's wandering about. It goes up to a pc that's in the corner. A little computer types down. My name is Marty, right? So the fella got off the phone, saw this on the screen with the monkey sat there, says to his mate, have you done this? Right, hold on, Kyle, let him finish. Before you question. Always let him finish. I don't know what to do. Times against us. Come on. He said, viewed on this, he says, don't walk. He said this on the screen here, saying, my name is Marty, right? He goes, what you talking about? I just haven't an argument with his mate saying, you're lying, you did it. Monkey sat there typing. This isn't a practical joke. My name is Marty, right? And that's the end of the story. I'm not coming in next week. I think we need a week off. I actually think we need a week off. It's doing a web chat or something. You can go online and have a chat, chat with it. The monkey's doing a web chat. I don't know. Right. Do you believe that, Carl? So, no, but do you believe it? Do you believe that monkey could type that and then say, this is not a practical joke, when he saw arguing. Steve? Yeah, well, it's obviously a wind up. It's a joke. It's not even. You haven't even got some of the facts wrong. It's just a wind up. Have you noticed a date, say for the first, it is April the first. You are joking. You're an idiot, Carl. It was sent on April 1, Carl. So you're saying the monkey knows it's April the first, but, you know. Yes. Yeah, I think. I think the monkey has thought, I'll do it on April the first, so that people think that it's a wind up. In actual fact, I am a monkey that can type and read. It's a shame you never went into investigative journalism. You could have brought down, you know, the Watergate scandal. Poor Carl. Well, I was thinking of a song that sums us three up. Yeah. What are we? What are we? What do you think? Would you sum us up. Tricky? Well, young, gifted in black. True enough. Apart from a couple of them. Yeah. We're not gifted. No. And we're not very young. No, I'm certainly not. Should we take a week off? Yeah. Should we maybe just knock it on the head altogether? We'll take a week off and see what happens. Okay, see you next. No, not. Let's not see you next in a couple of weeks. Yeah. Cheers then, Carl.",

Carl, watching a program yesterday, and it was about these japanese snow monkeys, and it was all about how animals learn things that aren't instinctive, particularly sort of primates, because they see other people doing it and they start a culture and they can pinpoint when these monkeys, when one monkey first went down and got in the hot water springs and stayed there because it was hot and the others copied them, and now it's a, it's part of almost a culture, you know, that won't be handed on because not distinctive, but has to be learned each time. And, you know, and they, they groom. That's normal, like other monkeys, right? But they're really intelligent. And obviously the reason they groom other people, other monkeys, is because they eat the mites. But also the monkeys have learned, they like being groomed. Okay? So they showed this one monkey, it went to a deer, okay? And it was grooming this deer to get its mite off it, right? But then it didn't eat it. It held in its hand. It went over to a monkey, put the mite on itself to show the monkey had a mite and got a free grooming.",

I thought, oh, God, if I go around and have a bath straight after, then I have something to eat, I go, well, I got. Sometimes there's chicken legs and they are greasy. So one day I thought, hold on, I'll go to the bath with the chicken legs, I'll eat them in the bath. And it's brilliant. So I'm sitting in the bath, I eat the chicken egg, it's really greasy, right? I just throw it in the bin, go under the water, come up, I'm clean, I've eaten, I'm clean. I get dressed, I go out and meet Johnny, I've lined my stomach. And the good thing about that is that when I come home after beers and I'm eating the chicken, I go, there's only bread left. I just wipe it around the bath. I got a lovely bread and dripping sandwich. That's not true, that bit. But I do. I do eat in the bath.
