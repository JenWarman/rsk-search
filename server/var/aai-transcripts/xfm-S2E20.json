I can't believe our luck. All right, Carl. Yeah. So what are we doing today then? Producer. Right. I always laugh instinctively when I hear Carl's name and that word. Yes. Right. Well, why is that? Because it is. I had to come up with some new features again for this new year. Okay, I'm excited. What have you come up with? We are the backbone of this show. Yeah, we're gonna, we're tell, we're telling. We've come up with some pretty. What's yours first? Right. Go on. Right. Well, rock busters, that's old. That's not a new feature. Yeah, but we'll keep it. Right. So you're just keeping an old feature. Okay. Okay. Now it's an old favorite. I'm sure there's a lot going few. I was worried that he'd lose rockbusters. Rick. I'll just come up with a new idea. Why don't we just play some records that we like? There's a new idea for 2003. Yeah. Oh, you know what? We can't, Steve, because the library's out of order. Oh yeah, the record label. We can't get in there. We're not allowed to get in there. We had to scrounge up from capital gold. So anyway, gone. So we got rockbusters. What are they doing with the library? They forgetting some records in that we want to play. Is that their new idea? I know. Let's get some records in the Gina G. Yeah. Yeah. Fall on blondes. Goodbye. Give that to foxy. Go on. Sorry, Carl. We'll do. We started. Do we need them in 2002? Do we need them? Do we need them? Yeah, we'll continue that. Got a new one up. Yeah, explain that later. Yeah, yeah. And then the new stuff comes in. Oh, right. As always, I like to sort of get words and tweak them and stuff. Sure. Yeah. So I was thinking of either doing something. There's a lot of weird rituals and. They love weird rituals. Yeah, there's weird stuff going on around the world. There is. Yeah. I was gonna tweak that to Rick tools. Okay. Again, start with the title, the pun first, then working out what it is. And that's all my stuff. Right. So it's. It's specifically just stuff that goes on. Like Rick. Jules, there was most of the weird. Stuff I've heard about happened to you in Manchester in your early years. Well, in India, apparently it's good to have a flat head. So the. Again, just flirting, just bordering on the racist. But never really gets there. Always. Well, because there's no. There's no intention, there's no hate. There's no hate. It's just club. Exactly. It's stupidity. Yeah, go on. What do you mean, it's good to have a flat? What do you mean it's good to have a flat in India? We'll talk about it later. Brilliant. So if you've hooked a few people, you've hooked a few in. Go on. All right, so I'll have that way. So essentially, like, educating Ricky only is specifically about rituals. Is that. Is that strictly speaking what it is? Okay, so. But then again, you could say radio is all the same because it's people talking. Okay, cop. Brilliant. Come back. Yeah, really not all talking nonsense, though. Well, so that's where we're different. Go on. Also, right. I like teaching you stuff. Yeah. And you've done well. So what I'm. What I'm thinking is rather than just touching on a topic, sort of giving you a few bits of information. See, this is what I'd like to. Because the last thing you taught me I remember was there was a blind girl. She. Her head and she could see. And that's all I got. Yeah. So if you could go into that a little bit more, that would have been educating me. Well, today we're featuring stuff on World War one and two. So that's. That's that little title for all this little thing is. What do you think of that, then? What do you think of that, then? Flight record? Rick, can I just sort of joke? Go on. What's the similarity between Lord of the Rings and this show? They're both rubbish. What's that, man? David Bowie. I for that insane. My favorite David Bowie album. What's yours, Karl? Yeah, that one's good. Brilliant. So, right, we've got rockbusters coming up. Do you want to say what we've got to give away there? Not really, Rick. Is it really bad? Well, what's the film? What's the featured film? The featured film's not bad, I have to say. Actually, you've excelled yourself there again. It's just one of those things where I think, what kind of XFM listener would want this particular goodie bag? I know before Christmas, Carl, you explained that the reason we were giving away. He'S disgusted because he just said, I do a lot of work getting these prizes. And I went no, you didn't. I saw you. He went over to a draw and went, I'll give that one, that one and that one. That's what work you put in. You nicked. You nicked some. There's about twelve Jerry Halliwell videos, one of which we're giving away. It's like you've given it away. Oh, no. Yeah. If you'd like Jerry Halliwell's body yoga DVD, then, you know, that's one of the treats you can win. But it does it like, if you notice, if you remember before Christmas, he said that he was giving away a kind of bumper pack of gifts that you might want to wrap up. But obviously Christmas is past, so I don't know really what your excuse is this year. You eat a lot over Christmas, don't you? Get a bit farther. Fair point. Yeah. So, yeah, Jerry body yoga is one of them. The recent on DVD, the recent series of weeders own pet. Could you give me that reaction again? Well, no, just don't just give me that reaction again. Yeah. Brilliant. And actually, I have to say this. This isn't bad at all. This is the very best of the stone roses, where you can't knock that. You can't knock that. I'll tell you what, we should play elephant stone at some point. Yeah. Madness. I think this is actually tunes from them and not from the musical. Although is that tied into. He went to see that musical. Really? Yeah. New Year's, you know, it's like on New Year's Day, there's nothing to do. Sure. So you don't see some people doing madness songs. I took Susan out for a walk. Right, yeah. Went round Covent Garden, right past the place where it was on the stage. Door was open. You stuck in madness are all right. And because when you think about it, madness songs are quite sort of musical anyway, aren't they? So you can't. They're quite musical, you know. I mean. The brown blur. The musical would be good, wouldn't it? Blur. The music would be excellent. Yeah. You bought tickets there and then and just went in. They're not selling, are they? It was fair. It's fairly quiet because we only paid the lower price and we got upgraded for free. Nice. So you enjoyed it. And would anyone like to come on stage with us? Yeah, the little bald fella. Yeah, go on, I'll give you a go. And what home are you from? Where you. What are you doing tomorrow? Well, I'm going. No, you're coming here tomorrow. Come here tomorrow. Is he not doing well? That's as disappointing. I don't know. I mean, it was New Year's Day, so maybe that's why it was quiet. Okay, well, if anyone hasn't seen this. Or didn't receive it for Christmas, said, all is quiet on New Year's Day. Carl. Also, we've got to give away minority report by. I like that with Tom Cruise, which is on vhs, a good rit, roaring sort of film. Not bad. That's probably the best thing we're giving away. But as I say, we can always leave somewhere. If you don't, I'm arresting you for the future murder of Sarah Marks. Yeah, brilliant. That's the sort of excitement and drama you'll be getting in it. It's not tasty there. I did. I got that Paul Anderson something to watch over Christmas. So you've actually watched this already? Yeah. All right. I've already wound it. That's probably. It's touched by the great man himself, Carl Pilkington. And it's all right. I'd say it's worth. Worth a watch. Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to give us a quick film? Just give it a wipe down there, maybe some tripe on it. Bit unrealistic. Sure. Unrealistic, yeah. Genius. A man who can fight, who finds people, who can see into the future. Whereas our house. That really happened. Yeah. God. Anyway, prizes, giving away. What? What's the competition? We're still doing rockbusters. Oh, wonderful. Do that in like, 15. I need a bit of coldplay first. I do, honestly. Really? Oh, beautiful. Coldplay, the scientist. I think they wrote that about Kyle. Yes, on XFM 104.9. Right. I'm Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkington. Can I just ask how he got on over Christmas? Because the last time I spoke to him, you hadn't bought a present for your girlfriend. I was on tent hooks all Christmas. Well, you changed it after that show. I felt bad, even though I shouldn't have done because. Because you hadn't bought your girlfriend. I said to you, I booked a table, a hotel in Covent Garden, had Christmas dinner there, which was nice, right? It's good food and everything. Didn't feel like enough to me. Well, then I went out and treated some stuff and. No, no, no. The. A couple of days before Christmas, he went, I took Suzanne to that hotel we're going to go to for Christmas dinner. We had tea and cakes and I went, oh, you treated her? He went, no, she paid for it. But I was just showing her what it was gonna be like. That was her extra treat. She paid for it. I love that. Brilliant. Yeah, well, it was a day. It was like 150 quid for a meal for two, which is pretty dear. So I'm not gonna buy a cakes as well. All right, love. Everything you want. You pay for your own pudding. I'm not mental. But. So you did. You treated her to some other stuff. Some bits and bobs. What she bought. She chose them and you paid for them. What, the presents? Yeah. Or you chose them and she paid for them. But, you know, it's all the cats. I got them on the way home that Saturday. Well done. What did you buy? Well, just some bits might be personal, Steve. Well, I don't care. Leave out the personal bits. What? What bits? Just little things. And then yesterday night, a monkey wrench and a new washer for the shower. Yeah. Some recordable CDs that you need for your job. Now, when you gave those prisons to her, did her face light up? Right. I don't want to tell you what they were, right, but she wasn't that impressed. You even know what they are. She told you on Christmas day. Hold on, wait a minute. But it doesn't matter what they are. It does matter what they are. It does. Carl. It's you, mate. Of course it doesn't matter. Oh, God. Have you just remembered? Yeah, but don't need. I've got to tell him. Carl, I really. I really want your permission, because I don't want to be a. You know. I know it's not. But we know it's not that embarrassing. It's really quite sweet. Yeah. But in a way, right, the way I look at it is, right, Christmas, even when I was a little kid, right, he's not. Please let me tell him, Carl. Well, let me just tell you first. Let me tell you why I didn't go all out on the old present front. Justify yourself. Right? First of all, I've covered it up since then anyway, right, with that present. Because I bought some shoes yesterday. And she did say, I'll give you the money for them, but when I get home, I said, it's all right. I said, you can have them. Not only did I buy her some food on Christmas day, I got shoes. She's probably at a time. Right, bed down, see me later. Yeah, but what I'm saying is. Fed and clothed, yeah? Did you comb her hair? She's done well this year, right? So the thing is, she's done well this year. It's like you're a single parent living on a councillor's date with a smack problem. And you still managed to buy. When I was a kid, it wasn't about what you got. I remember one year when I was. About eight, it's gonna make me cry, isn't it, this? No, it's not. I'm just saying the way it is. Right. I woke up at about four in the morning and I was like, oh, what? Forgot? And I couldn't sleep. Or was that on edge? It's the excitement of Christmas, isn't it? It's like, oh, what's wrapped up? I need to know. And it's the fact that people are saying, no, you won't know until tomorrow annoys you and winds you up. Okay, so I got up at four in the morning, open me presents and then went, right, I know now, went back to bed, had a great sleep. Yes. Right. So it's nothing to do with the excitement of what you get. It's the excitement and not knowing what you've got. And then what happened when you got up to go down with. Hang on. So what you're saying to me is that you could wrap up a brick because the thrill of Christmas is in hoping and it's being excited about what it is, not the actual gift itself. Yeah. Is that, is that what you did? Did you get a brick? No. Let me tell you now what you got. He got her present, right? And she said, church came. I said, yeah, he got me. It was. It was an industrial sized packet of condoms. It was a joke gift. No, it wasn't a joke. It wasn't even a joke. I went home that Saturday after year pass boots thought. Matt, something here. They're on like some value, right? You passed them. Well, they used. You passed all the other stuff past. The lovely vanity cases. Yeah, yeah, the foot spas. Yeah. Hold on, hold on, hold on. How much of these love for hundred? 4.99. Yeah. Do I get them reduced if I buy in bulk? So how many did you buy? What was it? I don't know, probably about hundred. Right. Okay. And is she allowed to use those with anyone? Did you wrap them? Can she just go out? Well, you don't need to write. They're already wrapped, aren't they? Oh, and then what did she say? You're worse than my father. That's genius. Made famous, of course, by Jimi Hendrix. That's all along the watchtower as originally. Done by Mister Bob Dylan on XFM 104.9. So Carl, just, just take us through the moment where you gave this gift. Right? You thought. All right, Andrew, condoms. Brilliant. Okay. Did you wrap it up? I don't know if it was under. Probably 80. Right, okay. Yeah. You don't go mad. Here, wrap them up. I'm just. I, you know, I'm just resting easy, knowing that he's not trying to breed. Yeah. So I got them. I got her grease on DVD. She's always watching that. Yeah, yeah. So just think of when her mum said, what a car. Get you some condoms and grease. I was just. I'm glad he said on DVD. Yeah. She was surprised anyway, right, because. Yeah, I bet she was. She was thinking, like, jewelry. That showed her. That. Surprised you, hasn't it? All right, so hang on, wait a minute. You thought it was a holiday, didn't you? Yeah. Look at your face. You don't know me at all. So, hang on. So did you give these on Christmas Day? Right? What happened is she got in from work that Saturday, right? And I said, look under the knack. Her door. At least it's Christmas. At least. I'm gonna get a little riff. I said, look, you got some stuff under the tree. So did you give her a sugar lamp? Right. She was really chuffed with that, but she said she was a bit puzzled because I didn't know he had any wrapping paper. Right. So I ended up using wallpaper. You didn't take it off the wall, though, you had some. No, it was some leftover. Right. So she said, why have you used wallpaper? I said, well, I didn't have any paper and you were getting in in a bit and I wanted you to have a surprise. So she said, can I have a feel of them? I said, the presents? She thought, right, I've got the right thing. Yeah. Right. And then Christmas day, I said, no, don't get carried away. It's nothing really good, you know. We said we weren't going to buy each other much, so there you go. Open them. Yeah, go on. Can I just ask, had you received your present from her yet? Yeah. So what had you received? What do they have? Had some shoes. Nice. Right. Getaway game for PlayStation. Nice. I'm just tightening up the value of those. Let's just also think about how much fun and pleasure you get from them. Yeah? Although, of course, condoms. I can see the appeal. I also add to that bit. 150 quid for a meal. If you're gonna start totting up 150 quid for a meal. I bought some shoes. 72 quid. Yeah. That was after the event. Then it doesn't matter. All right, so you've received these, dare I say it, thoughtful and nice gifts you handed over. The box of condoms. They were wrapped up. She unwrapped them. Go on, take us through it. Walk us through it. Well, it's not. It's not something you play with on Christmas morning. But when she. What did we say? Well, I wrapped him twice as well, so she thought it was something really good. Extra protection. Right. So she thought it was something really good. And then. So the disappointment would be double. Yeah, go on. Yeah. Then she just opened it and went, oh, yeah, what's on the telly? And that's ungrateful. What an ungrateful woman. That is fancy. Fancy not wanting. I told her, a box of economy condoms from boots. I said to her about the thing about, you know, it's all about the surprise and that in it. Yeah. You explained that to her? Yeah. Well, after she'd unwrapped it. Yeah. She was all right about it. Yeah. She understood Rick. You know, I suggested to him that he buy his girlfriend a gift. I'm worried I've done more damage to the relationship by suggesting that than if he had just forgotten. Next time you've got a go shopping for yourself, Steve. I think I might do. You've better get shopping for yourself. I'm glad it's all over, though. It's mental. Yeah. It annoys me. The whole thing annoys me. And she knows that as well. Yeah. She should know what? She still insists on having Christmas once a year. Well. Well, you know. No, but anyway, what did you get? I can't think what you. What you bring to the relationship, Carl. I don't know what it is she's getting from you in this relationship. It's like she's doing all, you know. 80 times. Oh, God, Carl, I love it. You're brilliant. I know what she's getting. He's the. He's the. He's the what, though? He's not thoughtful. No, he. No, but he's thoughtful. He's the best he can do with the brain he's got. Do you know what I mean? Right. He's doing his best. He's absolutely doing his best. There's no. He's working at the limits of his power. Do you know what I mean, though? He's done as well as he can with what he was given, and that's admirable. I think he's done better than you'd expect. I bet his teachers didn't even think he'd get this far. Do you know what I mean? What? Find a girl. No. Yeah, a job. A girl. Do you know what I mean? Clothe himself. He's done really well. What do you think, Karl? You think you've done well? I think I've done all right compared to someone who mates. What are they doing now? Probably not that much. Misses Matthew said I won't be an eye flyer. I think I'm doing all right. Yeah. I mean, I have a holiday every year. Got somewhere to live? Yeah. Got a new flat, haven't you? Yeah. So. So where are they, then? The condoms, are they. Did she show them to her family and friends? Take them into work? Look. What, Carl. I'm surprised she told Ricky. Actually, I was a bit disappointed in that. Yeah, because I didn't go shouting. Well, she was so excited, Carl. Clearly. She's just so pleased and prayed. All right, play record. We've come back to it. No, that's it now. A new day. Another morning after leaning back on my chair in a greasy spoon street. Don't mug yourself. XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant. Karl Pilkington. A regular Santa Claus. Oh, dear. So, rockbusters. Rockbusters. First one of the year. Do you want to explain it? Okay, so we've got some new listeners. You never know. Chance to win some stuff. I give you like a cryptic clue and some initials and it sort of makes up a band. So an easy one that we did at the start was an exploding pet. AK, atomic kitten. That's how it works. So there's three of them. It's email only. Email in Ricky. JFN dot co dot UK and you win all that stuff Steve was talking about. Right. 1St, 142 pound for a torch. 42 pound for a torch. That's a bit pricey. That's d. That's d. Yeah. Just give us down. So 42 pound for a torch. That's a bit pricey in it. Digging up his growth. Oh, that's Steve. The second one. He'll fit some chocolate to your feet. Say that again. He'll fit some chocolate to your feet. Is that. He will fit some chocolate to your feet. He'll. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He'll fit some chocolate to your feet. And the initial there is a. That's a. Yeah. And the third and final one. Do you think your kid will get that strawberry for me? Do you think? Say it again. Do you think? You think your kid will get that strawberry for me? That's WP. Right. Now I just better warn people. You really got to get into the mindset of carrier. These are not real cryptic clues. These are not cryptic clues that you do in the Guardian or the Times crossword. There's usually something wrong with them. It is usually. What's the word? Completely change the word in order to make it fit often. So just be careful, don't be surprised. Exactly. Okay. Do you want to give us them again very quickly? All right. 1st. 142 quid for a torch. That's. That's a bit pricey, isn't it? That's d. Second one. He'll fit some chocolate to your feet. I can't think of anything. I can't think. That's a. And do you think. Do you think your kid will get that? Strawberry for me? WP. Right, so, Ricky Gervais, fm dot co dot uk. Some great prizes to be won. Richard Ashcroft, science of silence. Steve, if there was a record of the week, that would be a record of the week. You're a big fan. I know, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. Let's make it record of the week. Yeah, that's. That's. That's record of the week. Richard Ashcroft, science of silence. Brilliant. No one gives us anything anyway. Are these plug as they come in? We get things like homemade bands that. They've pressed it in their garage. Yeah. You can hear their mum in the background going, what you doing, mom? Recording this. Rex FM 104.9, Wiki, Jamaica. Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. Carl, what have you got for us? I'm just thinking. The irony is we're the only people on this station, I think, who play their own records, aren't we? I know there's loads of people who do rubbish. Sean Kennedy plays what he wants. 03:00 in the morning. No one's asked zoe on drive. She plays some stuff. What do you mean? What does he play? Fat boy Slim. Properly. It's another remix, you know. I won't say who is by. Christian plays some of his own, does he? Yeah. So, yeah, they're probably novelty songs, aren't they, by you? Right, listen. Right, yeah. New year and all that. He's great. Any, really. We're getting some good stuff coming in. I have to say I'm amazed. Every answer I've had so far has been correct. Listen to the clues. I've got no idea. And I know you call, I spend. Time with you xfm listeners. Of course they're the same as Carl. Of course they've got the same mindset. Yeah, yeah. Oh, what did you do for new year, instantly? Well, I met. Cocked it up a bit. Joking. You're joking. You're joking, mate. Go on. I went and booked the wrong day. Booked a table at a restaurant that was shut. What? I booked a down table at a restaurant, and the one that I called, it wasn't the one. The call had been diverted. So Suzanne said, call them up and see what they're serving. Right? Because I forgot to do that when I booked the table. That's great, because the thing is, right, it's a restaurant in Covent Garden, but they got one in Victoria. But when they answered and they said, no, no, no, Victoria, I thought that was the person who was answering the phone. Do you know how some people say the name? Right? So then when I called them up. And said, you thought he sounded a bit funny, right? So I'm confused, Carl, but probably not. More than you would have been. It was a branch of a restaurant away. So he phoned it up. There's one in Covent Garden. They answered the restaurant. No, no, they aren't. They said, no, no, no, Victoria, why. Can'T we take the restaurant? I don't know why. It's not libelous. Are we scared that, like, are you scared people are going to sort of see you in there because it's your regular haunt? No, it's just that, you know, you gotta pay for stuff on you, right. I mean it. Okay. Anyway, so you've got before new year, but it's not. So did you go all the way to the restaurant to find out that it was closed? No, no. What happened is a close up. The name of the restaurant again, right? The restaurant's called Christopher's. They've got one in Covent Garden. I've got one in Victoria, phoned up. He went to book. He's a lovely restaurant. I've been there often. I recommend it to him. He phones up so it can have a table for new. He said, no problem, sir. Right? And then I said, oh, you better call up, see if they. See if they've got any haddock on the menu. And he went, hello? And they went, hello, Christopher's. Victoria went, Victoria? Yeah. He went, oh, no, that's it. So then I just said, no, forget it. I'm not going all the way over there. So cancelled it. Right? So when I called up, Suzanne said, look, I made an error. The place we were going to is shut. Was she surprised again? No. So we're not going. So she said, oh, try some other places. And I did. They were all booked up. Right. I was fed up. Anyway. I ate new year. It's always like this, isn't it? So you know the common factor in all these stories? You hate Christmas, you hate birthday. It is you. Yeah. So I said, I'll sort something out. So I went to Tesco. Leave it with me. Went to Tesco's, boots were shut. Got a lovely plate of condom. Did you just stay in and play with her birthday? Blowing them up. Looks. I've done some balloons was, I think we did stay in. And I watched, uh, that thing that, you know, under greatest moments, which was annoying me. Did you see, um, there was a nudist on it. You know, I feel about them. Yeah. Man with two knobs. There was a man with two knobs on it and a nudist who just like wanders about the house. But it said, he said, and when he visits people, I was thinking, oh, go, let's invisite. I go, but you must go there with trousers on and go, hello, love. To see you go. Just pop all these off. Well, not really, no. And I'll tell you what, what annoyed me the most. They had a white sofa. If you were a nudist, you'd get, you get a darker one. Right. So anyway, right? So we ended up watching that. That annoyed me. And then I was tired by about eleven and I said, oh, let's go to bed. And she said, you can't. And that annoys me, the fact that because it's new year, you got to stay up. And it's like, why can't we just, you should bring it forward. So in case you want to. Quarter ten. Quarter ten. Well, you stay up and it's like my eyes were dead heavy and I was like, I want to go to sleep. So just stay up. And then it's midnight and you go up in your ear, then you go to bed. Yeah, well, not everyone, Carl. Some people have a little party. So. Yeah. Are you 86 years old? Do you ever enjoy. You never seem to have any fun, Carl. This is what disappoints. This is what worries me. I feel like you're gonna die. You're here. You're here. Karl with us two, we've got three, as I was just saying to Steve, three of the greatest comedy minds ever in one room. And Steve pointed out, since the goodies. True. Do you know? I mean, it should be party central. Yeah. So anyway, right, so this is when I spent time thinking of new ideas. Right? So that's when I came up with. What did I come up with? Rituals. Yeah. This is about. It's good to have a platte in India. Either just runs. Yeah, it's good to have a flat head in India. Is that it? Well, what they do is they put wood around your head and sort of clamp it. And the flatter head you've got, apparently the more attractive in some part of India. Can't remember. So that's like a. That's a rich. I don't know where to start with this. No, we'll leave it. Leave it. We'll be doing that while we've done it. That's the first one was. Also. We've also got. Do we need them? Which we carried on from last year, which is finding out, you know, what animals we need in the world, which ones we can get rid of. I'm talking to experts and that. Finding that out. We're doing rockbusters. That's underway. We're getting emails in and war, do you think of that then? War, do you think of that then? Of course. I love this, that he treats his show like it's a checklist for what he's got to pack for holiday. I mean, it just goes sun cream. Yeah, it's all right, it's done. Look at his face. No, but I try and come up with stuff that people will remember and go, that's interesting. I'll tell my mates that in the pub. Another one I'm thinking of doing. Do you know the film around the world in 80 days? Around the world in 80, gervaise. And what I do, I give you like, little things, like little bits of information about countries so that if you go, you'd go, like, don't want to go there. That's just telling the saying, I apologize. I can't think of the pc word for it, but I think car was slightly retarded. Yes. I was just gonna think. I was just thinking the same. Yeah, yeah, we can do about that. Just play a record. Just keep the. Registered as a charity. I think so. Bally drawn boy born again on XFM 104.9. I'm just. Sorry. I was just looking to see if that's a new single. It looks like it probably is, if that's of interest to you. It's a new one. Yeah. So. Well, first of our regular features with Carl, we've got rockbusters that's rolling. There's people coming in. They're getting them right. I don't. I don't understand. As ever, Rick. You'll be. You'll be amazed and confounded. So I don't know the answer and I haven't looked at the answers. I just like that moment. It's like when you go down Christmas and you excited about present and it's like some condoms. Well, I love that. That, yeah. I don't know how he's going to top that next year. I don't know how he's going to top that. All I can think of is some corn plasters. Right, love. The batteries are included. Got you a pumice stone right now, do we need them? Do we need them? It's something we started a few weeks ago. Always talking about animals and insects and that, and it's like, you know, if you took an animal out of the world, would we have problems? Would it make any difference? Yeah. Would it make me different? We did jellyfish last time, didn't we? Yeah. Sorted that out. The woman said, we've got to keep them. We do need them because turtles eat them. Yeah. So I've moved on. Octopus, do we need the octopus? Yeah, let's find out. I'm working through a load of animals, right, that I'm finding out whether we need them or not, right. Because, like, jellyfish, to me, I'm a bit puzzled by him. I don't really know why we need jellyfish. And I spoke to some experts. Eat them. What? Turtles eat them. Yeah, I know, but do we need turtles? Do you know? I mean, it goes on and on. Doesn't it need humans? Well, you know, I mean, I might get to that bit, but I need to sort out the animals first. I've got a lot on. So the thing is, I've left the jellyfish. We know we need them. Right, so, octopus. Yeah. Right. I know. They're pretty brainy. Incredibly brainy. A story that I heard. I don't know if it's true, but there was some science lab somewhere, right, yeah. Where they had some octopus in it and they had some crabs. Yeah. And at night, the octopus was, like, getting a bit bored on its own in the dark and that. And they sort of come alive in the dark, don't they? Yeah, they like the dark. Yeah. And the octopus had, like, had its eye on the crabs. And at night when it's dark, it was getting out of its little cage, crawling along the floor, getting in the crabs cage, getting them out and eating them. I don't doubt it. We put jam jars with the lids on, with crabs in, and they'll open the jam jar and. You're joking. Yeah. Even I sometimes struggle with them. Yeah. You don't do it really, really tight, but. All right, so they're not that clever, then. Well, they would, if they were strong enough, they'd open it, but just not that strong. Oh, that's mad. Right. I also know that if they get hungry, they eat their own legs. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The death. I don't know. I don't really know. Yeah. They don't live very long. They can squash themselves into small jugs. Oh, yeah. They can go in a demijohn through the narrow neck and that. Why do they need to do that? Because they're the sort of crevices and holes that the hunting for crabs and things through. So would they be better if they were smaller? Do you know what I mean? I don't know. I really don't know. Yeah. Box office, then. If. If Noah said to you, you know, we're having a clear out. Yeah. We've got too many animals to look after and that. In the sea, taking up too much room. Right. Do we need them? I think there's other less useful things in the sea than octopus. Limpets, they could go. Limpets, yeah. They just sit on a rock and do nothing for 50 years. But they're not getting in the way, then. How big are they? Not very big. Yeah. You see, I might come round to them, but I never think. Oh, you know, I'm sick of seeing these limpets. Whereas octopus, you know, crawling about, opening jam jars and that. You'd never see them, though. They're really rare. If we get two or three caught a year, it's a. You know, it's quite amazing. Do we need them? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we'll just have to keep them, then. I love that. Carl can confuse the scientists. Yeah. Yeah. Because all systems of logic break down. I know. Even the scientist was going, well, get rid of them pits. Yeah. I think his name was Chris. And where was he from? In a place called Mega Liszti, where I went one year and he's. Hey, he's a scientist, is he? Think he's got a fish shop or something like that. He's got a fish. No. Aquarium type place. All right, so a fish shop. A winkle store. He's got a winkle store, pool, arbor. Yeah. That's an expert. Oh, dear. What's. What have you learned from that, then? Well, we don't know whether they're deaf or not because the scientist, the bloke within the chip shop, couldn't confirm it. They eat their own legs. Look at that. They eat their own legs? Eat their own legs if they get hungry. Right. And they grow back, don't they? I think so, yeah. If you eat one, they'll grow back. Yeah. And. Yeah, you can put them in. In little jars and that. If you wanted to. Yeah, it's just a bit weird and it's like. No, but, you know, like, you know, people have a go about being cruel to animals and that. But what he was saying there is. Right, what they've watched an octopus do, they've got hold of a crab, right? So that will be being stressed out because it's out of the water. They've then stressed it out even more by putting it in a jar, which they didn't like. And then an octopus is crawling about on the jar. The crab knows that the octopus wants to eat it, so then it's having more frets. Yeah, because of that. And then they let the octopus eat it. Yeah, I think that's pretty. Do we need crabs? Do them next week. Yeah. Well, I want to sort out snails first. What's your pitch with snails? What do you know about snails? I know that bats eat them. They can sleep for 13 years. Right? Can you believe that? They said to me, snails can sleep for 13 years. And I went, right. He went, thing is, though, if it was a scientist and he was, you know, he was looking at it and he put it in a quiet place, it might well doze off. He said, it wouldn't be the same if it lived on the streets. And then we went on to a whole thing about homeless. He wants to do a game show with celebrities being homeless for a week. What do you think? Actually, I've got to say, that's not bad. It's not bad, is it? No. Do you know how, like, Lenny Henry went to the jungle? Yep. Right. And you've got. You've got. Who else did it? Made slippers out of a bra. Right. So I'm thinking, like, get a celebrity and say to him, no, just because. I'll tell you why. Right, I'll tell you why. All this came about when I was walking back from that Christmas meal that I bought my girlfriend for 150 quid. Lest we forget, I was walking down Mortimer street and there was an armless fella there and it was like, oh, you know, it's really, really bad. But the weird thing is it was about, I don't know, probably about 08:00, about nine, right. And he was asleep and I just thought, do all those people ever think, do you know, I'll have an early one tonight. Right. That's. That's what got me thinking. It's a bit weird, the whole lifestyle of it. What if it's a bit weird that he's sleeping not in a home, but on the street? No, it's just that if I. Interesting. If I was interested, I'd probably stay up quite late because it's not nice. What are you talking about? Just being homeless isn't a good thing, is it? No. People forget how bad it is. Yeah, right. But surely sleeping gets you out of reality. They sleep because they're tired. They can't sleep very well, so they need all the sleep they can get. Sleeping's nice if you've got a nice big bed. What, you think they can go? I'll stay up, I'll go to bed at two, I'll go straight to sleep and I'll pop up at eight when the alarm clock goes off. Well, it's just what I was thinking, right. So I was thinking how bad it is and it's, you know, especially this time of the year, you know. Yeah, it's terrible. It's that it's the worst thing. And to sort of give it some publicity and get a bit of help behind it, get celebrities. Someone like Phil Mitchell, maybe. Yeah. Off eastenders. Yeah. Who's a big fellow, you can look after himself, put him in a shop doorway, have some cameras set far away in a building or something. Yeah. They can film him and it's up to him how he raises money for food, to eat. He could sign autographs. Well, they wouldn't know him, though, would they? Because you never get. What's her name? Gail Porter. Yeah. Gabby Roslyn, right? Yeah. Narinder from big Brother. Yeah. I got a game show. Let's. Dennis. I reckon short here called on the game and what happens is you get the Riddler. Sugarcane by Sonic youth on XFM 104.9. Ricky Ray, Steve Merchant, Karl Pilkington. Go on, Kyle. What's next? Are you gonna do your war feature? War? What is it called? War. Do you think of that then? You do that now. I just. It annoys me a bit. Right, because we said before Christmas that we come back with new stuff. Yeah. Gave you a title to work on that, Rick. Ridiculous. Right. You came in today, I said, have you sorted it out? You say, no, Steve, you're having a go at me for getting. Wanting to get music out the library for you. Yeah. You haven't got any new ideas? Sure, but you're dissing mine. I'm not dissing yours. Well, I'm a massive fan of them. Good vibe off you. That's very harsh. I just asked you when were we gonna have war. Do you think of that? I'm a big fan. I'm excited. Well, it's not that good. To be honest with you. Well, I disagree. It sounds brilliant. Right, well, it's. It's a bit of a tweak of educating Ricky. Just some information on wars. Yeah. World War two. World War two. All right. The world champion chess player. He helped someone out. It's the detail I like, you know, it's nearly a history program, isn't it? I was watching those repeats of the world at war. Yeah, they were on in the mornings, you know, incredibly. Did you like. Nothing on car. Did you write a lot of that David Sharma series? He was able to use his skills that he has to play chess, because apparently chess is all about probabilities of, like, where, you know, where a piece will be put right? And they got him in and they said, can you help us out? He said, yeah. And he said, right, where should we. Like. Hitler has just moved his queen. He sent in a bishop that ran diagonally through the troops, knocking him over. Sorry, wait a minute, Carl. So they got a chest. Sorry. That's it? Well, yeah, it's just like, oh, what do you think? Again, that's not a story. But it angers me that he says that I'm down on the ideas when that. I mean, that's beginning to shape up. It's quite interesting. I thought you were going to tell me which battle or which event was you. There's not a battle, but which bit of you. World War two, like the middle bit. Six years worth. Yeah, well, probably about a bit. Guessing. Guessing. Well, all right, yeah, there is a bit of guesswork, but it doesn't matter. That could have been an interesting thing if you told me it had an. Impact on the normal things. Do you go, bloke wants help chess. Oh, use that and run away from the computer. I run out of the bookshop. I read the first line where I get enough information. I just think, what do you mean. You read the first line where you get enough information? Imagine if you are someone's defense lawyer and he was like, he's on death row. I don't think he did it. Yeah, I read the first line. Didn't read the file. Tell in Texas. Right, go on. It's a. No, it's enough, it's enough. It's enough. It's enough. Yeah. Ages on deciding where to go. She's like, you know, I don't know. What he's saying now. I don't know what. I don't know what you're talking about, actually. Don't play chess. You take ages to make the move. So I'm just thinking there's probably a quick away. What then finding where a boat is. Then I getting a chess player. I don't know. I don't know what you mean. Now. They should have got an expert belt ships player. Yeah, yeah. What? No, no, I'm not being funny, but what is that? What are you telling me? There's someone who's really good at risk? Yeah, cluedo. Yeah, that's enough. That is it. Well, they use expert kudo players but the police. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If ever there's a murder in a country house, do you think they use. That old chinese fella on the front of mastermind? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. For logic problems, the enigma code was broken by top mastermind players and a. Guy who's had a couple of reins of Yahtzee. In second fact about the war, for. Engineering, they use a lot of Jenga players. Absolutely. Will the building collapse? I don't know. Let's pull this. Let's see what you doing. If they want to identify spies, bring me the champion of guess who? Was it one with glasses. No. The war fact saying it's rubbish. But look, you love that. Yeah. The first bomb that was dropped on Berlin. Yeah. It didn't kill a person, but killed an elephant. I think that's true. It's true. Right, okay. And the last one, is that all. You know about that? See, that's interesting in it. What's it? But no, it's not. No, because, I mean, listen, most want to go, oh, what was the elephant doing there? Did it land in a zoo? Was it a pet? Was it a lost elephant? Did they aim at the elephant? How did it kill it? Was it his favorite elephant? Did it then have one ball? I mean, these are the things, you know. Why didn't he catch it with his trunk? Did it have an effect on german morale? Yeah, that's elephant discompose. CHEERING BREAKS PAINKiller on XFM Carl's getting a little bit stressed, aren't you? No, I just. I just, you know, gotta keep focus, gotta keep the show good and that. Yeah. You know, and in the new year, the idea was come up with some good snappy stuff. Yeah. And today I just think it's been a mess with you, to be honest. I mean, this is the sort of thing I'd prefer to do after the show as the producer. Yeah. I think it's a discipline problem. Is it because I just put stellar tape on your head? Well, that's a bit to do with it, but just, you know, let's just focus. I didn't put it when there was any hair on your eyebrows. I put it across your forehead. Right. What do you think of that, then? Yeah, we've got one more bit left. Brilliant. One more fact. The French, right? When they were at war. David Sharma, just imagine him just introduced. Which war was this? It was still the world war one or two. Go on. It's 50 50. Go on. What the French did. Everyone needs a code. Everyone needs a code. Yep. A code. When you're. When you're in the office, a Disney song and, you know, to sort of give the go ahead if you want to go into battle and stuff. Okay. So. Go on. Do you. Yeah. So what was the french code for? What sort of say. Right, yeah, go on. But they had more than one on this day. But I don't know what day it is. What am I thinking of? What was the battle? What was the. Okay, so, all right, what. He's genuinely confused that I've asked this question, right? It was. No, no. If you ask me a question, ask me the question correctly. What was that? What was the code for battle during what vowel? World War Two. No, that's not a battle. That's a war. Yeah. It wasn't a war. Yeah. I don't know what to do. He confuses people. All right, okay. What was it called? What was the. Yeah. John's got a mustache. That was. Was a code that the French use. You know, like. I mean, I just think it's a bit daft. Right. Because you could come up with that by mistake. Yeah. Two french blokes talking in the trenches, and they see. They see a major walk past, they go, look, John's got a mustache. And they all go, no, I was just talking. What are you talking about? Well, the way. I don't think that's a good code. I'm not. I don't believe it is the code. No, it is. Seriously, I want. Would it have been said in French? Yeah. Okay. Guessing. Guessing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What you see? I can't even be bothered. What are you saying, Carl? Because he's not a very good code. Do you know, like, we've talked in the past about, you know, things you don't see? And I said, an old man eating a twix. Yeah. To use that. That wouldn't. That's safe because no one is ever gonna see a man having an old. You know, an old man having a twix. What do you mean? Well, use that as a code. Don't use a saying, John's got a mustache. That could crop up. Looks like the walls kicked off. Why did that happen? Well, said John had a mustache. Oh, two french folks would never be saying, john's got a moustache. Why would they? Because back then they were fashionable. He nearly makes sense, doesn't he? I assume it would have been Jean. Yeah. No, probably John. And how would this code have been? I mean, who would have announced it? I read it like that, Steve. That's what was on the Internet. This is a code that was used. John's got. Don't be angry with me. I know, but you're always asking questions. Because I'm interested in history. Yeah. No, it's a genuinely interesting bloke. Khan, we'd like to know. I'd like to film you secretly. You know, like they do. Like nature watch when they put it in, like a. You know what I mean? Badgers sort of thing. And they just watch it. I'd like to see what you do. Pop around and go, I wish I could download the music in your head. Cause it'd be. And you see something weird, you go. And then you read that and you go. And you write it down and that's what comes out. John's got a mustache. Imagine the French, right, for their battle cry, for their battle code, to know it's going ahead. They're going over the top is you never see an old bloke eating a twix. Imagine that. Yeah. But all these things are things that I think in my head, keep them in there. Do you know, like before. Before when I was talking about going out on, you know, Christmas Day, having a meal on the way back, seeing a homeless person? Yeah. And then I think, God, that wouldn't be good. I know. Tv show, you can think of things like that. When I saw the Elmer's fella, then I got talking to Susan about when I had to sleep in my car. What do you mean? Go on. Let's play a record and come back to any. Sleeping in the car. Oh, my God, I can't wait. I was watching last night on cable tv. 1980. Seven's amazing sign of the times. Prince in concert film. It was dynamite. I thought myself, how brilliant he is. It reminded me of the gig I went to see last year. He played this tune. It's from the album parade. Okay. I don't want to discuss whether or not Prince is acceptable on XFM or whether he's a genius. He's a genius. That's the end. That's the end of the discussion. Play the tune he's done about I remember. I'm going to tell you, I was on the way here, you know. Do you remember, John? He's got a mustache now. I can't believe it, lads. No. It'S not on. It was not on. Look at your face. To die. Yeah. No, I believe that. Yeah. Sometimes it snows in April from the lovely prince. Brilliant. From the album parade. He doesn't always have to get up and have a rockabout. He can just sit there at the. I can't argue with that. After the break, Steve. A brand new feature I've just done. That's Rick. Ridiculous. That's Ricky. Dick Lucas. You see, you say Ricky Gervais doesn't put any work into the show. He's just done that. I'm going to tell Carl some amazing facts from the world of science, nature, politics, for a real one is absolutely rickety. Kiddicolas, cat Stevens from Catch Bullet four album sitting. Little interesting fact for the nerds. We got it down to two songs to do this. Intro. Music to the office. It was that one. And handbags and cloud rags. We went for handbags. Interesting. It is a fascinating fact. Except, of course, we want. I still feel we should use that one. Except we couldn't because cat Stevens is. People wouldn't let us, or it was too expensive or something. I don't know. We recorded well, Stuart, I still prefer that one. Yeah. Difficult, difficult decision. Anyway, that's rick ridiculous. Right. Five facts, right. One is totally made up. All right, just do three. Okay. Right. Oh, let's see. What should I do then? There are more carefully planned. There are more moves possible in a game of chess, and there are particles in the universe you can't get any colder than liquid nitrogen. I think it's minus two, seven, three. It's impossible to get cold in that. The honey badger has got skin so loose that if you grabbed it by the neck, it could come away from its skin, turn round and bite you out of its anus. That's ridiculous. Right. Rockbusters, then wrapping it up. It needs some work, that game. But I see it's got a lot of mileage. Then the first. 142 pounds for a torch. That's a bit pricey. Go on. That was D. That was dear light. Wait. I thought delight. And I thought, it doesn't work. I thought, delight doesn't work. Second one. There's no. Wait, wait, wait. Dear light. It doesn't work. It's D light. Second one. No, no, Carl, it doesn't work. Yeah, but if we're gonna continue with this feature you've got to tweak them a bit. Right. People have got it. We've had loads of emails, more than ever. So. Do you know what I mean? Let them decide. If they don't like it, they won't email in, but they're loving it. They've all come from the same institution. He'll fit some chocolate to your feet. That was a. That was Aerosmith. Aerosmith. You've heard of a blacksmith, but a. Smith is just a workman. Doesn't necessarily know you can have anything. You have a locksmith. A Smith doesn't just mean it does shoes. Right. Do you think Aero cobbler would have worked? Unfortunately, there isn't a band called Aero Cobbler. Get ready with a winner. Do you think your kid will get that strawberry for me? That's Wilson Pickett. Will son Pickett. I have to say that I don't know if these guys have won in the past, but they were the first people to email in these. I mean, normally I just give it to anyone but these guys, literally. You've given the clues, Carl. I'm amazed. Everyone seemed to get Aerosmith. Everyone got d lite, everyone got Wilson Pickett. I'm absolutely stunned. I just. I. You know, they deserve it. They deserve the junk prizes. Right? So we'll give it to Jonathan and Louise, who, as I say, may have won in the past, but as I say, they were very, very quick. You've got to be there if you want to win. And they're from Wrexham, so good luck to them. So that's how they enjoy Jerry's yoga diet. Back next week, then. See you later. See ya. Cheers. Cheers.",
