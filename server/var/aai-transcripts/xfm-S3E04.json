It was amazing, wasn't it? See, I'm not a rugby man at all. I never watched rugby. I think the last time, I think, was when we weren't, about twelve years ago, whenever it was. And I got into it last week because I realized we were doing so well. Because I watch England win anything. Yeah. I mean, I don't care what. In fact, I wasn't into war when I was little until I realized we were so bloody good. We are really good at it, you know, it's brilliant. But, um. Oh, yeah. Fantastic. Yeah, it was great. Well, that's the rugby thing over. What next? That's it. That's all I've got. That's all I have today. It does seeming. Sometimes I watch it like, does. It does remind me of when I play rugby because one of them will boot it down the field and it's gonna catch it and booty straight back again. Yeah. Which is essentially how we play. I was made to play rugby, right. And I don't think I'd get rid of the ball so quickly. Yeah. I don't think I ever got tackled or fell over. I think I touched the ball about 20 times in the two years it was compulsory. I was terrified. Same as cricket. I can't. I'm a terrible batsman. I'm all right at bowling. But it seemed like the past time for people I went to school was to injure you. It was funny to see someone Polax. It was funny to see someone get a cricket ball in the head. Absolutely, yeah. You know, I never relaxed into rugby because the first day I was gonna play it, my mum, I swear to God, my mother said, you're playing rugby today. You got the kit and everything. Enjoy it. Be careful. There was a kid in my school who got. Who broke his neck. Yeah. Thanks very much for that. See you like that. So have you just went to school? Actually, one thing. Broken neck. That's. You get better in a couple of days. No. Enjoy the game, though. Yeah, no, it was. It was absolutely. I was just petrified from that day. See, at least american football, you know. Yeah. But anyway, no injuries. Thank God. Thank goodness. So. Well, I tried to try to play, but it's awkward when you've got glasses. I don't know, something. You didn't really play with glasses on. Yeah. I couldn't see anything could. I couldn't see anything. How else was I going to play? Oh, my God. And they. So you're bound to be cautious because inevitably you're a bit more cautious when. You'Ve got glass person on the pitch as well. Yeah. I mean, you, when you're about 14, you were probably six foot anyway, and everyone else was about five two. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you towering above them and you've got pretty cool glasses now you've had a bit of a makeover. It's like Trinity and Suzanne said, first thing to go, the glasses. Sure. Sort them out. Yeah. And presumably you used to have those. No. Mouths sort of buttering much. Is it true you've never been able to mosh? I try to mosh, I. Because I've always watched people stage diving, moshing at concerts. I've always thought that looks like brilliant when they ride above, like they're surfing across someone's land. And I always wanted to do that because I'm a big rock music fan and the only time I did mosh was at Rage against the Machine. I tried to mosh it. Rage against me. I love the idea of a band called Rage against the Machine aimed at a man with glasses. He wrote marsh. Well, it was at the reading festival and I think the lead singer, I forget his name, he went, can I just remind everyone that racism and fascism. Fascism are on the rise in Europe again? Let's not let it happen. What did you do? And we all cheered, obviously. There's one thing that guarantees a cheer. Yeah. Reading festival, it's down with fascists. And what did they do about it? After concert? Pretty much went back and went home and probably, I don't know, they didn't go to Europe then and try. I don't think they got involved politically in Europe. I think they just continued to rage against the machine. Yeah. Largely in America, I think. Sure. I tried to mosh and I got moshing and glasses flew off and I went. I went. I remember, because they were playing away, you know, do what you tell me. I was just going, careful. I've just, like. I've dropped my glasses. Can we just. Loads of kids in hoodie tops just. Going mental and they're all jumping up. So I just. Can we just calm down for a second? Let's not be silly. Yeah, yeah. It was absurd. I had to kind of, you know, scrabble around on the floor and thankfully they were okay and they didn't get broken. So what couldn't you do then? What do you mean? What can I do. What school. Can you not. Can you not see without glasses? I mean, what you're. It's like that. You couldn't do anything, Blair, really. Blur, definitely. God, yeah. It's like being kind of punch drunk or whatever. So, yeah, you can't play sports when, you know, when you've got glasses. But why not contact lenses? Because they're not strong enough. No, I just. It was. Seemed a bit fiddly. Brilliant bit of Lou Reed. So what you want? Yeah, satellite. I love classic. A retro cut flu reed with a little help from David Bowie there in the background. Satellite of love on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steven Merchant and Karl Pilkington. Now, Steve, you know our Carl won't do anything outside his jurisdiction. Yeah, he moans about stuff. He's got one job we've got. We're doing about five things in the week and we just turn up and he's always available. He moans but he goes, oh, lucky you caught me. Right. He's not, he's chatting, he just win. He's one of those people that whinges enough and people think he's overworked. So he got Mondays off, right? He's just one. A winger. Yeah, well, anyway, 2 hours on a Saturday. This is what the phone message he left me Wednesday on my mobile. But just chatting about certain things that are going on at the moment. What he does need to know, old Duncan he mentions is my agent and, you know, you understand a few other things, but this is the sort of message I get from Carl. Right wing. Wednesday. Just getting loads of people calling me all the time about yesterday, DVD signing for BBC London. I don't work there, but I've been dragged into that. I've got a woman on leaving a message from talk pr going on about do you want to go and see pop idol again? Right, saying you and some listeners can go. So I'm sure you'll love that. I've got Jim Benner wanting you to introduce the tin buckets at the Astoria. So can you just like let Duncan know that I'm doing his job whilst he's sat on his ass with his thumb firmly up his arse? Can you let him know that I'm running around like a sorting out for you? Alright, see you later. Do you know what I mean? I know, but that's the kind of phone message he's leaving. But remember who he was before you. But he's even annoyed that he gets a phone call. I remember he got a phone call for you to do a voiceover and didn't pass it on. You missed a voiceover. That was thousands of pounds. Pass it on, though. I told you. She said someone had phoned. Yeah, that's not good enough. But who's that? Well, she didn't say and I didn't ask. Of course she said. She didn't say rubbish. So you didn't take your number down? She switched. She went, oh, can you tell Steve to call me? And you went, yeah, yeah. Well, I just thought you'd know her already. I should have known it was a woman, so I should have known. He's having a go, you see. Unbelievable. I don't know how it's gone back on me. You're the one who was picking on it. Yeah, exactly. I'm saying, I'm defending. Why is he having a go at you? Because he picks on Ricky. Because he knows you are his bread and butter. Seriously. You know what I mean? The only reason he's got Monday's office because you're still doing this show. Yeah, that's why he's scared of you. That's why he's like, he has a go at you on the phone, but he always picks on me because he knows, you know, I'm a pushover, I'm a nice guy. He's scared of you. I can't believe. I don't know how it works. Is that true? If I'm always sorting you out, I look after you, sort you out with tickets. What would you mean, you sort my tickets in lager? What's this? Right? Whenever you want tickets. I don't want to use this as, like, moaning time and that, because I don't like to moan. I'm busy and that. Right, I've sorted you out tickets for gigs. Yeah, right. What somebody doesn't even turn up to. Yeah, we won't even go on about that. Right. Lager sorting out. The Curie complained it was boring. Yeah, it was that big drummer lager that you had and you said, I'll put that in your room for me. Yeah, because I don't want to carry it home. Lazy. So I said, all right, then I'll put it in my room. It goes missing. It gets nicked. Then you have a go at me because it got nicked. Yeah. I get you another one, you make me carry it around town for you for half an hour, then you say, I can't be bothered taking it home. Can you take it back to work for me? Yeah. Yeah. But interestingly, this is like a year ago. So it's still, still pressed on you. Oh, hang on. And I forgot the one when we had an argument over 50 p. Back that you owed me. That was the same day you'd given him about 40 quid worth of lager. But see, this is my problem. This was my point at the time. It's not the 50 p in terms of money is not what's important. The fact that you think you don't have to give me money back because it's only 50 p. That was the point at stake. It's me who makes a decision. Oh, don't worry about the 50 p, not you. It's only 50 p. I'm not going to give it to you. You know what I mean? There's gotta be rules. Otherwise it's chaos. Carl, come on, mate. All right. Kissing makeup. Yeah, we should play that record and come back to this. Cuz I can't believe it started with you slacking him off. Rick. And I've ended up as the monster I know of. Rm yeah. Rem and animal. Animal think that animals would be Rem and their animals. Well, now, just when I'm just thinking, I wonder if there's on a video for animals and the animal on a DVD, an animal CVD. Huh? I'm just this Rem. There just a good link. Rem animal honest DVD would be. I've got, I've got, I've got an animals DVD out. My DVD, my life stand ups out by it, plugging it. It came up in comfort animals from REM. I don't think you should plug your DVD. Well, buy it now. It's a really good stand up DVD. I said, if you're gonna buy anything, I mean, I think I ought to balance this out, really. If you're gonna buy a DVD, you should probably buy the office series, too, because I get money for. That's been on telly. Animals, see, in animals hasn't been on telly. The office has been on telly. It's bored with it. But I don't get any money for the animals. That's what I mean. I get myself got to share the office where it was with you and some of the other actors, whereas I get the whole. The lions share lions. An animal. The lion's share of animals. It's all mine, you see? Hmm. So, I mean, the truth of it is that it's not. I mean, it's your stand up and it's not great. It's a bit. A lot of the observations. No, no, no, no. You're great. Actor. I'm rubbish in the office. One trick ponytai and I look at the camera, bored with that animals whole new side. Yeah, but frankly, you've been doing quid, you've been doing so much publicity on tv that, you know, if people have seen it all, they'll probably seen all the best clips. I mean, there's only a couple of. Decent games really, the dance and you get that on a JPEG. So the great stuff don't buy the office. Some other great stuff in there. No, no, Phoenix Knights is about in the office, so bye. Phoenix nights don't buy the office. Okay. Right, let's get on with it. That's that. You, right, what else is probably most. Of the standard observations on this show. So. Right, what have you got for us? Available in action b? Go on. Oh, well, I'm annoyed. Oh, office. I was walking away from the show last week. I was walking was barracks. We like to look at the records and that records. And I was on my mobile phone, I was chatting away to someone and, uh, what can only be described as a prostitute. Go on. Still on the street, was she a. Woman that gives you sex for money? Yes, that is a prostitute. Yes, that's what I thought. Go on. And as I was walking by, she said, you want to buy sex? No. You sure? I wasn't a market trader giving six plums? No, it was definitely sex for a queen. No, it was definitely a prostitute. Yeah. And what annoyed me about it, what I wanted to pick her up on something, was the fact that I was on my mobile phone. It's like, can you imagine? Who would I. What am I gonna hang up? Sorry, mum, can I call you back? You know, you say you want me to meet more women and, you know. You sent me that 30 quid exactly. Yeah, yeah, sorry, mister Johnson, I'm really excited about the job, can I call you back? I'm just gonna negotiate with a whore. And it was, it was like, it. Was just, you could tell that she was clearly probably desperate for crack or a ladies fix a smack. So she was literally the normal etiquette of prostitution, you know that they hang around, they show some thigh. I've seen this in films, take you out for a meal that sort of gone out of the window and she was just there, desperate, running around the window. Because that's another thing they sometimes do, specialist ones. I was shocked because I've never been propositioned before like that. Really? In London. It's weird, isn't it? Carl, thoughts? I think you'd be sort of approached a lot, because they tend to sort of go for people who look like they haven't got much chance. Sure. And I'm not being mean. No, no, sorry. I'll let you go. In what way aren't you being mean by saying that Steve, Steve knows is a little bit odd looking, I don't think. Well, no, he does. No, but it's not whether what he thinks of his looks, it's what he thinks of you talking about his looks on nobody's. It's like how you were talking before about, you know, your eyes are bad. It's nature's little way of saying, look, nothing to see here, right? When you look in the mirror and that they've gone, look, he hasn't got the looks. Let's make his eyes bad. Right? Yeah. Nothing to see here. That's what I'm saying. Right. Yeah. And it's funny, right, now we're on the topic. Sorry, sorry. Johnny Depp. Hey, listen, I'm gonna, my, my chest is gonna burst at this moment. Whenever we get to this conversation, I always think to myself, Carl, do you know what you look like? I'm gonna burn. Seriously, can I be honest with you? You look like, you know, if you've got, like, a balloon, a hot air balloon, right? Just a little balloon, like a party balloon. If you drew a little face on it, right, and inflated it about halfway, that's what you look like. Right? So play a record. I don't want to get into this now. You've got onto this. Let's just nip it in the bud. Now, I'll tell you something that I wasn't going to tell you because I think. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it, right? It was on the tube, right? Well, I was. Someone told me they were on the tube, right? And it. The tube pulled into a station and one of the women saw the poster that's out at the moment with you and Rick on it, right? So this, this woman apparently goes, oh, look, there's Ricky. Ricky's on the radio, right? And the other woman goes, oh, yeah. Don't you listen to it? So she goes, oh, I didn't, I didn't know he was on the radio. And she goes, oh. Look. He found this bad one. She said, oh, look at that. Look at that person he's with. So she goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She said, that's Steve. She said, I'm kind of, I was sort of aware that he looked odd because Carl mentions it on the radio. Yeah, so it wasn't as much of a blow to me, but I can see how it was a bit of a shock to you. Yeah. So that's what. That's. That's weird, innit? Yeah. And that isn't me sort of telling this one to say anything. That was all happened without anybody else sort of bringing it on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you know? I mean. Yeah. So was it. Sorry? You seem to be relishing this. Was it because the little balloon story that made you. Honestly. See, I want to told you, but if you're gonna start, you know, having a pop. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I can't just sit here and take it. No, no. I mean, all mates. Yeah. Just. Yeah. Well, I mean, I was mistaken for Johnny Vegas. Steve's got a story about that if you want to have a go at me. Someone just thought you were fat with a beard, which is true. Well, don't have a go at me. Because he said, you don't know. You started it. No, I didn't. No, I didn't. You were milking it. I was laughing. You're egging him on. I thought I was. Yeah. But let's not, you know. Oh, it's a good job. You've got lots of good mates like Jonathan Ross you can go and hang out with. Don't need other friends, people who've helped you in your career. He's good looking bloke, isn't he? Jonathan Ross? He's a good looking fella. Player. Out of time by blur luckily, we're not out of time. I've got another hour and 25 to go, so it's not over yet. On XFM 104.9, I'm Ricky Gerbais. With me, Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington. We've had quite a lot of emails, as ever. Ricky, I should just say, because, you know, we're very lazy. Listened to show. We're very lazy people and we rarely reply or read out the emails. But we do. We never read the emails. Absolutely not. So I rely if I haven't replied to them or my mail, Steve opens my mail and reads my emails. So if I haven't played, it's just because he hasn't passed it on to me. Yeah, okay. But I haven't passed on to you because I know you'll never reply. Sure. You know, I'm just cutting out that. But I just want to say thanks for the emails. We do read some of them and we do appreciate the fact we were sending jokes. I appreciate it. I love it. But we don't have to do anything towards it. Sure. We had an email from Jack. He just said he missed the last two weeks shows. Has he missed anything? Not really, no. It's the same stuff. I think Carl. Last week, Carl was having a go at chinese people not aging well. He had a go at the gays and he came up with a ludicrous story about a monkey that was impossible. So I don't think Jack's missed much. Go on. I just had an email from the Pringles people. Are they right? Good, because it's finally started to happen. I hear these stories about people getting given cars and Armani suits and trips abroad and we haven't had. But finally people are starting to, you know, realize what we're doing, our impact on society. And we've got a whole box of pringles sent to us. Not on those little tubes, the proper tubes, the foot long tubes. Yeah. So, you know, and I. You know, what have they said? Well, the Pringles go on back. No, no, they said they like the show. And if you want more pringles, give them a call and I'll send you more pringles. Yeah, I've liked pringles. Yeah. Pringles are. The thing about pringles is they're moorish. Right. But how would I put it? You know the sort of thing. When you open. When I open them, yeah. And by that, I. When I pop. Right. Yeah. I have to eat. Okay, I'm gonna put this. When I pop, I can't stop. What do you mean? I don't. Well, when I pop. When I pop them open, I can't stop eating them. Right. When you pop, you can't stop. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's because of the chemicals. They're good Pringle chemicals. They're not bad chemicals. Lovely chemicals. Yes. I want some more pringles. Yes. Well, it's interesting, actually, you're saying that, like, other people, you know, like Kylie, I imagine, would get given sort of maybe sexy underwear. You got Robbie Williams where he gets d. Armani suits. You get sent the crispy. Yeah. It's nice to be saying I am gone. Talking of pringles, I think Finchley Road tube station on the way in. There's pringles there. Well, I'll tell you a job. I don't like what I would want to be doing. The. The woman. There's a little woman who sits in the little snack stall on Finchley Road. Yeah. And I don't know how to describe it, really. She is surrounded by snacks she can't move for snacks. It's like american beauty, but with. With not dissimilar to that. It's a little hut on the station. And it's like if you go to the seaside, you can put your head through one of those cardboard cutouts and it looks like you're a big fat person. Whatever. You have your photo taken. It's like an equivalent of that. But it's just snacks everywhere. She's got bananas up to her chin. She's got chocolate coming into her eyes. Crisps either side of her. She can't move. She can't do 360 degrees. She's like packed in there. I don't think. I don't know how she gets in there. I think they put her in her first and they put, okay, pour in the bananas. Yeah. They pour in the nuts. She has 2 hours of makeup before they open dressing her in there because I'll ask for something from the fridge. And she cannot turn her head to see. She has to go by feel alone just to feel the fridge and get stuff out and pass it. And often I'll say, that's not what I wanted. But she can. You can't let her off. It's extraordinary. But there's no music playing. She has to sell her way out of it. If it's a slow day, she's stuck there till the next day. Yeah. It's like a world breaking attempt. Yeah. Oh dear. That's Finchley road. So if you're on Finchley road or just want to pop down there, have a look at the snack woman. Because it is. Get refills though. I don't know. It works. I don't know how she goes to the toilet or eats. I don't know what she does. Yeah. But God bless her. That's. So that's one of the jobs you would. Jobs I would not like. I've always worried about working in one of those big photocopying places. Sure. Because it says that constant taste of toner. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's so dry and just. I just imagine going to work with a hangover 8 hours in that sort of. I think it's those jobs where. What's the best that can happen that day? Do you know? In the photocopying shop, what's the best? Well, they probably have interesting things like they, you know, people going to photocopying. Porto mags. Can I have 30 copies of my ass? Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I couldn't make it to the staff part. Yeah. Yeah. But I wonder if I could do that in here. Yeah. Carl, what job wouldn't you want to do? Well, any job. You're a lazy joking, aren't you? I've done loads of stuff, this. I'm quite happy now, doing what I'm doing. Yeah. You look happy. I think I'm happy, yeah. I mean it. Calm down. You on drugs? I'm all right. Are you on that? I'm for them. Yeah, go on. Yeah. Would you be happy for them? We are England for us. Yeah. I mean, we didn't play. I did very little towards it. It was mainly Johnny Wilkinson. I barely contributed. Switching on the tv was about as much as I did. Exactly. And shouting, come on. Talking about jobs and that. Though I was reading the other day about, you know, rubbish jobs that people have had on. I've got time when I work, man. I just get on with it. I'm not squiddly diddly. Fingers in pies. Different jobs. Go on. Do you know iva the terrible? Ivan? He. Yeah, his Russian. Yeah. That was the welsh fella. It was. He was bloody awful. But not as bad as his russian cousin, Ivan. Go on. He had a fella doing some work for him, right? This fella built his house after it was done, right? The terrible fellow was like, fella, Ivan. He was going, ah, it's brilliant. You've done a good job there. Yeah. I don't want you to build another one like that. Took his eyes out. Just stopped him making an owl. Blimey. Why didn't he take away his trowel, then? He could have seen they couldn't have built a house without. Without a trial. You can't build house without trial. Yeah, I suppose you. I suppose he probably later thought that once he'd be nicknamed Ivan the Terrible. Yeah. Yeah. Why? Because you gauge people's eyes out. Yeah, but I don't want to build another house. I know, but take his trout away. What would I be then? Ivan the crafty. Yeah. Ivan the jealous. You know, I've been the spoilt brat, but Ivan Gouge someone's eyes. That is bloody terrible. I'm surprised you're not called Ivan the. Do you know what I mean? You're gonna get on a history. Like with Vlad the impaler. Yeah. He's mainly remembered for impaling. Yeah, he did a lot of other stuff. He did a load of great charity work. He did. The impaling is the thing that's really gone down in history. When were you reading about Ivan the Terrible or Ivan the terrible is the thing you remembered from this informative article. No, it was just little bits like that talking about him. There was a thing about someone who worked for that fellow who painted the ceiling. Sistine Chapel. Yeah, there was a thing. A woman who worked for him in his house. I love how you assimilate information when it's just bordering on the academic or just the interesting and true. It's wonderful. Either the terrible gouged someone's eyes out, spilled him in house. That fella who painted that ceiling had a woman work for him. Imagine if you wrote that down in an essay. Imagine if you wrote that in a school essay. Well, you probably end up with not. Not getting a grade or. Yeah, or thinking you turned up to. More than you have anyway. The woman who lived with. Yeah, the woman who lived in the shoe. Go on. Yeah, there's this woman who lived with him and she like, you know, go out and do all this shopping and that. Yeah, but because she couldn't read or write, he used to have to draw everything that he wanted. Why can't he just tell her? I don't know. No, but. No, wait. That's an excellent point. Could she talk? Yeah, but if it's a big list in that, loads of different colored paint. Why can't she draw? Draw on a piece of paper. Why did he have to do it? Because he's a better drawer. That's it. That is. We were just looking for the logic of the story. You found it. Player recording I don't owe you anything by the Smiths on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Carl, over to you. This is the time where we play, well, the world famous quiz, isn't it? Rockbusters, yeah, which is blockbusters, but with music. See you later. We've got a number of DVD's to give away, including some teachers DVD's. We've got a bunch of CDs here. And also Ricky Gervais's live stand up DVD animal, which is not good at all. I really would not encourage people to buy that is weak observations, poorly performed. I would recommend the office series two. On the rubbish in that. Awful in that you can actually see me forgetting some my lines. That's true. God. Right then, so cryptic clues. An example might be new. I reckon people will be staying in today because it's raining and that so might not have heard it before. So like all they have and they're not listening. Yeah, well, whatever. Okay. But you give us an example of the sort of thing that jeez all right, maybe don't. I'm a broadcaster. Yeah. Words are my tool. Go on. All right. Forget. Come on. Boldly. Three. Three clues, then. Here's the first one. It's a band or an artist. I'm going to the northeast. What you going there for? Good point. Good question. Right. Yeah. Going to the northwest. That's a different matter. Going to the northeast. What you going there for? Right. S is the initial. So it's a band or an artist who starts with an s. And that's the clue. Right. Second one. Oh, yeah. She's. She's related to the man in the lamp. Right. That's g. Right. She's related to the man in the lamp. Right. And the third one is the jamaican fella would love to live there, but it's a little bit pricey. Oh, God, I feel an accent coming. That's one way. You're gonna have to think about it. With the accent ds for that one. Right. So the jamaican fellow would love to live. Live there, but, you know, bit dear and that bit pricey. So give me some again quickly. Right. The first one. I'm going to the northeast. What you going there for? That's s. She's related to the man in the lamp. You know, that's g changes. And the jamaican fellow would love to live there, but a little bit pricey D s. So email in or text. And Ricky Gervais Fm co dot uk. What's the text? 83 XFM. Yeah. Brilliant. Play some odds. Yeah.

Who are you? Steve Merchant. Is that little bald man whinging twat over there? Carl Pilkington. Yeah. Sean only. All right, Rick. As you know, there's always junk lying around in this studio, and not all of it is rockbusters. Private? No. And there's. I'll just be flipping the playlist. Yeah, exactly. And I was just flipping through an old copy of the Guardian Guide from last week, the little listings thing. And, you know, people might have seen it. We did a. There was a documentary on this week about the transfer of british sitcoms to America and we did an interview for that because I'm remaking the show over in the states. I'm just flicking through and I just. I notice there's a little write up about it here. And it says. It says, quoting me. It says, we don't care if David Brent becomes a woman. Burble Steve Merchant, eyes bulging with imagined riches. No, my eyes bulge normally. That's not me being greedy, that's just me. I did on it when I sort of like, rubbed my fingers together and do that. Stupid Brent. People take that seriously. I know, I know. Yeah, it's extraordinary. Oh, some people got it. But I think the paper next day said Gervaise's mannerisms could have been transferred as dollar signs. Well, I was really sarcastically, I was doing it like that. I was pretending that I just cared about the money. Yeah, so irony, you see, people say Americans don't get irony. Most people here don't get irony. Absolutely right. That's why they think this shows rubbish. Yeah, I know. We fooled them. Yeah, we read the last laugh. We think it's really good. Carl, come on. That, that was that. Let's have some news. Let's do some proper radio. Have you. Although your news comes from Anna Nova, doesn't it? What would Doctor Fox do about now? 02:00 he do some amusing. It's coming up for two. And here is the news with Carl Pilkington. Well, like I said, it's just. Just headlines and I don't bother reading on it. No point. And it's all newspaper. It's not made up or anything. Let's see. Okay, imagine Trevor McDonald doing this. These are real news headlines. Okay, then. Well, they're real. They're real to Carl. Okay, here we go. And here is the news with Carl Pilkington. Bong man, hidden man, hidden wardrobe to avoid work. Yeah, good bong. Teenager gets stuck in washing machine. Bong Bushman has two right feet. Bong cow hit by train, lands on farmer's wife. That is the real news to you, isn't it? That's brilliant. I just think of the cow flying through the air and the wife going, oh, no, dutch man has two right feet. Yeah, he's having some operation or something. And what, they put the wrong foot on him? He's got two right feet or something. Well, maybe it was only a right foot that was available. Good dancer. In real news, I was. I followed that thing with. It was that fellow that got into the palace when Bush was there. Right? Undercover journalist. Yeah. I mean, it would have been a problem if he was a terrorist, but it's sort of like. And as the palace said, you know, all our tests are to expose terrorists, not journalists. Yeah, I just think it was. It was no big deal, really. Yeah, it was much more bigger deal for this than anyone else. Well, okay. Well, all the journalists in the world can pop up. As long as. As long as no terrorists get in. Yeah, we're all right. Exactly, yeah. A bloke just got through a terrace, now an ice cream seller. Yeah, that's right. Who's that? The waiting hand for thinking. I can't believe it's Baz bamming boing. From the Daily Mail. I think that's Gary Bushel. That's fine, that's fine. Don't worry about it. Yeah, but it's just that he. All he did wrong, though, was just lied on his cv. Well, I think he did. Everyone lies on their cv. Course. I don't think I've ever. I don't think I've ever done a cv. I tell. I did one once when I was at you do, and I was an events manager. I applied for a job at radio one for events manager. Didn't even get an interview. Yeah. So I just stopped the cv lock. Just, you know, the one knockback and that was exactly. Yeah. So you've lied on your cv, have you, Kyle? Yeah, load. Yeah, it's just. Yeah, go on. Come on. There was. Right, there's a job going at Granada. In fact, this isn't even lying. And I still didn't get the job. But just because you don't lie, it's not. Have you, like. No, you've got the job. Yeah, no, but there was a. They asked you loads of stuff, don't they, that you think. Now, that's got nothing to do with the job. I don't know why you bothering me. Asking me certain stuff. Qualifications, things like. Yeah, yeah, but. Well, it was. Languages. Yeah, right. What did it say? It just said, you know, put your name, put your address. Languages, right. And what. Oh, yeah. You don't speak any other language, do you? Well, I just thought English quite good. You didn't. No, I did, honestly. Asked Susan, I think you told me this before. Did you really put English quite good? Yeah. Honest to God. Didn't get. Didn't hear that. Well, you know what they meant now that you know. You know what your error was, don't you? Are you fluent in French, German, China? I didn't want them to think I've got loads of big words and that mean. Well, I don't use loads of big words and stuff. No, they may speak any other languages. It's any other languages, car. Not the way you can speak English. Because you're filling out a form. Yeah. Oh, it's like language is none. They assume you can speak something and they probably think it was English. And to put quite good, when you are English. Yeah. English is your first language. Yeah, I'm quite good at it. I see your point now. Yeah. It's true, though, isn't it? I'm not sure quite good is accurate. No. Poor English. Weak. Poor. A week. You didn't get the interview. Now, what did Suzanne say when you told you put that? She just laughed. It was too late. It was too late to do anything. How's her hair? Don't talk about it. She's off today, so is it right? Oh, she's listening to me. She's at home today, but it's probably. All right now in it because a bad hair day. Nice. Not today. You're scared, aren't you? No. I mean, I don't want to. Oh, you've learned your lesson that, you know, you can't talk about people like that because it upsets them. Well, plus I can't do it all now because we're doing pulp fiction later and it sort of involves the red, so. Brilliant. Excellent. There's me thinking that you're being considerate or worried about. You don't want to use up the material until later. Play record, Travis. Beautiful occupation. What's the best job you've ever had? Still, Carl, talk around. Is it still the paper round? Yeah. That's ridiculous. No, it's good, though. If you look at it like. You know what I liked about it? You. Your own boss. No, you're not. You're not your boss. Agent is your boss. All right. But then once you get out and you've got your papers and that, you sort of. You're on your own as long as. You deliver the papers exactly to the places he said you are in the time he said. Yeah. Freedom, isn't it? Any jobs you wouldn't do? Uh, I just thought of one that you wouldn't do with your sort of mild homophobia. Well, I'm not proxologist. What's that? Basically sticking your finger at other people's ass. Well, I wouldn't do that now. Why have you got to do that? What do you mean, why have you got to do that? Does anyone need that doing? They got a look if they've got a psych or something. Which trainee doctor makes that their speciality, you know? I mean, that must be right. We got our place, properties and it's. It's you, Meadows. You came last. Oh, seriously? What? I'm not the arse doctor. Yeah, you came last. A bunch. Yeah. Yeah. You got. Can't believe this. Yeah, that must be it, wasn't it? No one would choose it, no one was. Purely if they can have the brain surgery. Well if you're brilliant but you were shy, you couldn't look people in the face. Yeah, you can be, you could do anything you want, you know, just, just don't want to look at them. I just want to do their asses. Yeah, really just want to do the asses. Yeah, yeah. Look at Carl's face. You don't even know such a thing as an ass doctor, did you? No, not really specialized. He does nothing all day but that. Well he probably has a sandwich about 01:00, washes his hands. What do you mean he does nothing all day but that. You don't say that about brain surgeon, the thoracic surgeon, do you? No, but that all day. That, that's not good is it? Things that people take for granted. A dentist just looks in mouths all day. Yeah, but that. Oh that bum job, just think of that. Oh. So what do you need to know then there? It's a lot, lot to know. You got nice nails, no rough edges. Will you be alright because you got that job and not biscuits. The old people, you had nice hands, didn't you? Yeah, and I know a lot about biscuits normally. Biscuits, dear. Yeah, yeah I know which ones you like and that dear. What do they like? What old people like spore bonds. Do they really? Cuz that's my least favorite. I would never eat a bourbon. I could be starving and I wouldn't e a bourbon. If you want to let us know what your favorite biscuit is. But I'll tell you what, some, with all them eating biscuits, I bet they get ass problems, don't they? So you could double up, couldn't ya? You could be having out biscuits in the morning and checking, checking out. So why would you go and have that done then? What sort of problems then? What do you mean? Loads of problems. What? Prostate and they've got to go there. They have to like have a little, little you know. Well there was that, I told you that story, that bloke, um, um. It's not an apocryphal tower because it's about an orderly's report. And this, the bloke that filled out the form and what happened? He went into hospital basically with a sauce bottle up his ass. And on the report he said obviously, you know, pleasure in himself using a sauce bottle. And on the report he said that he'd been shopping at siteways and he'd come in with his shopping and he'd forgot his key. So he put his bags down on the step, right. And he started climbing up the drainpipe to get in, right? But as he was climbing up, his trousers and pants fell down. He slipped and fell and sauce bottom went up his ass. And the orderly said, this story would be somewhat believable if Safeway sold their sauce bottles with condoms already attached. That's like a game of Kaplan. Condom on it. I wonder if that was so he didn't want to get an infection from it or he wanted to use it on his chips later. So waste not, want not. Talkative arse blockbusters. We. We should give those clues again because we're not getting many right responses. Let's give them once more. You know what I think? Because the mentalists out there get his clues and their rubbish. So I think his clue must be so wild. I know that it's something wrong. Do you know what a pun is? Don't you? You can't change the word. You can't have. Oh, he's bald and he rides a bike. Who's that? Bicycle stipe. That doesn't count. It's gotta be Michael Stipe. For it to be correct. It's got to be Michael Stipe. Yeah. All right, well, we've got most. We've had. We've got two. Right, so let's hear the clues. First one was I'm going to the northeast. What you going there for? S. It's a band or an artist that starts with S. Right. And going to the northeast. What you going there for? Second one, she's related to the. To the man in the lamp. Right. That's g band or an artist. The last one. The jamaican fellow would love to live there. It's a bit pricey, though. All right, b's, ds, ds. Emailing or texting. Ricky Gervaisfm dot co dot UK or. On the text, 83. Xfm. All right. Dylan's, of course, playing in London this week. Yeah. And good luck. Classic. Bob Dylan. It's all over now. Baby blue from 1960 something. Bit of trivia for you, Steve. That is the last record we ever played on the old XFM before we were fired. I bet that was a moving moment for about eight people. I just thought of summer, you know, that. That. That thing we did about. They said that we just cared about the money. Selling it to America. Yeah. If we cared about money. Yeah. Would we be here now? Do you know what I mean? I think this proves that we don't do things for the money. Exactly. Jesus. All right, Carl? Couple of emails. Monkey Matt's emailed us. Who? Monkey Matt. I'm not. Yeah, go on. He says monkster. He's all right. He says Carl has missed a cracking headline from the sport hide and seek champion found dead in cupboards. I hope it's real. I don't know. I doubt it. Just looking through some of the news stories that Carl did make it into. Carl's news roundup? Yeah. This one you might interest in. Headline. Woman says partner ran off to become vampire. And it says a young mother says her partner has dumped her to become a vampire. Rebecca Roberts from Somerset says Matthew Barrett fell for a blood worshipping woman in a us cult. The 23 year old mother says he began shaving all his body hair, dressed in black, and used Rebecca's lipstick to redden his eyes. Rebecca caught him performing weird blood rituals in front of his computer at night, cutting himself to prove commitment, she said. I thought it was just a hobby. Everyone's got a right to one. I was pleased he found an interest. Brilliant. This is apparently from the sun. Apparently he's left to America. He's living in this Ohio based cult. But it's the last bit where she's been asked whether or not, if he came back, would she take him back? Sure. And this is where I wonder if the journalist, you know, our journalist, is supposed to just report the news. Be objective. I wonder if maybe the journalist here has maybe had some interference, made the. Quote better for them than. Go on. Because it says, I never thought this would take over his life. Now, if he came back, I'd say, fangs, but no thangs. Oh, dear. I can't believe. Imagine you're the woman, Rick, okay, and I've come round. You're the journalist. I'm the journalist. And I've come in and I've said, okay, I read about this. All I have to do is not say that thing. You've come. I don't see. You're obviously quite upset. Everything's gone. If he came back, would you take him back? Definitely not. Right. What would you say to him when rip came back? Just get lost. Right, but I'm really pissed off with you. Would you perhaps say something a bit more pithy? Not in this situation, no. He's upset. He cuts himself. He drinks blood. He's left me no soda. I'm not interested, mate, because. I tell you what. Go on. I mean, I like what you said there, but I wonder if we could condense that a bit more. If he came back, would you say, go away. Would you say something? Would you ever say something like, thanks, but no, thanks? No, because that sound, it makes it flippant. Because I'm really angry. I know you're annoyed and I'm upset, so I wouldn't say. I wouldn't say thanks. I'd say. I might say, no, thanks, but what if. What if you sort of said it, like, aggressively, like you gave it in the finger, thanks, but no, thanks, like. You didn't really sarcastically. Would you possibly. I might say, thanks, but no thanks. That'd be it. And that's. And I'd leave it there. I'd never. And I'd never change that. Sure. I'd never change those words. Can I ask you a question? Go on. Do you like puns? Hate them. Right. Countdown. I don't like qi. I don't like any of those posh Cambridge Oxford type. I hate puns. If you had to say thanks but no thanks in the form of a pun, what would you maybe say? I wouldn't. I never would I say thanks with no, thanks? I would. You know, I mean, I feel embarrassed that I'd even say, because I don't think I would even say thanks for no, thanks, but if I did go that far, I'd leave it there. Sure, sure. So, have you ever noticed, as I have gone, the similarity between the word thanks and fangs? Not really. It is very similar. Th there's a k. Fangs, very much g. It's in a. Well, the a, the n and the s. But that's about it. Would you agree? It sounds marginally similar, yes. Is it possible you might one day say fangs but no fangs? I wouldn't know. Right. I could put that, though, could I? But don't say I said it. Right. I mean, yeah, fangs, but no fangs. Yeah. This is the thing. This is the thing. Just if you ever read an article in the sun, the mirror, anything, do not believe it. Really, seriously, question and query it, because. If it ends with fangs. No, ends with a pun. Almost certainly. They never said it. Feeder. You know what I'm annoyed at now? Right, we've got another ad break coming up. How many ad breaks are we adding this show? I know, Carl, how many ad breaks have we had in the show? About three an hour. Three or four an hour. Three or four an hour. So that students. So 20 minutes. 20 minutes is wasted on shite. I mean, apart from the stuff we talk about. Funny you should say that, because someone said to me last week that they felt that there were more adverts. Now, on the show than they used to think, though. I think. Just checking some of the emails, I think that's because people are requesting them. They find them more entertaining than what we're giving them. But can't we sort this out? Don't go on about it. No, no. Can't we, though? Why can't we. Why can't we have less? Why have we got so many? Is it what happens? Oh, well, no. You can't listen to radio in every. After every record. It's bad enough trying to keep listening with the rubbish we come out with. We've got rockbusters there. Let's cut them back. Anyone got all three? No. No. Right, okay, so there's some. I'm gonna be angry. I'm gonna ban rockbusters because. Okay, go on, then. What are the clues again? Tell me the answer. Give us the one that they did get. All right. Well, they did get. She's related to the man in the lamp. What's that? That was Gina. That was Genie. Genesis. Right. Genus. This. Genesis. So the sister of the genie. Genie. Sis. Genesis. They got that. No, no. What does. What's the band's name? Genesis. No, no. Say the band name. Genesis. Genesis. Right. I don't get it. Because genie is nothing like that. Well, they did, so don't worry about it. Stop worrying about the ads. Don't worry about that. Right. The third one was the jamaican fella would love to live there. Go on. Looks a little bit pricey gone. Right. That was the initial ds. Dear streets. What? It's a dear street to live on. Dear streets. Oh, yeah. I've known a band. That's dire straits. No, it's not dire straits. It's not dire. Straight. Dear streets. The jamaican fella. Go. Make it sound like dear streets. Dear streets. Keep going. I've got it. Yeah, go on. Dear streets. Dear street. They got that one as well, so. All right, well, that's another one. They were jamaican fella saying dire straits. Right? Dire straits. The first. Not the same. The first one they struggle. Struggle with was going to the northeast. What you going there for? Well, you know, when you say struggled with. No one got this. No one got it. Didn't even attempt. Okay. No, northeast. Well, going to the northeast. What you going there for? Seal. Seal. What? Hole. Holes up in the northeast. Holly's. Yeah. See? Hole. Yeah. Yeah. So, right. So that works. Seal. So, Seal. What's that gotta do with the north, though? Seal. So I'd say, okay, that's the end of what. I can't believe we even, boy, about Rick. Right. I'm serious. That's the end of my. Go on. I'd love to hear some adverts now instead of that. So. Adverts are better than that. I'm just saying, Laura. Laura's one with one, but we'll give her that. Yeah. Just play the adults. I'm actually looking forward to the ad. Really looking forward to my. Black web all motorcycle club. We're all in love on XFM 104.9. Sorry about rockbusters. That's the end of it, definitely, because it's. It was dreadful. Do you know? I mean, it's not. Do you know? I mean, Steve. Yeah, it's quite funny. But that was. That was awful. I mean, we've apologized for that quiz so many times. I know. We've given it. I think it's two come back now. They don't like it. They don't like it because it's rush. That's to that people. No, no, that's the end of that. Less adverts next week. Sort that out because it's just. It's awful. 20 minutes of adverts. Do you know? I mean, it's not what people listen for, so. Right. Redeem yourself. Have you got the film thing you in? Right, yeah, I'm in a film. It's pulp fiction this week. Right, right. Change that a little bit. Tweak the storyline a little bit. Okay. It's just. Make it better. Yeah, it's just a. Do you know, I've talked about Susan's air on that. Yeah. About when she got it caught, didn't like it. So it's sort of about that. Listen to it. There'll be a question at the end. You can win some good stuff. Yeah, well, and this is the scene where they're in the restaurant. Do you know when they're about to do the robbery? Yeah, it's not a restaurant. Change that. It's a barbers. Right. All right. Okay. All right. There you go. Is there gonna be a question after this? Yeah. All right. Girlfriend came in here earlier, had a haircut. I'm not happy with it. Look at the state of that. Well, don't laugh. Yeah, I mean, I don't. I don't want to cause any fuss, but just. Just want you to sort out. Afraid I can't do that. Well, you can do that, cuz it looks a mess. Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ. Well. Well, you've got to do something because look at it. When she came through the front door at home? I thought Dave Hill out Slade had walked in. Funny, I was thinking the same thing. Look, we. I don't want to cause any problems or anything. She hasn't even seen it properly yet. She sort of had it cut and came straight home and didn't. Didn't look at it. Suzanne, just look in that mirror. Look what they've done to your head. God damn it. What is it, Suzanne? We're not gonna do anything stupid, are we? I'm the manager here. There's no problem. What you mean it's not a problem? Look at the state of the rare. Become. Cooperate and this will all be over in a minute. I'm gonna go home. Well, we're not going anywhere until they've sort your air out. I'm not walking home with you with your air like that. It's embarrassing. So. So let's just get it. You die. No, forget having it died. Just get it cut colors. Not a problem. Just sort it out. Get rid of. Let's see what we can do. Right, good. Look at it. Look at the state of it. I'm trying real hard, Suzanne. Just keep your head still there so. We can just hang in there, baby. You're doing great. I'm proud of you. Saw that bit out there? Just put that. My barber Susan, have got the hair of a chinaman. Have you heard that before? What's so funny about that? Is it. Is it serious or what? Freaking me out. If my answers frighten you, you should cease asking scary questions. It's almost over. There you go. No, it's not. It's not brilliant what I have to do on it. I reckon we'll have to buy her a hat on the way home. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Do you think Suzanne's listening? I like the fact that in that she's represented with a sort of dimwit southern accent. Yeah, your girlfriend. So I'm sure she'll appreciate that. I don't know what kind of copyright infringements. The question is, what did I say is odd about my hair? Odd about your hair? Yeah. Fans of the show will know that already, I'm sure. Yeah. So email in. Ricky Gervaism dot co dot uk or. Yeah, just email actually. Yeah, bud. Right. Yeah, you can win some tat. Usual address. That is a beautiful record. Yeah. This is Thunder Road by Bruce Springsteen as recorded by badly gone boy. You enjoy it? Good job. Badly gone boy doing his version of Bruce Springsteen's Thunder Rose. Good. Ff 104.9. Tricky song to do a good version of, but not good effort, not badly. Tell you what, he's also made a good effort. Go on. Stephen gunning with tooting. He's correctly identified that Carl's hair is like that of a Chinaman's. Or it was. Yeah. Many other people have been adding, how can we know what your hair is like? Because you are a bold man. So people are correctly language. Okay. On this show in general, I've told. You that, you know to be careful on that. Yeah. Why don't you try putting some effort into it? As you get Mondays off for this 2 hours, you come up with Rockbuster clue that no one can get because it was impossible. It wasn't even a clue. Okay, I got your headlines. I've done pulp fiction, right? I taught you about that fella, the builder fella and his eyes and that. You don't even know what you're talking about. You don't even know what you've taught me. It's sort of like you borrow information. If it's like one of those things that, you know, one of those things called read, write once, read many. It can just pass it on. And it's this. Yeah, yeah. When those CDs you can just play once you and information, it goes in. If you tell someone once, it's like you've lost it. It's like you. It's like past the parcel with knowledge. It's gone now. You don't even remember what you told me. The chain ladder. What just. You mean chain ladder, don't you? Shut up. It struck me when we were listening to his phone call to you, the very beginning of the show. I don't know if you might have missed that, but basically it was a message that Carl for Ricky. But about halfway through that message there was the feeling, I don't know if you noticed, but the words started to fall apart. It was like he wasn't going to make it. Every time Carl opens his mouth, it's the equivalent of walking across one of those rickety bridges. Indiana Jones. You might not make it to the other side. Anyway, we've had a few laughs and we've had a few insults. Yeah. So we're trying. So really honestly, I'll try and sort out some house as opposed to block rockbusters next week. Less adverts. I think ideally, what else? Better chat, better music, better presenters. No, come on, they can't read a monkey news. Was there no monkey news now it's gone on this week. Don't talk. There must be some monkey news. It's not like it's real news. You tell us stories about chimps from the 18th century. It's not. Don't give me nothing happened this week. You just didn't look at the Internet. Dead look. And there's no news. Nothing happened. There was one little bit of monkey news about how you can now buy tea that's been picked by little chimps because he. Because it tastes good, right? That's what they're saying. Right. Why does it taste good? What do they do to it? I don't know. It just annoyed me. Is it those chimps from the PG tips? Are they dressed up, having funny conversations. Everyone made a fuss about? You know, that's cruel, making them pick a piano up. Yeah. If I was a chimpanzee, what job I prefer. Sure. So, I mean, doing removals rather than something I feel, picking tea and that. He probably thought that was a documentary, a trailer for a channel four program. A little treat for them. Right, that winner of the DVD. Watch the behind the scenes footage because you see Carl's little round head. So they're enjoying that. Who won that, by the way? We're giving that away. Yeah, we forget. Don't bother watching the rest of the stand up, though. It's a bit poor. Leave you with $0.50. Outfit uncles in, 50 cent back next week. Fiddly one oh one.",
