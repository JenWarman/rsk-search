  "text": "Yeah. Darkness. I believe in a thing called love on XFM 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. You're Steve Merchant. In short, that's little Carl Pilkington over there. Where is he? There he is. There he is. All right. Hey, back then, back together again. The old gang. Yeah, started last week. Triumphant return. I think it went well last week, didn't it, Carl? Good show, wasn't it? You loved it, didn't you, Carl? Yeah, yeah. Now, uh, you weren't speaking to Suzanne last week this time because you said she had a haircut. Probably quite an expensive haircut. She's a lady in media. She's got to look good. She goes, probably doesn't go to the barber like you or just shave it at home. Probably spent quite a little bit money on it. She came home, she thought, well, my, my sweetheart, my lover, my sweetheart, my. You know, I mean, the man in my life is gonna. Is gonna love this. Well, he adores everything about me. He's gonna love my hair. She walked in. Hello, Carl. All right. You look like David from Slade, is what Hugh said to the poor woman and then talked about it on air. She was furious about that. So what did you do? She did listen. Yeah. She wasn't happy and she heard you. Slagging her hair off. Yeah. So this is probably annoying her now. Well, no, it doesn't matter. We can do a lot today. Cause she's at work and of course, no one's gonna tell her. Let's have a chat about a fat ass, shall we? Hold on. You are in so much trouble. That's realized. He has. He is a little bit worried. Oh, did you. Didn't you go and buy a coat? Or summer took her out on Sunday and treated her to a new coat and that. Yeah, but I offered a set of pay. I said I'd pay to have it done again. Oh, no, Carl, you have. Oh, God. Oh, my christ. So she listened to the show. What did she say? You got home, she'd heard you slagging her hair off. Imagine. Imagine that. He thinks that's a good thing to sort of. We've won the pools. Brilliant. What we doing? Well, you can have facial surgery now, love. It's sort of like. It's just. Christ, you offered to have it done again. Unbelievable. Yeah, but, yeah, I got home and she's like all being moody with me. Right? Yeah, you thought, someone's wrong. She must have listened to the show when I was slagging off her hair. Well, his first thought was, she's probably looked at herself in the mirror. Yeah, yeah. That barber's been round again. Yeah. And she just said, oh, that wasn't very nice of you, was it? Oh. So I just said, hang on a minute. I said, that's. That's what we do on the show when I'm slagging off, you know, chinese people looking old or whatever. I said, you never interfere. I love the fact she's got to get her priorities. I love the fact that she's in the same queue as a billion people you've never met. Yeah, that's fantastic. She's in the same queue without you, Carl. I don't think Carl has ever admitted he might be in the wrong, ever. Certainly not to your eye. So did you admit. That's so true, isn't it? That is so true. He's never admitted that he might be in the wrong. So did you, in this instance, agree that maybe you'd overstep the mark? No, I just said she. She took it badly, do you know what I mean? It's only a haircut. Yeah, yeah. Steve, you haven't seen it, so you can't. You can't start interfering on this one, okay? No, I haven't seen it, but I very much doubt she looks like Dave Hill from Slade, who, if I'm unless I'm mistaken, used to cut his hair with garden shears blindfolded. So you know what I mean? And did her teeth stick out? And she started speaking with a Brummie accent as well. I've got used to it now. Anyway, so at some point you came crawling back and you said, do you want me to buy you a coat? I just said, let's. Let's leave that. Let's go out and have a good weekend. Sure. But get your hat before we go. Treat that a new coat. And it's a nice coat, so it takes. People will look at that rather than looking at the head. So does it do flash? It's got obscenities across the back. If anyone who knows Carl's girlfriend is listening, tell her. And maybe you're a work colleague and you're listening to the show. I think this is terrible. Get her to phone him now. Get her to phone him now. I mean, number. What's the fat ass complaint line? Because you are in a deep shite. Cemetery gates by the Smiths, of course. Off the Queen is dead album. Lovely tune. Makes you happy, doesn't it? Absolutely. It's a nice song about dead people. Yeah. Beautiful. I just wondering what your opinions are, what your thoughts are on Britney Spears. Like the couple bit bored. I think she's panicking a little bit. I think she's a little bit desperate with all this Madonna stuff. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know, you know. Yeah, she's alright. I've got. Anything against a girl? Well I read, I think it was in hot Tickets magazine, free with Evening Standard. Oh I might get some free evening standards now. I've plugged that. Yeah, I just reading in there that I don't if it's still gonna happen. But apparently she was gonna do a little cheeky appearance at gay. Gay in, in London and obviously I was quite excited. I'm a Spears fan. Sorry. You know that's what that spells, don't. Yeah. Gay, yeah, gay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well I think it is a gay club. Oh sure. This is why, this is why I was ascertaining from the article. Oh they just said they've called it what sort of what it is exactly. Yeah. And it probably was gonna, she was gonna be previewing some of her new album live on stage at Jay and that's an intimate venue. Normally you'd have to see someone like Spears probably at Wembley arena. Yeah, I'm thinking I'm a Spears fan, you know, get a couple of the gang together, some of the lads. Exactly. Cruise down there. But then I read on in the article that apparently the doorman at gay were only going to let in regulars and the way they were going to ascertain if you were a regular was by asking a series of questions at the door. What? Testing if you're ready. Now. I don't know if the questions would be about the interior of gay or. The interior of someone else or just. Just general kind of like what direct. You to pass the. So you'd have to pretend to be gay to get in to see spears now? Yeah, I think so. So you're pretending to be gay to get into a club to see a bird. I'll give you a little quick test, shall I? All right. All right. Sorry, what's your name, mate? Paolo. All right, Paulo. Right. You haven't done a lot with your hay. You sort of, sort of let it grow out. I mean would you be putting product on a bit later? Because I mean you don't look very, I mean sort of like you don't. You look sort of quite, quite masculine. Quite. Yeah, well sort of like you didn't care, like you have no care about how you look, like you were. I mean normally it would be shaved. Oh, okay, we would say normally that looks about like three months growth there. Why haven't you? I've been ill. Nothing serious. Nothing serious. Okay. No, that's why. Let it grow so it's grown. Okay, so what, what time would you normally be going out then? I'd go out about sort of a guy about eight ish, 08:00 in the evening. That sounds a bit early. That's what. No, I go out about three in the morning normally. Right. So I thought, yeah, okay, right. So. That's right. That's right. Yeah. Where'd you go? Down sort of Compton street for a coffee and then onto gay with your little shaved head. Okay. Sounded pretty good. Can I just ask you one final question? 20 bender points. It's 20 bender points. I'm just gonna let you in. I'm just gonna tell the guards to let you in. But I guess one more question. Do you prefer knobs or tits? Well, knobs. Knobs. You love knobs, do you? Can't get enough knobs. So what, you hate tits, I assume? Loads of them. You hate tits, do you? Yes. Okay. What, even Liza Minnelli's. I don't know what to say. I, yeah, I love hers but not. In a, not in a straight way. Straight way. So. Okay. Okay. So you love, you love knobs more than tits. Right. Okay. Okay. In you go. Thanks very much. Uh, you know, Britney's on it. Oh, she's so sexy. Oh see that's what would give me away. Like great escape. It's just this last. Yeah, you just, well I mean I think you're probably a bit bi. Right? Yeah. But I mean, going anyway. Okay. The drinks are quite expensive. Pop your shirt off. Yeah. Hey, outcast on XFN 104.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant. Kyle Pilkington. You are Carl? Yeah. Not bad. Yeah. Just when you were talking just now about the gay stuff. Yeah, right. I don't know if you saw the thing the other week about the fella who's on that quiz show. Who sort of. Oh right, okay. Fella, straight sort of man, man, woman. What are you talking about? What? Tell me the what? What did you see? Tell me what you saw. It's like a kid come running in and he started seeing somewhat frightening. It could be an alien, could be a ghost, could be a pedophile. And you've got to get exactly what actually saw out of him. Right. What did you actually see? It's just this, this fella who's a, he's a woman. Right. Right. Okay. Right. Try and talk like a human being. Right? It's a quiz show that's coming on the telly, and it's this. This woman, right? Is it a fellow who's a woman or is it a woman? Both. That's why I'm talking about it. But what do you mean? Is it a pre op? Is it a transsexual or transvestite? Is it a lady? Boy? Is it an amaph for dying? What is it? Well, tell me. I'm telling you. It's this. It's a woman. Well, it's a man. Oh, fuck record. It's. It's a man. He is a man. Well, it's a tv program where they've. Got this diet or television. It is a transvestite. Yeah, so? But the problem is, I'll tell you, just because you don't know about the program is I don't know. I still don't know about it. I don't know anything about it still. I don't know. Woman, man. Man. Woman. Man. Man, woman. Tv. Tv program. Look, tv. No, it's a man who is now sort of half a woman and a. Man who is now half a woman. No, this is what's weird about it. He's got the top half but not the bottom half. What do you mean? He's got breasts and a wig, but he's still got his boys. Downstairs he's got his captain, the boys are still there in his wife fronts. But upstairs he's got a lovely pair of dumplings. Why do that? What? He's halfway through. But why not get it all done in one, one go? Maybe he couldn't afford it. Well, wait until you've got all the money. That just looks a mess. And who's he pleasing there when he. Wakes up in the morning and pleases himself? He can't believe he's lucky. He doesn't know where to start. No, but what? I don't understand it. I mean, you know, I don't want to seem. Well, congratulations. What you don't understand is just about everything. Yeah, right. What? I find it weird, right. I sort of get. I understand the gay thing, right? Do? Yeah. What do you mean? Well, you know. I know. Tell me the gay thing. Explain the game. Know, if you're a fellow, you like, you like men. I don't know much more than that. What do you mean you don't know? But what I mean is with a transvestite. What's going on there? What? What do they want? A transvestite is a cross dresser. See, I don't, I don't get that either. Because you mean a transcendent. That's a man who likes to dress in women's clothing. It's not necessarily. They're not necessarily gay. They're often not gay. They just happen to like wearing women. Those clothes are. Yeah, but then why not wear women's clothes that could be seen as a bloke straight like Susan wears jeans. No, but they. Yeah, jeans. But that's, that's, that's their problem, is it? They, they like being seen as a, as a, as a, as a woman. They like being seen as a woman. It's not just that. It's more comfortable. They'd wear a kilt. They like being seen as a woman. They feel more comfortable. All right. And what's the deal with this fellow who's got. We don't know who this fellow is. No, we don't know. This man is half a woman. He's called Miriam. I love this scientific basis. No, I. All he's done is add the tits. Done. He's probably had the hormones where we lived as a woman for a while. The last step that, because you can probably reverse the breasts anyway, because they're, they're probably implants and hormonal things. And whereas you chop your knob and boys off, that's, you come back the next day and go, sorry, I didn't mean that. I wanted me ears pierced. It's a bit more of a bigger operation to put them back. So doctors are probably making sure that. He'S just the top half done. You're not going to go back on what you've said, but now what's the. Top half being done? I could get you breast implants, give you a bit of hormonal treatment. It would be a great idea for. Next week and you could reverse it. What you can't do is grow a knob back. Well, you can. Last week you're talking about growing one on your own. Yeah, we've done that. But the thing is, the truth of it is, I think I do know about this story. I think it was a television program called there's something about Miriam, the conceit of which was that this pre op transsexual. So I guess that. Right. Yeah. Was masquerading as a woman. Right. And various blokes who didn't realize that this was a man had to try and seduce him her. And when they found out that it was actually a bloke and they, a lot of them had kissed her, they, they refused to let it be shown. I agree, though. That's just terrible. Yeah, that's. But, I mean, you know, that's awful. I. Yeah, I hated that. Yeah. Yeah. So. So what? I think it was a sky one program. Is there anything other than the Simpsons on Sky one that's worth watching? Have you ever tried to watch that? Have you ever seen cursed his home videos? Yes, but if we. Dogs on a slide. Baby's falling over. Do you know it's only recently reduced from an hour in length? Really? It's been an hour long. And it was just. If you haven't seen it, it's just like camcorder footage. Like, people falling over. I like an old woman at a wedding falling over and showing her bloomers. That's my favorite. I like it when it's Kirsty's home videos uncut. So it's kind of four old women, like, naked with their tits full, windsurfing. Oh, Christ. Imagine that. Does it whistle? Well, it's just. I mean, have you ever really sat and watched anything on. On sky one? No, that wasn't the Simpsons or Star Trek. I think that's what I watch on. I think that's pretty much what I watch. Wrestling. They have WWF wrestling cartoons and just the worst programs. I mean, I've seen a bit of the wrestling. It's. It's hilarious. It's like a station that's made by a 14 year old boy. Yeah, well, I think. I think that's probably what it is, isn't it? Yeah. I mean, that's exactly the demographic. Do you like sky one, Carl? I haven't got satellite ever, so. Why can't. Why not? I thought you'd have loved that. No, I would love it. Oh, Discovery Channel is all about slugs and that and weird stuff like that. Chimps. I got slugs the other day. There's a thing on one of the channels called monkey business. Yeah, I watched that. Yeah, because I was doing that thing, wasn't I, with Richard Bacon? Yeah, where you can watch the telly and that. You're talking riddles. You actually talk in riddles and forget a play record. You should be the gatekeeper in some kind of dungeons and dragons. All right, yeah, let me enter. Right. Yeah, but I was doing that thing with Richard Bacon. What can he mean? What can he mean? He is the wise man. Yeah, yeah. The upper half is. But is the bottom. Yeah. Player record, clash. Oh, yeah. Come on, train in vain. Extra firm on the 4.9. Johnny cash hurt on XFM 104.9. That's brilliant. Isn't it good? I'm Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant. Carl Pilkington. So what we done? We've done gays, transvestites. Have you done knob? Use it or. It's nice that you can talk about pre op transsexuals nowadays on the radio. I know. Without the fear of complaints or listeners. Listeners. That's the thing. If we had any listeners, we'd get complaints. We'd get some serious complaints if anyone cared enough. That's why we haven't gone to a decent station with, you know, we would. Never do on a real radio station. We could never do this. Why not? See, I'm not doing this to, like, mess about and offend anyone. I think it's an interesting topic. What you talking gobbledygook? Not really knowing what. Carl, for the first five minutes you couldn't talk. What? Okay. Although, although we've, you know that the, you know who's the biggest, most professional person in radio? It's probably Terry Wogan, isn't it? And it was at you that said, you can't tell what the sentence he's saying because he keeps coming up at the end before. There's never any picture. Yeah. So he'll just segue from one point to the next. So he'll be like, going on my holidays Friday. We're having a lovely time, says misses Dorothy Sheerd of Westminster. I'm thinking of going to Greece. Oh, and it's halfway. So he's got his knobs, but he's still got the tits. Yeah. Typical. Typical. Oh, hello, Paolo. Do you want to come into my club? Britney fan? Yeah. Well, it doesn't start for a while. It's. It's only about 08:00 and, you know, you're not going out for hours yet. I. But, um, might as well watch a bit of telly. We've got fa cup final. Oh, yeah, just. That's a good one, isn't it? Or we've got, um, the Eurovision Song contest. What do you want to watch, Paolo? Blow me. Well, I love all the camp and lame of the Eurovision contest. Oh, is that David Beckham playing? Because I love him. See what you've done? So you will watch the football, but you'll be mainly looking at the legs. And the tight shorts. So while Beckham's knocking him in, you'll be. Right. Let's remember. I don't. I mean, I never really looked. But when you see old clips of, say, early eighties footballers, the shorts are. Much tighter, I think. I mean, I don't know. I remember Carl, Sam, when he went and there was two strippers, a broken. A woman, and they whipped off their clothes at same time. And you look straight at the boys, everybody would. You would have done. Right, you do. Do you do. Do you look at his dude? What do you mean? You look at his dude? No, I'm just saying, if you were there, you wouldn't say two people on the stage. Yeah. Woman and a man. Yeah. Were getting the clothes off. Yeah, right. The fella took his pants off the same time as the girl took her knickers off. Yeah. Right. All I'm saying is it's human nature. So have a quick look, have a quick glance, see what's going on. I wanted to look at the woman, but she put her knickers back on quick. She didn't live opposite from you, did she? But just. Sorry, just to turn briefly to the shorts question. It's only because in the thirties and forties, they were huge shorts. Yeah. I mean genuinely massive, like. Yeah, a small child. Them as trousers, they were. I think that's do with comfort and decency there, isn't it? And then. But by the sort of eighties, there was barely any shorts there. I think that was fashion. But it's weird that it's. You feel like at some point someone's gone, guys. I mean, but that's. Well, that's what happened, isn't it? Because, you know, it, things get bigger and bigger. Bigger. Then they get smaller and smaller and smaller and fashion, like flares, drain pipes, heels. Flat. Tall hats. Flat hats, yeah. What do you make of the miniskirt? Long hair, skin head miniskirt again? I don't know. I'm sure there's been ten resurgences miniskirt since 65, whatever it was, you know, it's fashion. So the short, you know what. Do you know what I think, Steve? I think the shorts get smaller again before we die. I think we see one more tight little packet of premiership footballers running round with their awful squeezed like. Like the last chicken in a butcher's window, almost between wrapped up. Yeah, yeah. They just wore cling film short, so you can see what was happening there, Carl. Where'd you look then, cuz? You like football, don't you? We're doing rockbusters. Go on then. Right, we brought it back. This is where I give a cryptic clue. Wow. And some initials and you work it out and you win some stuff. Yeah. I was going to tell you what the prizes are. Needless to say, they're mediocre prizes for mediocre quiz. Sure. Okay. Yeah. DVD's in vhs. Yes. Yeah, vhs. Who still. Right, so there's three. Three of them. And what you can do now? We've tweaked it a bit. Okay. You can text in, right? So you can email or text. We've tweaked it a bit. 83 XFM is the text. Or it's Ricky Gervais fm dot co dot uk. Is that what it is? 83 xFm. That is good, though. It's convenient because who's got their laptop up and running and texting? So just shoot your phone. Brilliant. All right. Mine couldn't do that. I don't know how to do that on my phone. I don't know how to get. What you mean. What do you mean? My brother wanted my postcode. He said, text it to me. I couldn't work out how to do WC and what, you're an old man. So I had to write out double U c one. Oh, for goodness. I didn't know how to do it. Okay. It won't do it for me. It's ridiculous. Go. It's 83, nine, three, six if you have that problem. Right. Right. Come on, get on with the quiz. I don't know, there's too many numbers. Three. Three clues. Here we go. First one is this Teletubby has got lice. This Teletubby has got lice. This Teletubby has got lice. Right. The initial layer is P. So it's a band or an artist that starts with P. And the clue is this Teletubby has got lice. Right. Yep. Second one. I'm really already not holding out much hope for this. Working out. Gone. Uh, right. Second one. I've just messed that first one up. When I give it out later, it'll be. We'll. I'll sneak it in without. Right. Just don't repeat anything I say. You're an idiot. Player. Record. Play a record. You're a fool. Play record. No, no, no. You ruined it. It's. You idiot. It's off. Ludicrous. Red vines by Amy Mann. Brilliant, that, isn't it? Very good on XFM 104.9. Well, Carl mucked up rockbusters as usual. I mean, you know what? I like it when he mucks up early because it doesn't waste people's lives for 40 minutes. Realize. Mucked it up at the end. So obviously people already. They know what it is. They know what it is already. They've said Wiz police, isn't it? You meant to say knit instead of lice. You're an idiot. So that one's gone. So what have you got next? Right, so that's just an idea if you haven't heard it before. That's. That's how my head works. Right. This Teletubby has got knit. So poe. So Poe is a Teletubby. Yeah. So when he says cryptic, it's not only what the. What the answer is, it's what the question was meant to be. So, all right, so there's only two. So you got even a better chance of winning than that? Well, so the second one is. I'm saving that money to buy condoms. All right? Think about it. Easy. Too easy, JC. Yeah, well, that's. So everyone's got that one. I feel like saying it now. Yeah, but that's rubbish. Yeah, but you've got. Have an easy one in there, otherwise people get bored. First one was easy. We gave the answer. Yeah, but that's the easiest one we've ever had. Police. And the. And the. And the second one is. Yeah, when you're making bread, add a little bit of color for a change. All right. When you're making bread, add a little bit of color. Just change things a little bit. What are the initials? D. Just d. Just d. Right. So what you've got there? I'm saving that money to buy condoms. The initials JC. Yeah, that's easy. Yeah. And when you're making some bread, just chuck some. Chuck some color in there. I mean, change it. Yeah? Yeah, the clue. Clue changes every time. The clue changes every time. Unlike the Times crossword, the clue changes every time. It says 83 xfm. If you want to text it or. It'S Ricky GerbaisFm co dot UK. Rubbish. Pointless. David Bowie and Waterloo Sunset. Love that. Love the original. Yeah, love that one. Love the original. On XFM 104.9. Good works. David Bowie and the Kinks. Yeah, big time, big time. Reading the paper, this. Yeah, well, I don't normally read the paper, but I was having a glance through the Daily Express. Does anyone read the Express? Well, you do the moment. Look live on air. Yeah, read it out. And then 400 people have know what's in it. I just really. I was obviously attracted by this little news item. Gun raid by three saddams. Three armed men. Are they up to their old tricks again, are they? Yeah. Three armed men wearing Saddam Hussein masks were on the run last night after robbing a corner shop. The Raiders threatened the worker with a handgun and knife, ordering him to open the tail. Blah, blah, blah. Get money out. And it says that they also tried to rob an earlier shop earlier in the day. Police said, we are linking the raids because the descriptions of the offenders are very similar. What was the first one not quite get right? Well, they looked very similar. I think it was Gaddafi. Three gaddafis. Right. Because that's weird, because we've had three yesterday. We're saying. That's what I meant. Is it the same guys? Well, I assume so. I wouldn't. I don't know. I'm almost sure it'd be the same way. I didn't know. One's got a mustache, haven't they? One that they were. They all got mustache. I don't know, but I mean, it's. There was three blokes with masks, Middle Eastern, imperial. I don't know, but I imagine it's the same. I am. I've only ever seen really robberies being planned in films. Sure. So I don't know how it works. I assume. So, you say. Yeah, I assume at some point someone's got to get together. One of them. The ringleaders, got to get together and go, okay, well, we need to wear masks, obviously. Disguise our faces. I'm thinking of going with the regular stockings. No, no, I'll tell. It would be funny. Well, I don't want to be funny. Strike fear into the hearts of. Yeah. I mean, kill two birds with 1 st, we get the robbery and we have a laugh with fear. Do you say you want strike fear? Well, wear a mask. If someone is really scary, who's the scariest bloke in the world? Well, I don't know. Sadly saying, I've got three of them. I've got three of them. Let's all wear Saddam Hussein. It'd be a laugh. It's not. I don't want it to be a laugh. Don't hurt if we're having a laugh. And that's what I want, to make money and have a laugh. Well, no, it's. We are on a straight fear. We could also make a political point. I'm a thug. I'm not a political point. Why not? What political point? You know, maybe we're sort of stealing from the rich. Never mind Robin Hood. Let's Rob Barclays. Why are you making jokes? Well, I mean, don't worry, I'm gonna do with stuff. You're a comedian, you know, let's just wear the mask. Let's wear the masks. How did it happen? Did they go and buy them? It's separately. Look. Let's spread out. Look at you. Go to the joke shop in covent Garden. I go to the one in Southampton row. Yeah, brilliant. See, because there's so often the case that they're using masks. It used to be Reagan Thatcher. They were always. If I was the guy selling those, like when three guys came in, three shifty looking blokes to buy three identical masks. Yeah. In stockings. You're not going to rob, definitely. But just think of the police looking at those robbers every time they go past one of those awful sort of gift shops. They think it's just in the window there with. With Michael Jackson and Shirley bass and George Bush. Oh, Paolo can ask you something. I know you love knobs and that and you hate tits. Yeah. What about Shirley Bass's tits? Well, I mean, I'm a fan of them because I'm a fan of Shirley. But I don't like. Yeah, you're pretty bent. You are pretty bent. Coming in. Thanks. Britain. Britain is on in 7 hours. Yeah. What are you doing out at this time? No, no, I just came out to get some. Cooking the toilet, pal. Plenty of answers, Carl, so far for your I say quiz, I'm not sure that's really valid. Yeah, loads coming in. We're giving away some more stuff later as well. Without film thing that's coming up, coming off. That's when you put yourself into a famous film and you act out. Is that. Is that it? You've done. You've done the graduate? Oh yeah. Done the graduate. Done silence of the lambs on Billy Elliot. I liked it. What was your one? 6th. Yeah. So that's coming up later. We're doing that later. That's. Well, we'll look forward to that. Look forward to that. Pretty excited about that. Yeah. I'm assuming we've got some great music. Thorns. Yeah, thorns. Oh, I'm obsessed with this now. This is the thorns. And I can't remember. On XFM 104.9, brilliant strokes 1251. On XFM 104.9, I'm Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. Not done a lot. Maybe you should earn your money as you get to Mondays off for this 2 hours of nonsense. You're out on loads of stuff like Suzanne off. Yeah, brilliant link. Yeah. Talks about trannies. Yeah. Same old, same old. Yeah. Let's have something new. I've been looking around, right. On the. On the Internet for stuff on the Internet. Your Bible, where you get all your information about the world and the universe and morality from. And you know, like how I always say to you, I don't really read that much of it. I just read. Read the headline. Perfect, right. Yeah. Anna Nova. I've sort of nicked that idea to grab you. Nicked what idea? Well, to sort of get to the meat straight away at the top, do you know? I mean, the headline to the story and everything. What? Right. These are still. The headlines already existed. That was why you thought like this, though. All right, headline. These are all headlines. Right? Vibrating shoes could stop elderly falling. Oh, God. You know, racing shoes could stop elderly falling. Yeah. That's the story. You don't need to read on. That's what I'm saying. Well, could you read that anyway? Can't be bothered. Read on anyway. You have a look at that in a bit. Right. This is frustrating. Radio if you're sitting at home. No, well, it's not on. They've turned it off. If you ought to know more, you know where to go. That's what I'm saying. That's what they should do in the news. Get the news done in a minute. There's a good story about Iraq. Right, Bong. Look it up. Look it up on the Internet and over. Give us another bong bong. Family's sick of living on butthole Road. Oh, brilliant. Bong man wears same shoes for 60 years. This isn't that good. Some fella pulls a train with his teeth. And in lighter news. I love it. This one is very good. Last one. Man fails to break clothes pegs on face record. She's always good. Well, that's the one I did read on about. I love how all those. That's the word he read on about. Go on, then. Just, um. Why is that news? He fails to make a record. So did I today. I failed the long jump record today. Yeah. Didn't even take part. No, I was rubbish. But what are the rules on. On world records and that? I don't know if there are rules. There are certain things you can't. I mean, it's. It's the Guinness Book of Records, isn't it, really? There's the arbiter in it. Yeah, but is there anything. If you said you wanted to do it, would they say, well, you can't do that? Yeah. They've. They've stopped some gluttony records, obviously, things that are in danger. Anything that's illegal. Yeah. Anything that's immoral. Yeah. Like that. That american serial killer that just got discovered. Yeah. He killed 47 women. I don't think he can make that into the Guinness Booker record. No, because people would be trying to beat it, weren't they? But there was some, some other story about a feller eating watches and that. That can't be good for you. So why don't they say, look, don't do that, do something. You want to stay regular, you know what you mean? I just, I just wondered. What do you mean he was eating watches? He just said he was eating watches. He got about three in about a minute. How would he time it? Do you know what I mean, though? And then the other thing is, the one, the one that I was reading the world record with, the fellow who's pulling a train with his teeth. Does, does that make any difference that he's done it with his teeth? What do you mean? Well, what difference does it make? Well, isn't it, it's quite hard to pull a train with your teeth, I imagine. Well, it's pretty hard to pull a train. All I'm saying is, is it, is it because he couldn't beat the fella who's pulling it with his hands? Well, that's my point. There's that. I think there was one bloke with the record for the backwards running backwards 100 meters was sort of like eleven and a half seconds. And I was thinking, turn around. You'd probably, you'd probably have a really good go at that. Do you know what I mean? It's sort of like doing a marathon with a milk bottle on your head. Take the milk bottle off and see how fast you can go, you twat. But you can just tweak it like the fellow who has done the pegs on the face. Right? Yeah. His name's Gary Stretch Turner. Right. Right. So sort of cheating already if his. He's got a stretchy head. Right? You are. Right. You are one of the most stupid humans I have ever met. Well, get me in the book. Right, listen, so Gary, Gary stretched Turner, right? His record is 150 pegs. Yeah. He did it again and he only got 150 on. So he hasn't broke his own record. Right. But what I'm saying is if he tweaked it a bit more, would that make a new record? What? Well, if he said I've got 150 pegs on, but at the same time he's eating a burger. Or a world. Record breaker for pegs and eating burgers at the same time. Yeah. Just change it a bit. If you know you're not going to make it, just do something else. I'm assuming the rules are set at the beginning, Carl. That's it. That's where they say, right, you're just going to do the pegs thing. You're not going to introduce burgers halfway through, are you? Definitely not. And they have a go. I was on one leg. Not interested. How many pegs? 150. Can I just ask very briefly? I always got interested by the family. Had to move because they lived on Butthole Road. Yeah, I quite like that one. I don't know if I've told you before, Rick, where I used to live. I'm not going to tell you the name of the street that I used to live on, because. Not on air, because my parents still live there. I don't know, but I'm going to write it for you now. This is the name, the genuine name of the street I used to live on. Just imagine when you're at school, yeah. And in class, for instance, in French, you've got to say, they got. You've got to answer where you live. Jabit, wherever. Yeah, that's the name. This is actually the name of the street we lived on. No, it's not. I swear to God. Absolutely right. I could phone my father now, he could confirm that, because he doesn't want to. God. And I tell you that. But listen, do you know what worries me? It's the apostrophe s. I know, because that's blatant. Yes. Amazing, isn't it? That is incredible. Embarrassed. So if I look that up in. The Bristol, you will find that in the Bristol. A to z. I swear. That is really. Why have you never told me that before? I can't believe I haven't. That's embarrassed now. Do you know if, whenever I have to phone up, if I have to give that address, I always spell it instantly. Really? Like somehow that will hide it, that'll disguise the name. But it's interesting, my friend Rufus, his parents lived in a place called Fokkingham, right? This is amazing. When he was growing up, they lived in Fokkingham. They moved to a village called fingering ho. No, I swear to God. Really amazing. Oh, perhaps you come from an amusing town or street. Hello, fingering hole. Or fucking. Well, that's my business. Well, this, this family who's sick of living on butt Hole Road, right, said the thing that pushed them over the edge was the sign was outside their house and tourists were always coming, sort of having the picture taken with the pants down next to the sign. Oh, no, that's the thing that. What's it called? But hole Road. But whole road. Yeah. Well, that's bad luck, isn't it? That is bad luck, isn't it? Who named it that though. Yeah, but it's not as if they've named it that after they've moved there. They bought the house knowing. Oh, there's a lovely house here. So where you live, what road it's on? Well, I'm gonna go. Well, it doesn't matter. Look at the house. Yeah, yeah. Where am I going? Where am I seeing this? Well, I'll take you there, I'll take you there, I'll take you there. Well, you don't need to look, just don't, don't look at that sign. Just come into that. Lovely house, isn't it? It is nice, yeah, well, my family. Wants to come later to other. Well, just turn to. I'll meet him by the bus stop and I'll drive them here. You don't need to. You don't even know where you're going. You just. You just sort of know, won't you? You'll know from then on. How will we get letters? I'm delivered to me. If you want, I'll bring them round. Don't worry about that. Don't worry about that. That's incredible. But I can't get over that. Where Steve used to live. That's extraordinary. Anyway, if you perhaps live in Tits Avenue. Yeah, you know, or wankling drive, just get in touch, let us know. We're not really interested, but fill up five minutes, let's play a record. Let's come back with another of Carl's amazing queens. I'm going to spunkton later. If I was your girlfriend by prince on XFN 104.9. Yeah, wicked of a Steve merchant, big time. We've had quite a few calls. Greg used to live in a place in South Africa called Arse again. Arse again. Ask a guy. Paul's friend's parents live in fart town just outside Leeds, which is nice, isn't it? That's just ridiculous. And Dean used to live in Butts farm. Yeah, that's. Yeah, that's obviously. I assume they're free range, but not so battery farm, but yeah, that'd be great to just name a town. I think if I. Yeah, I was thinking if I was a, like a bolty billionaire, a Bill Gates type figure, I'd like to buy somewhere like, say, Manchester, and just rename it whinging on the wall. Whinging on the wall. Yeah, yeah. And make them work. We can work Mondays. Exactly. They'd be obliged to. That would have to be what it's called. Against the rules. Be like mayor. Yeah. Oh, it'd be great as mayor, wouldn't you? Well, you want to be mayor of Chinatown, don't you? I'd like to be mayor of Chinatown. It seems to me that there's not a great deal to do. No, because it's not really a town. No, exactly. But who can we talk to about that? Who can go say that you've got to stop calling this a town because at best it's a novelty street with some slippy pavements near restaurants. I actually got stopped the other day by two tourists who said, do you know the way to Chinatown? And I really wanted to say to him, it's a disappointment. It's not a town. Seriously, it's not worth it. Pop in a record shop, do something else. Yeah, pop in Garfunkels, have some delicious sausage and mash. But you'll get to Chinatown. You'll go, this is not a town. Yeah, yeah, would be. Uh, have you got a town hall? Mmm. Got a better shop? Yeah. Not really a town. I don't think you could build a town entirely out of restaurants. That's not enough. You need more stuff. Oh dear. A lot of old people have noticed there, Carl, aren't there? Let's leave that, eh? What? We'll leave it. Leave the old. Leave what? Just got to John, who's just emailed and he said, my secondary schools. My secondary school was on a street simply called Bellend. Belle End. Really? Yeah. That's great. There's a road in Cricklewood somewhere called Clitter House Drive. Clit house? Yeah, I don't think you can really get that. You can't get them on that. That's fine. No, that's fine. No, that guy's just over the laugh. Just taking the mick, get a lot, that sort of thing. There's a place in America, apparently Ben's emailed this in his place in America called my anus. My anus? Yeah, I think I've heard that. Yeah, yeah, my anus. Yes, I have heard of that. That's, that's, that's unlucky. Oh, yeah. That is unfortunate. Where'd you live? My. Where do you live? My anus? I've got a letter for you. Where should I. Alright, don't get cheeky. Anyway, just rather than reading out the a to z, right, are we doing rockbusters? Answers? Yeah, come on in. Listen, this is, this is built, this has got Chris Moyles, the breakfast show on Radio One, this sort of stuff. Have we got a winner, Steve? We have. I'll check that in a minute. You find a. Found a good winner yeah, the Rockbusters clues. The first one was this telly. Tubby has gone ice. Yeah. Rubbish. You ruined it. Right. The second one. I'm saving that money to buy condoms. Too easy. Johnny Cash. Not as Johnny Cash. Rubbish. And the third one was, when you're making bread, add a bit of color for a change and so, you know, change the colour of it. Right. Right. That was dye doe. They got that. Give us a winner. Well, this. The reason I've given this person the prizes is just because she's from Switzerland. She's listening in Geneva, in Switzerland. So, I mean, good luck to Tina and she wins those prizes. Did she want to win the war? Don't know. I don't think she had an opinion, really. Sure. Yeah, they say that, but I reckon. Reckon they want you as to win. Really? I reckon so. Do you think that was true of all the wars? They were always on our side, really. I'd get her to just. If she's doing. Most swiss people, maybe sort of like over 50, want to win the war. The second world war. Yeah, the main one. So just, just, just as a poll, in her opinion. So ask people over sort of like 50 or 60. Right. Just quickly do it in the next ten minutes. Who did they really? I say neutral, but who do they really want to win? Yeah, we know you're neutral. Germany. We come up with great games, don't we? Eh? Bad day. An REM on XFM 104.9. It's Carl's quiz. It's a classic film. He's done some jiggery pokery. He's in the film. It's his favorite film of all time. I thought the elephant man was your favorite film of all time. It's up there. But. But this is like this. This film's got everything. It's got hilarious bits in it, it's got sad bits in it. I've got the headphones on because I've got to hear it and I don't usually wear headphones, but, um, I just realized how noisy I am. Does that go out when I'm sort of. Does it really? Yes. So when I'm sort of like, tapping and writing in that, you can. Because it's really clear, everyone can hear that. Really? Yeah. The thing about that microphone, Rick, is it doesn't just pick up your voice, it picks up all the things. Oh, that must be you scratching now. I don't know what it is you've got there. Some kind of rash. Well, look, look, it's eczema. What's that? Oh, God, what's that one, then? That's just one of your fat. What's that? Um. But, yeah, it must be irritating to listen to it. Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. If your voice weren't bad enough. And moving the mic. Moving the mic, then that makes the. Noise lean, eating sandwiches, drinking coffee. Yeah. Right, come on in, Carl. Right, so the film is, Kez, you got to listen to it properly at the end, there'll be a question about what's happened in there. So you gotta listen to. I love the fact that in pole positioning, in positions one and two of his favorite films of all time, it's the Elephant man and Kez. Yeah, that's brilliant. Go on. All right. Am I leaving the mics open a bit when this is going out? Let's have a listen. Don't talk then. Right, just put that hot dog down, Rick. And this is the bet in Kes, where it's the teacher and he gets up and he has glover. What's his name? Is it Brian Glover? No, no, it's the other teacher. The other one. Anyway, go on. All right, so here we go. Things that have actually happened about you. Casper. Casper. All right, all right, all right. You haven't been listening to a word I've said, have you? Yeah, I heard some of it, yeah, you. Some of it. Just stand up. Always somebody, isn't it? Right, now you're going to tell us a story about yourself. What sort of story? I want you to think of an incident that's happened to you sometime in the past that is true and that you think will interest the rest of the class. All right, all right. What about. I work on a radio show at the weekend, I'll just do. It's 2 hours and it's with Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant and just sort of play music and tell stories and stuff. Kind of stories, whatever. Like last week, it was science. We were talking about this lad who was growing a knob on his arm, sir. It's weird. It's tricky, sir, because, like, with Ricky, he gets bored quick and he won't listen to the stories and he'll start squeezing my head. All right, all right. I'm not interested in what he does. That isn't normal, is it, sir? That, I mean, sure is a bit gay, is he? Just messes about, though, do you know what I mean? I try and, like, come up with good stuff, like monkey news and like quizzes and stuff, but then he'll just, you know, Ricky will just mess about. I mean, on Saturday he did it again. He squeals me head. U o Z e. All right, now. Tell us what it is. It's when. It's when he gets me head and he puts one hand on the back of it. Right. And he puts the other hand on the front of it and he just sort of swivels. Oh, swivels. Not. It's spelled s w I d r. How it. Damn. Today, how many times a day does he swells it? It depends what time he, you know, what time he gets in. If he gets in about 12:30 he could get a good three in. But I think, you know, I don't. Don't really want to talk about. The effort. Well, that's. That's the best thing you've ever done, Carl, so that's. That's Kes, right? Yeah. Got some good prizes there. Not bad. Yeah, good stuff. Question is, how many times did I say Ricky can get? How many. How many head squeezes can he get in before the start of the show? All right, so if you were listening properly, the answers in there. All right. And win some. Got some good stuff. Some DVD's in there and some CDs, including some Jimi Hendrix stuff and other odds and ends. Good stuff. Brilliant. And just text in 83 xfm. All right. All right. Eddie and the hot rods. Do anything you want to do on XFM. 104.9. All right. Steve Merchant, Carl Pilkington. We've had loads of entries for the. How many times did I squoze his head? Well, the answer was three, wasn't it? Yeah. And who's the winner, Steve? Let's give it to John. He's emailed in. He's got it right. He said he squeezed your head three times. It's not squozed, is it, Carl? That's incorrect. It squoes, isn't it? It depends how you say it. Well, it doesn't really, because it's nonsense anyway. It's not a real word. But you squoze my head. Yeah, I will squeeze your head. Do you know what I mean? Yes. What line you're getting in? Sure. Tents? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Any monkey news? And the educating Ricky. Anything else? I don't feel that you've earned Monday off yet. Because it's just 2 hours. You only did about five minutes of it. Yeah, well, that took a bit of time to make. Yeah, but I bet you didn't do it Monday. I bet you did it on another day. I had to come in one, didn't. Yeah, you will do that on another day. So you're taking the piss even more. So you're doing it when you should be doing other stuff. You still got Monday off and you've got 2 hours here, so you're laughing either way, so. Don't give me that so. Do you know what I mean? What else you got? Monkey news. Well, let's do monkey news. You want to do it now? Yeah, we may as well have some monkey news. Let's have some monkey news. You made enough noise there. You want to. Sorry, but it's. Sometimes I like to move around. Lounge and that. And at the mic. Sure. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's have the jingle. We've not heard it for a while. Oh, chimpanzee that. Monkey news. You fucking. Right, I haven't read this through properly. Right. What do you mean you haven't read it through? Basically, right. It's. It's. It's about problems with chat rooms and that, right. A lot of people. It's like the new way of meeting people and that in it. Now, chat rooms, you get on there, right? If you say someone was having a meeting with someone they wanted to meet, right? Okay. Right. There is no. There is not an animal in the world. That story. Did they get married? Was. Three months later she realized, oh, there's a lot of bananas gone from my fridge. I want to divorce. This is what you say, that monkeys can do shakespeare after, if they're given the time. No, that's not it. Let's not get into the conundrum, please. Let's not get into that debate again. It's about. It's about this one. This one. So this chat room, right? And the thing is, we chat rooms, you have like a big boss who's looking over it and making sure nothing dodgy is going on. Right. Right. So certain keywords come up and so anyway, they were. They were looking over it, trying to look for. For dodgy stuff, but they kept coming over, like really strange things. Like, instead of saying, do you want to meet in a restaurant or bar? Right? It'd be like, do you want me in a tree? What tree do you want me? Right. Okay, I'll see you later. I'm just gonna listen to the end of it anyway. You're an idiot. You're an idiot if you believe that shit. Honestly. No, I'm just telling you what's online. Let's. Let's hear the rest of it, how you are. You're nearly ill. You nearly. Okay, well, I don't the pc term for this, so I really apologize. You're nearly retarded in some aspects. Instead of sort of saying, wear something sexy, they'd say, make sure you bring plenty of bananas. Right. You're talking absolute. Okay, are you making up the monkey news now? Because you can't find it anymore? And instead of saying, should we get married, they're saying, how swollen and red is your ass. Yes. Stupid fool. Mark Ronson and ooey on XFM. Well, what a great show. Mm hmm. We've had. Informative. It's been fun. Yeah, we've learned some, haven't we? What have we learned? Well, we've learned the car is an idiot. Yes. He believes that monkeys can get on. Top of a confirmation of. We always suspect it, but that's that. I just read a little email from someone who just said that in Northern Ireland, there is a town called muff. Is there? Yeah. It's worth knowing. Yeah. What else do we learn? Monkey news. No one's got anything like monkey news on radio, have they? Think of that as a boast. Yeah. No one has got anything like this goat. Yeah. You call that a boil? Look at that. And look where it is. Brilliant. We heard sadly back from that woman from Switzerland, haven't we? I knew you threw out a question. Yeah, I just. I just thought I wanted to find out whether sue the Swiss. Really. Well, I say they're neutral, but I was. Soon they'd be rooting for us and keeping quiet. Whenever Germans went through, I went, oh, yeah, yeah. Whoever wins. Yeah, but you want some chocolate? Yeah, he's a cookie cockin yeah, I mean, sure, they better, they better want of us to win because it wasn't for us and we'd have let fascism go in there and they'd be speaking bloody German and Italian all over the place, wouldn't they? I think they do. I think they do what? They do speak German and Italian. Why? Why don't they just couldn't be bothered to come up with their own language. And they chose that one, I suppose. Well, they chose those. What's the point of being foreign if you don't speak English? I've no idea. You'd have to ask them. That's mental. I don't know. What would I do if I went there? Why? You wouldn't. Why would you go? They don't speak the language. You're gonna have to choose a language to speak English. Even the Dutch. They've got their own language, but they don't speak. Sounds silly. Yeah. So they speak English. Course they do. You see. Do dutch people? Yes. In Amsterdam with clogs on there. Be there. Be chatting in English and proud of it. Yeah. Oh, God. There was a. I was there once and there was a. There was a mouse, right. Just there on the stair. It was a little mouse with clogs on. Yeah. Where? Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, that's languages. We learned about languages, didn't. I'm not a linguist, but I pretty much think that's what happens. Tell you something I learned in the week. Go on. Yeah. There's been one thing that. Definitely only one thing this week. It's a good one, though. Don't insult Suzanne's hair. I've learned two things. Go on this week. Yeah, right. Don't put your dresses on over your head. Mercury may look nice, but bad for you. Go on. There are more moves on a chessboard. Than particles in the universe. That puts you off learning it, doesn't it? Well, no, it's a possibility. No, no, that is. It is. He said that us. Yes, that's right. It's the possibility. Because it's especially tends towards infinity because no two games the same. So it's not that you've got to learn that many moves. It's not like. I don't wish to criticize Rick, because I know you were trying to inform him. Then it's a good job you're not a teacher because as you gabbled the phrase, it tends towards infinity. Yeah. It kind of came out as. You're one of those kind of foreign students who's gone and they, you know, sometimes they put. They put the tape recorder by the lecturer. Yeah. Listen back to that. It's something towards infinity. I'm not sure it tense. Towards infinity is talking about tense. I not understand. Cuckoo. So, yeah, we've all had a good. Time before the great time. Can I just say to everyone, have a great Saturday. All right. See you later. You like. You like the thorns. You played the thorns. I think you'll enjoy. This is an old track from Hawksley. Workman. Brilliant. Bad name. Good song. See you next week.",
