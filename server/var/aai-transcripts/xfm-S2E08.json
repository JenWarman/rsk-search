Oh, God. Oh, that's not to go to capital library to get a couple of records I wanted. Right. Places falling apart, the emails not working. It's so shoddy. He's had two weeks off. I mean, they are really. They might as well bulldoze this, honestly, because for all that, you know, it's the. And we get paid. Peanuts. You get paid. You. Oh, and it really annoys me. They have to fight. Anyway, one is 4.9. I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steve Merchant. I'm Carl Pilgrim. Carl, you're back. How was it? What? The holiday? Yeah. Well, it wasn't awful, was it? Because my dad was in. Was in hospital. Oh. But he wasn't. He wasn't doing the holiday. Not during the holiday, though, was he? You came back from holiday and then found that out, didn't you? Yeah, but it happened when I was on holiday. Did you know that though, when you're holiday. No, they didn't take me phone with me. Well, that's. I got a feeling when I was sat there because it normally happens. Beach, was it, when I first went away. So that old fella with his packet. Out when I went to a beef. All right, I. I had a feeling and I called all my dad had, punched it along. When they say you had a feeling, what do you mean? If he just, like, I should call home, there's something not right. Well, this very specific feeling, how did that manifest itself? What kind of feeling of that tingling thing. I'm getting a bit of a lung feeling. A bit of a dad lung feeling. That feels like a punctured lung. I'm done. But anyway, the holiday was good. We talked about it last week. Well, let's probe Karl about his holiday later, because, you know, that's the sort of thing that audiences will stay tuned for. Rick, I'm pretty certain you know more. About this radio business than me. You know, you hooked them already. Indeed. Yeah. Well, also I'm thinking we've got nothing ever. Now we rather say that. No, I resent it. I used to put a lot of work in, but now I, you know, I think of the money, which is, you know, for me, pretty shoddy. I don't know. Well, exactly. Yeah. And, you know, the whole thing is. The whole setup. It was raining today. I thought I should have a cabin, you know. Then the sun came out, so I walked in again. How are you? But I'll tell you what, I got a bit criticized last week as well. I only played ballads and same songs. So I'm gonna rock out this week. I've been at the capital library to get some good tunes. And what about a little bit of AC DC? Me? All night long. Let's hear it. Well, that's cheered me up. In a better mood now. Yeah, good. That's great. That's three. Three rock out today there. Well, yeah. Legs that, maybe stones. Brilliant. Yes. Some of the classics. Yeah. When are we gonna talk about Carl. Or we run out of stuff? Ready? Okay, let's go. Okay. Now? Uh, yeah. So where did you go, Carl? What was the story? Um, it's my birthday. Right. Went home after doing working with you a couple of Saturdays ago. Right. Girlfriend was like, open your card, open your card. And I said, no, it's my birthday on Monday, I'll open it up. You obey by the rules. Certainly. Your birthdays, birthday rules. Well, there's no point. Well, exactly. Chaos leads that way. Not an anarchist. Never has been. So anyway, she kept going on, and it was doing the heading. So I said, all right, I'll open it. So I opened it. Ticket fell out. Surprise holiday to one of the Canary Islands. So. And what was your reaction? I mean, first one was, we haven't got enough money. Right, for this. But I didn't want to ruin it. So I didn't. I didn't go on about that. And I said, oh, great. So I can't wait. In that tone of voice. Well, it was good timing. Who was tired and everything. Mmm. And I'm not a big holiday fan, but the timing was, right? Yeah. I mean, it's the same as last night. I don't always like a curry, but last night you're in the mood, you get that sort of. Oh, yeah, curry feeling, and then lo and behold, like, are you worried in the curry? Sorry. It's weird, the paranormal, isn't it weird? Isn't it weird they work in mysterious ways? Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, right, the island, if I was on. Wish you were here, I'd probably say it's a bit barren. Okay. Not much there. But if you get a hotel, you guarantee good weather, are. You know what I mean is it'll be a good holiday if you get a hotel, right? The weather's always good. So you're. So you'll have a nice time as a comma. Yeah. And all that. And the food was all right. And everything was going all right. I was just having a nice, relaxing time. And how do you sort of spend your time on a holiday? You just lie around. Is that sort of holiday, just lying around? I bought a book. You bought a book? Yeah. Okay. Ghosts. No, it was short stories. Right. No, it was about, like, special days in our time and time before me and stuff. And it was like. It was telling you about how in, I think it was 1814, the Thames, frozen up. Yeah. And all these stories are told by eyewitnesses. Yeah. Right. So there's some fella who was around in 1814 and the Thames was frozen and people used to put market stalls on there and they'd do the shopping. It was like. It was like. Like an Oxford street. Was that mad liar Charlie? No, because he's famous for that. Yeah, yeah, sure. You know, I was mad lie Charlie. Yeah. So I was reading that and then after a couple of days was a bit like, oh, boring. Yeah, you can do. You can only do sort of so much lying around and so much reading. So, Susan, let's go on the beach, have a walk. You ain't gone on the beach. Where'd you been up to this point, then? In your room? No, just like, around the pool. Just relaxing and having a swim. In that? Yeah. So she said, let's go on the beach. I said, all right, then. Yeah. So, wandered down to the beach and first impressions are, yeah, it's all right, it's clean. Your criteria is so basic, it's rude. Hotel, yes. Roof, good. Food, adequate. Beach, clean. Next. So I'm walking along and everything's good. And, you know, there's a woman feeding fish bread, which I thought, that's different. I love that. He likes originality. He loves a bit of originality. He was feeding fish bread. This woman was there, like, up to her knees in water. Yeah. And she was stood there. Was that a sea chucking. Yeah, all right. Chucking this bread. And I thought, what's she doing? And I stood there and watched for a minute and there was little fish coming up, having the bread. I thought, oh. So I carried on walking and everything's going well, and then this fella comes towards me. Everything's going well. Yeah, that's falling over. Clean, clean. Feeding bread. Two points originally. Fella comes walking towards me, only got no pants on. Oh. So I said, susan, what's going on? So she said, oh, yeah, yeah. It's, uh. She said, yeah, it's a nudist. Gonna be a long story because. Could you pull that coffee can you give me that coffee over. Sorry, sorry, this is really bad. Thank you. Just amuse yourselves while we. Thank you very much. Cup of coffee? Thanks. Yeah, cheers. Cold, right, good. Okay, so, great. Thank you. So she said, yeah, it's a nudist speech. So I said, well, what? I said, we're all mixed. It's all mixed up. Normally, on a nudist speech, it's a nudist speech. You don't go wandering on there when you get clothes on and that. So it annoyed me a bit because there wasn't any signs. So this fella's getting closer. Well, the knob out was a sign. Yeah, right? So he's getting closer and he walked past me. It was an old fella and he walked past me. Had a hat on and a little pipe and a big rucksack on his back, right? So he got me strictly naked. I'm walking along and I'm thinking, right, why do people want to do this? So straight away it was. I wasn't on holiday anymore. Because most of the time when I'm on holiday, I don't think about anything. Right, your mind's a blank. I just switch off, right? But all of a sudden this. This has got in the head now. And I turn around to look at him and check out his eyes and the bag. And this bag, right? I swear, it was massive, right? What? You had a massive bag? The bag. He's rucksack. It's rock. All right, okay. When I said, he said, there's an old couple coming towards me. I said, what was lower, the blokes bollocks or the woman's ticks? And he said, well, that was another point. She might as well wore knickers. That's what he said to me. So you saw the bag. So annoying me. Yeah. Because the whole idea in it, this is what I think. I mean, I might be wrong, right? Might be wrong. Chances you never have been before being nudist, right? What's it all about? I'll tell you on that. On that point, Carl, let's play a tune. Let's come back and we'll discuss. We'll discuss that very issue. We have. We've got some ideas. We did chat about this last week, Carl, in your absence. All right, well, we'll play the coral. Okay, good one. Yeah. Coral, dreaming of you on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais with me, Steve Merchant and Carl Pilkington. If you just joined us. Carl is walking down the beach. Yeah. And a man has just passed him with his knob out. Yeah. His testicles out and his huge, huge bag, apparently. Right. Now we're gonna. We'll sum this up, you know, quick, because we talk about last week. You know, you did. You did call me and tell me some of these things. And we. We sort of mentioned it last week, but you just want to say you're. Just give us your thoughts on unity. Well, what I don't understand is, right, nudity. I thought it was all about, you know, sort of being free. Yeah. Natural, letting the breeze, you know, blow around you. And that. That's. That's all I can think is of, like, the bonus of doing it. But you can get that by just having a pair of shorts on, right? Because I'm not one for getting my kit off. There's something a bit weird about it, isn't it? Normally if I go for a walk on the beach, I'll. I'll put a shirt on. Sure. But leave it unbuttoned. Yeah. Tease the ladies. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, but it just feels a bit weird. So it's best to cover your back anyway, because the sun. Yeah, but when I saw him and I thought, well, right, is he doing it to sort of be free and be comfy and all that. And then I thought, but he's carrying a big bag. I've got a pair of shorts on. And I'm not looking at him thinking, I bet he's really comfy. So, I mean, I wasn't going, I can't wait to get home and get me shorts off these. They're really annoying me, these. So. And that's just it. I don't get what it's all about. Sure, sure. Well, I'm okay. Well, my advice to you is don't, don't, don't. Don't go to nudie speeches again. Well, I didn't. I didn't go again. Do you play volleyball? Nope. Well, there's nothing in it for you, to be honest. Kyle. Do you ever walk around the house nude? Not really. Only if, like, it's quickly to sort of jump out of bed and go and get a glass of orange. But I've got to be careful because living on a high street, this flats right across the way, looking in. Yeah. And the thing is. Fell out. There's a little. Exactly. And is he the one? Is the old woman reading the book? Yeah. It could be dead for a. We know who hasn't moved. There's some bouncers. Sun bounces, I think so. Is that euphemism there always? There's always, Carol. But, uh, yeah, the only time, if I nip out and so I could get out of bed at night, go and get an orange. I've still got to be careful because if they're awake and I open the fridge door. Oh, and the illuminates. Yeah, they'll sort of see the light. And the shadow turn around and the weird, long, stretchy shadow and. What. Why do you get. You haven't got orange juice, orange swash, you know, Robinson's, you can't advertise on. Why don't you take a glass of that to bed? We. Why are you getting up? Yeah. Because whenever I do that, I normally don't wake up and it's a waste in it. The man is a genius. Well, continuing our rocking out thing, we're. In a rock mood. Well, I think this sums up rock and roll, doesn't it? It's not called rock and roll, is it? Textbook. Play. The scientist. Do you think that's about you, Carl? What happened there with all that rubbish? Pressing the wrong thing, going out on that. Don't want to go. You've sorted it now. Doesn't matter. Right? You've come back. You're not focused, Carl. That's what concerns me. Your mind's on other things. I'm all right now, though. You go. Yeah. You sure? Yeah. Okay. This is just. I tell you. I tell you how focused I am. What? Got some new ideas for you. Go. They've all been blinders in the past. Go on. Did you do any competitions when I was away? Did. I think we did, didn't we? Did we give away a DVD? Did we? Yeah, we did. We did, yeah. Go on. Yeah. This isn't like radio, is it, as we know it? This is just people talking. If the mic's on, it's luck. If anyone's listening. I've. You know, I've no idea what they think of this show. It's not a show. Not in the traditional sense, no. Okay, then you're gonna change with that card. The show suggests a certain form of presentation. Yeah. A certain pride. And when we do present, I say it's some planning. Yeah. And when we do, it's ruined by impressing the wrong button. Yeah, but I've got some planning here. Go on, then. What I did was when I was on holiday. Yeah. You said, you know, come up with a new idea. Right? So the best way of coming up with ideas is sort of thinking. Sort of nick in a tv show name and then twisting it a bit. Yeah. So. Or just rip off Simon Mayo's idea completely. That's good advice for anyone out there. Carl is presently running a course right in for tv. And that's the lesson one, isn't it? Just change the title slightly. Yeah, go on. This one I haven't really got. I don't know what to do on the game, but I'm thinking strike it, Ricky. That's all you've got? That's what you've come up with. How long did that take? What is that? I just saw it sound a bit like lucky. Forget that one, then. Yeah, forget that one. Okay, we all have it. Even Spielberg's. Not all his films, you know, can hit the. Go on. Okay, big brother. Yeah. Do I remember? No, go on, big mother. Right. You call in if your mum's ever. You win a CD. What do you mean? How can you. How can you prove that? All right, forget that. Right. Er, here's one. No, er, good one. No, no, the price is right. Remember that? Yeah, yeah. Right. The price is Ricky. No, the rice is right. And what I do, I read from an indian menu and a chinese menu. You tell me whether you have Pilau or egg fried. He's a genius. Any. He really is a modern. Let's go into this one. Let's not cross this off right away. Go on, then. What you read from. What? Well, I've got. I'll get a couple of menus from, like, an indian or a chinese takeaway. Yeah, and I'll go like. Right. Or chicken korma. Well, could I just suggest that as it's an indian, it will be Pilau. And anything you read out, that is. Yeah, but you don't know which one I'm reading from. What the chicken Korma's indian, isn't it? Yeah. So you go Pilau. But then. But then you might as well say indian or chinese. No, because then the name wouldn't work. The rice is right. Okay, yeah, I forgot. You're working for the title backwards, aren't you? Okay, yeah. What day it is a program that they've been in on channel four. Right. Can you cross that out? We're not doing the right is right either. And the rice is right. No, go on. I'll tell you that later. We'll have a game in the office. Right? A game that they've been in on channel four but has got really big viewing figures. Well, obviously not. Do you know 15 to one. Yeah. They're getting rid of that, right? Are they? I'm thinking 15. Taiwan. Get some items that are made in Taiwan, right? Get 15 items and I say what they are and then you go, oh, I bet it's the vase or something. That's one that's made in Taiwan. Yeah. Just explain that again very quickly. No, don't cross it out. Forget that. 15 Taiwan. Right, go on. This is the one that I've prepared for because I think this is my daft. This is good in this here. After that, I'm very excited. Are we gonna play it after that or are we gonna say, no, you can explain now. It's out. I'm very excited. Good to hear that again. It's fantastic. Waiting on a friend by the Rolling Stones. Yeah, go on in, Carl. On XFM 104.9. Ricky Gerais de Merchant Carlton. Go on. Right, this one. Remember blockbusters? Right, this one. This one is good. And we'll do this one. Rock busters. And remember how Bob Oleness used to give you a letter? Yeah. And it'd give you a question. And the answer to that question is that letter. Yes. Right. Well, it works like that. So if I said to you, we'll test it out on you, Steve. Right, welcome to the show on that. Hello. Let's play. Right. And I say, right, your first one is w. And the cryptic clue, because it's done like crosswords, so not quite like blockbusters. Well, this young man prepared for his death and it's a w. So the answer. And it's not always going to be like our sort of music can be any sort of music that's out there. So the w is the name of the answer. I understand that, but is the answer always the band name or is it. It's always the band name, is it? Or the artist? Yeah. And so would the W be the surname or would you have both the initials? If it was someone's name, would Elvis Presley be episode. Don't get annoyed now. These are. These are questions that I knew would be asked. I know this. He tested on me. So you've got to tell them. If it was Elvis, I'd probably do a dewey. No, no, no. Give him the answer. Give him the. Right. Did you hear the clue? No. Give me the clue again. And so that the letter is a cryptic clue. The clues. Fine, listen. And the clue is this young man prepared for his death. This young man prepared for his death. Yeah, young man prepared for his death. And it's a w and it's his first name. That's what he needs. That's the. Yeah, but I don't. Well, shouldn't we have the initials? Wouldn't that make it easier. I mean, they didn't do that on blockbusters, it just had one. If it was a gold run, they often had a foot, three or four. Did they let us? Yeah, well, it was normally just one word. It wouldn't have been a name or something. All right then. W w y. W y. Will young. Excellent. I didn't understand it what you will. Paired for this young man, so he sort of make mixed, sort of cryptic. Yeah, I mean, you know, so should you want to play. Let's play rockbusters. Yeah, rockbusters. How many of these have you got? No, just. Let's just clarify a couple of rules here, Carl. Let's just make sure we thought everything through because I'm pretty sure when they get these things on tv, they at least have a go at them in the office first before they put them straight on there. I'm sure that's how it works. I'm sure Bob Olnis just didn't turn up the first day and he goes up, we're all wing, it'll be fine. Bring the students in, let's have a go. I'm sure they did a bit of. Preparation, so let's just check we've got everything, every base covered. Firstly, how many questions have they got? I tell you what, let's do this off air then. Should we play a great. A great tune? Well, yeah. Well, people need to call in, don't they? Because we're doing it, aren't we? Yeah, it'll be all right. And there's good stuff. I've got CDs, all right, I've got some compilation stuff and a couple of videos and that. So that's what they're playing for. Call up now. Zero 8700, 800 1234. Get them on the aisle, play the game. Brilliant. Yeah, yeah. Is that what we're doing? Bit of the cure, right, that's from. That cure, greatest hits, an extra bonus CD on certain copies and that's an acoustic version of just like heaven. Fantastic. He hasn't thought it through. I know, we've just spent with three, three and a half minutes trying to figure out the rules. Yeah, right, we've got it now. I'm sorry, people are calling, the lines are going mental. Right, so hold on, everybody, what we'll do is we're going to do an ad break which figure out how to play the game. We're going to get two people on there and we're going to play it. So XFM and that. What's going on? The adverts aren't working today. And I don't. I'll have to get an engineering as well. Wait, don't play the adverts. I don't want to play them anyway. Don't play them. It's not awful if it doesn't work. Why do you realize if we were like, live, we'd be heckled off the stage? Right, don't play the adverts. We wouldn't survive in the real world. Sort out. Right. Right. Get people on the air now. Just. No, Rick, calm down. Record, then do something, for Christ sake. Brilliant, Pope. Good news and bad news. Bad news is we have got enough callers to play Carl's game. The good news is we don't have. To pay any more adverts. Yeah, in this show. So if it doesn't work, solid. Right, have you got on the line, Carl? Some. Now, let's just remind ourselves. What's the game? It's rock busters. Okay, now calm down, Carl. I know you're a bit stressed, you've got a lot to do, but don't worry, you just had a holiday. Throw this desk out. Just throw. Let's throw it out and start again. Rick, don't get stressed. Go on in. People. People. People wouldn't think it was us if this show wasn't, you know, half baked and ill formed and generally shoddy. That's what they've grown to love. All right, Sam? Is it sounding all right today? It is just about all right. Cheers. That was worse. We've got. So we got Tim as well. On we. Hi there. All right, Tim? Sound quite similar, lads, could one of you affect an accent or something? Which one's Tim? Yeah, it's me. Okay, which one? Sam. Sam. That's slightly different. And they're not against the clock anyway, are they? So it doesn't really matter. I suppose not. So I think Steve just wanted a bit of variety. Okay, you understand the rule, lads. Can you explain them to us? Right, play it. Okay, hang on, wait, let me. Let me explain, because, I mean, life is too short now. Carl's gonna read out, say, three clues. Yeah? And just. Just shout your own name and answer it. Or shout the answer. Shout your own name then. The answer. If you know it, it's the person who gets the most. Right? Okay. Is that all right? Yeah, yeah. So here we go, then. Okay, then. Shouldn't it be the first of three? Well, yeah, but then he hasn't got enough. It's fine. Right then, here we go. Welcome to the show. Right. First initials St. Right. Is that right? We don't know. Do we? How do we know? Here we go. St. And the cryptic clue is better than the average homeless person. Okay, sorry. I think. Is that a band? Yeah. Is it an old band? Yeah, I think that's one word. All right then. S. S. It's an old seventies band. Better than the average homeless person. Tim. Go trump. Yes. Yeah. Well done. One point. You don't know. You don't understand why it's a super tramp. Oh, the average. Yeah, yeah. Crypt. Yeah. Okay, second one. Come on. Some. You guys. That's actually quite good for Carl. Trust me, Tim. That's. I mean, take that. Take that as a good clue because. Yeah, okay, we won't do this again. Right. The letter is f. That's the next one we're moving on to. And the cryptic clue is the little girl is hungry. What shall we do? The s or f? I've got it. Ready, Sam? Feeder. Yes. One all feeder. He's pulled out. Feed her. Feed her. Yeah. So that's one each. So this is the decider in it. Wait a minute. Well, you said first to three, so. No, it's not, is it? That's what I said. Just do the three clues. New gets the most. Okay, well, we can do that now. So here we go. I love this. This is rubbish. Go on. So here's the last one. The initials are AK. Right. And the cryptic clue is. Exploding pet. Say, shout out your name if you know it. Last orders at the bar, please. Last orders at the bar. Exploding pet. AK. You're tuned to XFM 104.9, car Perkins quiz rockbusters. The format is still available. Highest bidder, please give us a call or you can email Ricky Gervaism dot co dot Uk. Is that a band or a singer? It's. I'll give you a bit more of a clue. It's a pop band. Okay. We won. Tommy kitten. Yes. Oh, this is amazing. Radio. So who was that? The one. That was Sam. Who? It's two one to Sam. So he wins. What does he win, Carl? He wins some CDs and some videos. No, he's got. And obviously now, Sam, if you're ready, take the spot. You're gonna do the gold run. Away you go, Karl. I haven't got anyone. You're a fool. Right, stay on the line. We're giving both some presents. Play a record, folks. I just. Rick, I'm gonna shoot off. Feeder, come back around. He's getting all stressed again. You know, we've only done an hour. I know, it's. I tell you what, this hour to go. I don't know what it seems like to the, you know, the listeners. I say this. I'm not trying to be disrespectful, car, but I think maybe someone else should come in and press the buttons, because I'm not sure you're across it. I don't think you can concentrate on talking and working at the same time. I'm not for you. It seems gutted. No, it's a lot of gone wrong here. I say. I say throw this desk out and get a real one. Well, I think there's a vision. There's a fisher price. When you combine argos, that might be. Yeah, yeah. We got there, but we were stunned because it was secondhand, this one. But this is like the mere space station. I mean, it really is falling apart. Get a new one in. Let's not, you know. Oh, I can't believe it. Get the. I mean, look at that. Look at that. Look at the library. Look. Gap. Look at the gaps in the library. About this, because this isn't. This isn't good. What? Whereas that quiz was. Whereas that was good radio. You can join in and stuff. Why do you rush to do it? I told you before, we should practice these things. Although, to be fair, Steve, I can't. I've got time to do anything, so at least Carl's coming up with stuff. But I don't mind, you know, having a kip outside. Really? What, have you got any other ideas, Carl? Because we're really. You've got another out of it? Have you got anything at all? I've got that feature educating Ricky, which is a bit of a play on words as well. Right. Do you know that. You know the film, Steve? Educating Rita? Yeah. I'll see. We've done. Go on doing that. And I teach Ricky stuff. What do you teach me, Carl? Well, I've got a few different topics. Go on. Do you know, like how you taught me about Hitler and Che Guevara and Winston Churchill? I'm going to come in with topics every week and this week I've got hosts. No, hanging bacon is one of the topics. Say that again. Hanging bacon. Hanging bacon all the time. Francis Bacon. No, all the titles are sort of named to sort of make. Sort of tease you and get you more interested in it. Hanging bacon. Well, you certainly intrigued. What's another title? One hairy chinese kid. No, for that one. If there was a university degree. Yeah, yeah. No, I'm gonna go for hairy chinese kid, I think. Final one. Yeah. Alien gives man a beard. Right. Alien gives man a beard? I am gonna burst. Right, listen, gar, you've gotta tell me right, first, right, let's do it. No, we're not. We're not gonna do it now anyway. What do you mean? We've got to do it now. But, I mean, that's the first interesting thing you said in an hour, okay. That listeners have just been subjected to rubbish and. And mistakes and everything for the last six months. Please, we've got to do alien gives man a beard. What is that? Tell us that. Right, sorry. This is just you telling me something, is it? This feature is you telling me something. Teaching you something? Educating Ricky. So are we playing it now? We're already into this feature. What? Into this feature, are we? Yeah, I suppose we are, yeah. Should there not be a jingle? Yeah, can we have a jingle point, cuz? Look, I come up with ideas and you dismiss them straight away, so I'm not wasting time making stuff. Right, well, okay, let's play. Let's play educating Ricky. Right. Brilliant. Go right. Ding a ling, Lily. Educating Ricky. Right, what we going for, then? Hanging the bacon, airy chinese kid. Alien gives man a bit, I think. Alien gives man a bit. I'd like to do that. Right. There's this fellow, I think it happened in America, and he saw a bright light in the sky and he stood there. This is a true story, is. Yeah. He stood there, yes, because it isn't Steve. And he saw this bright light and it came closer and closer and it was a UFO. Right? Yeah. And he looks at it and it disappeared. Right. And he gets back in his car. He looks in the mirror and he. Looks in the mirror. Yep. He's only got a beard. Yes. Sure it wasn't someone else who got in the car and he was still standing out there? Right? What, and it turned out, yeah, he got home and said to his wife or his girlfriend, it's a bit weird. So I just got out the car to look at a bright light and I got back in the car, grew a beard and she said, never mind, you beard, where have you been for three days? And what had happened is he passed. Out because he was pissed. No, the UFO had taken him for three days. Yeah. He'd only thought that. He'd only looked at it and it went away. Yeah, but what grew a beard because. He hasn't had a shave? Um. Right, okay. I mean, was will Smith or Tommy Jones anything to do with this at all? Did you see this on a video, maybe, and thought it was an educational film? No, it's from a book that some kind person sent in to me here. Can I just ask again? That just. Just again. I'm just throwing this right back at you. Do you think there's any other possible answer here? A man is absent for three days from home. He's grown a beard. It could take to grow a beard. Lest we forget. What if he hadn't actually seen a bright light in the sky? What if he was lying? What if he was lying? He got knocked unconscious. He had a car crash. Just lying? No, just lying. Yeah, he'd been on a bender, getting pissed for three days. That was an excuse to his wife. And they went, what are you gonna. Wait, Dennis, what are you gonna tell your wife? Well, wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. I'm not gonna believe I was out with you lads. Just say you're away for a minute. No, she. No, I wasn't away from it, cuz. The beard. Oh, yeah. It looks like you've been out for three days. Well, we have. That's exactly right. Okay, we gotta cover that then. Alien abduction. Great one. Okay, let's try that. Do you see, that's a little scenario there that could have been played. So when you say educating Ricky, what have I learned from this? Never listen to you again. That's all I've learned so far. Never listen to you. We'll add a little bit more in here right now. What do you mean add a little bit more? We'll add a bit more to this. To this what I'm educating you about. Go on. Right. There's only a law in America that says if you touch a UFO, you're gonna get done. Now, why would they make a rule? I don't know that. You know, like all their rules have. I genuinely do not know what you're talking about. Do you know, like how air. Do you know? I've no idea. Okay, I'm listening to capital of these head. I got. I got foxy on yesterday. Let's. Let's bend that. No way about airy chinese kid. Let's play a tune. Definitely some doors. Yeah, I just thought I'd go back, take it back to the sixties. This is a tune that friend of. Mine said, if you touch UFO, you get done. Soul kitchen. From the doors shumbles. David Bowie, slow burn. Yeah. Quite a. Quite eno trilogy. Yeah. But, yeah, enjoyable. Now, okay, that's stressful. And I think we've got things working now. We've had people coming in and out, just shaking their head, going, shouldn't have bought that desk. But it's all sorted now, I think. And, you know, about 25 minutes for. Them to come down as well, though. Do you feel like we're maybe quite low in the pecking order in the building? Definitely. You know, it's like capital first, capital Gold. They can shoot off to other sort of pirate stations, people's car radios, then they come back here. Oh, dear. Oh. Had a job at Richard. Sounds light fitting was buzzing now, but we've got, um. Thanks for staying. Listening. Um. Right, okay. Educating Ricky. What? We got every chinese kid gone. Right. Yeah. This is the. I didn't want to do this. Well, I wanted to give you three and I gave you one. It was like the alien man gets a beard or whatever. Yeah. And. Which was total rubbish. So this one should be better, maybe. Hey, chinese kid. Right, well, we've talked about airy people in the past. Yeah. You know the little kids who grew up in woods and hung around with wolves and that. Yeah, again, you're confusing it. Yeah. They're not that. There were some people that were born a very hyssop. They were not the people who were brought up with wolves. You just put that together in your Homer Simpson type mind. Right. Well, this is like a sort of. Sort of close to that sort of story. Yeah. But the weird thing is, right, chinese people aren't that hairy as a nation. No, seriously, that's. That's a well known fact. They don't. They don't have that much body hair and stuff. So this little kid who was born over there, he was like, covered in the stuff, was he? And it was only his nose that wasn't hairy. The rest of his body was caked in hair. Right. And his hair sort of. What sort of hair was it? Was it thick hair? No, what I mean is, was it sort of like a pony's mane? So he just looked like an ewok? You know, I mean, just like hanging down sort of straight, dark hair in. The picture, it looked like it grows from his eyebrow, it grows from his eyebrows. Quite thick. And then it just goes all the way over. It was just really long eyebrows that he'd done a comb over. Now it was all over his body and a picture of, like, his back and that. Yeah. And he styled it. He styled it at all. Do you have any quiff or. No, it was just. It was just hanging all over him. Yeah. And they were like, you know, this is a bit weird happening in China where we're not normally that airy. The local press and that were getting him down, calling him monkey boy. And all this and thinking, chinese press. But the doctor. Yeah. Cruel, aren't they? Game shows. That's japanese, isn't it? Yeah. And the doctor said, talking through all. That time where we were just, like, turned around and I still saw he was talking. So anyway, the local press came and see the hairy boy, the monkey boy. They were, like, being tight, taking the mickey out of him. And the doctor said he's only. He's only airy. Said he's a healthy young kid. The only faults he's got is he's got a little bit of eczema and a boil. He said everybody should just treat him the same. And I think he grew up a healthy, healthy kid. Yeah. So that's. That's the. That's. That's the end of the story. That's not a story. Why? Well, I've got nothing. I don't know what to say to that. So someone was. Someone in China was born slightly hairier than the rest, and he was normal, apart from eczema and the boil. That, to me, isn't a story. But if it is, I've got a million. I mean, it's sort of like, bloke from Manchester went a bit bolder than the rest, got a job on radio. They were normal. I mean, there's not a story, is it? Do you know? I mean. All right, um. Hang on, hang on, hold on. He's got the big guns. You're not going to give us hanging bacon, are you? Yeah. Come on, then. Come on, then. Come on. We really. Come on. This is it. No, this is a good one. This is the one. This is a story. Right? Do you know the saying, chewing the fat? Good ones? One of my favorites. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know what it means, talking. Right, well, do you know where it came from? No. Right. What they used to do years ago when people didn't have much money, is. This the same as the bait throwing the baby out of the bath water? No, it's not this. Well, it's not the same saying, but. No, but I mean, is it as wrong as that was? Let me tell you, okay? Like, people go out to work and with the money, did buy food. Oh, yeah. Good system. What? Go on. What do you. What, what do you mean? People got to work and with the. System, if you were quite well off, you might treat your family to some bacon, right? But do you know, like, in these days, if people earn a lot of money, they might buy a nice suit or a car. What are you saying? You're saying, let me get this straight. You're saying that if you go out to work, get money to buy things to. To live, and if you get sort of enough money to live and you've got some leftover, you might treat yourself on like a suit or a car or something. Yeah. Back then. Back then, if you earn money, they'd. Say, this is olden times. Yeah, okay, let's get some bacon in. Right? And what they do, they'd hang it in the kitchen or to show it off. To show it off to all the neighbors and friends. Because if you. If you had hanging bacon, it was like, he's doing all right for himself. Yeah. So they had loads of bacon hanging up and people would come round, right? And whilst they stood in the kitchen talking about whatever they're talking about, you know, it say a bit of Ryan and they rip a little bit of Ryan off and whilst they're having a. Having a chitchat, cheering the chew on the rhine. I think that's probably true. I haven't heard that, but that one to me sounds true. Do you see the difference between that one and. A man was abducted and grew a beard. Can you see the difference in why I accept that story? Different stories for different things. So, see, that's a nice. That's a nice story. If it's true. I don't know. It's true. I mean, but it seems totally possible. Viable. Quite interesting. I won't be quoting that myself until I verified it, but that's, you know, I won't be telling anyone. The bloke got in the car and he had a full face beard. Why is car being towed away? Because it was a quiet road. Was it in the way? Are you filling in the blanks again? That wasn't in the book, was it, that you read? See, that's the thing. Sometimes I think you make up bits of the story as though they were facts. That doesn't seem right. Well, that's all you can do in it. So. So that's educating Ricky. Will we. Brilliant. Do that next. That is brilliant. I did. I mean, I enjoyed that. I learned something from there. I mean, just, just I want to get. I mean, this is all from one book, is it? Yeah. That's an interesting book. Um, with it. With the. I don't know, dwell on it, but with the. With a hairy chinese kid. What did they say about that? What did that? What was the. I mean, was it, what. Once there was born a kid who was slightly more hairy than everyone else. But, yeah, it's all right. He only had a boil. Oh, how did they word it? How did they. How did this capture your imagination? There was. Well, it was a picture that grabbed me, first of all. Sure. And it was like, God, what's up with him? And that's when I read it. Did you see the boy in the xml? Just the hair. No, you see, because his face is like, just under his eyes is sort of nice and smooth, and his nose is sticking out and that's not airy, but the rest of him, it looked like he had the sort of a balaclava on or something. And then. And then I read on, and it's like, this is a hairy kid in China. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. Okay, good. Anything else in there? Because, I mean, I like that. We'll do more of that next week. How is that? Alongside hanging bacon, alien abduction, a hairy chinese kid, and a little interesting fact about the derivation of a phrase. What do you mean? He didn't understand the word of that. I knew the word derivation was gonna call problems. I thought derivation shouldn't have come out. I wasn't disputing Hazel. It's all smug because he's had a phone call that was back, lost cause. Go and tell him why you're all smug. Because Adrian just called up. Yeah. After hearing the story about the chinese kid. Yeah. And he said, yeah, that's true. He said that there was a tv program on it. Yeah, he had a chromosome defect, and it made him airy. And his mom and dad used to have to shave him. That wasn't in the book. But thinking about. That's not a good move anyway, is it? Say that for women, if you get a few hairs on your top lip, don't shave it because it'll grow back thicker and faster. So they should just. What? Let him. You should have just said, well, let's see how bad it gets. But if they. If they went in there straight away as a. If he came out as a baby and a little bit airy, they should have left it for a little bit. But Adrian called up and said, yeah, he was airy. We weren't disputing. There was a chinese kid born slightly hairier than the rest. We were disputing the fact that you didn't actually tell us a story you just told us. What we are disputing is that that man was abducted by three days and grow a beard. That's definitely not true. No. We don't know about you in the fat, but it sounds quite viable. You see, the differences between me and Steve and you, is that what we believe isn't random. Do you know? I mean, it's not random, the thing with it. We don't believe stuff just because it's. Interest, not every other thing we believe and every other thing we don't. We can't believe stuff if it's interesting. Yeah, I know, I know. Yeah. Intriguing. And he said. He said to me on the. Before you got me, he said that Ollie's record. Yeah. And every is my brother. What's that about? Then I went, I don't know. I heard it was about someone who had a disabled brother and it was lifting him in and out of a car or something and someone said, oh, do you want a hand? And he went, now, yeah, he's not heavy, he's my brother, ie. This isn't a burden for me. Yes, right. Yes. Carl, what did you say? Uh, I'd say, no, I'll tell you what he said. He went, that's ridiculous. He was still heavy. And he said, don't turn down help. Which we were talking about that because a new feature we starting about this time every week. Oh, yeah, we start about this time every week. Yeah, yeah, we'll do that. Song's got a good story. Okay, love it. Snappy. Go on. There's loads of songs out there in there with. With songs that you couldn't fade out when you hear them on the radio and that you don't want anyone to talk over the start or the end. Yeah. Because when we did went before with them killing a Georgie by Rod Stewart. Yeah. And I was a bit worried that it might have been a true story because we were, you know, joking about. And he went, oh, you know, that killing of Georgie? He went, I think it is a true story. I went, why? When I listened to it again. And Rod Stewart, the beginning says, this is one of my best friends. So there's loads of songs out there and what I want to do, we want to get the audience involved in this. So if you've got, like a favorite song that's got a really good. If you've got an audience, yeah, go on. And the email in Ricky Gervais co dot UK and they say what the song is now, what would examples be then? Examples. Ones that jumped to mind straight away for me. Elvis in the ghetto. Yeah, good one. Brilliant. Andrew Gold, lonely boy. Absolutely don't know. Eminem, Stan. All right, yeah, yeah, good one. You couldn't fade it out, could you? Because you go, what happened? Yeah. And that's. That's what I'm saying. Not just any sort of pop song that keeps repeating itself and, you know, it's like, it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter if it skips or, you know, I mean, if you turn the radio off. Yeah. But I'm talking about Bernie the fastest. Milk. Yeah. That is a good story. That is a good story. Oh, yeah, that one. Yeah. Ted from Teddington. He drove the baker's van. So what have we got then? We got one. So we're going to kick it off today with Stevie Wonder living just enough for the city. Okay? And just, just. If you are nipping out, maybe you're in the car and you're about to pull up somewhere and get out. What it's all about is a lab who's growing up in, like, America in some rough area, right? And he's trying his best to do well and get a job and everything, but because of where he's from, he's stopping him doing that. It's like how I grew up on an estate in Manchester. I had to leave there and come to London to do all right for myself. Right? And it's his whole family and it's a tale of, like, how, like, how his man works dead hard and works loads of hours, but the kids are always well dressed and cleaned. It doesn't mean just because you haven't got a good job, you let your house run down. I mean, she's looking after it, the sister, you know, she hasn't got new clothes, but they're always clean and her knees are clean. I think it says in one point. Good. Excellent. Clean knees. Always important, so always give it a listen. Brilliant. It's a great track. I think Stevie can do it justice. Like some sort of, like, back in tune to try and pepper up a bit. You have really knocked it to the socks off. Brilliant. I'm looking forward to the cleavage. New feature. What is it called again? The story in that song is really good. It's Stevie Wonder. Go on in, Carl, back, announce that. Sure. It's your choice, that. Right, songs with good stories that you. Can'T fade out, although you can heavily edit them. Yeah, I noticed you didn't. You didn't play the. The full version, which is obviously got the complete story in. You've. You've just played a. I haven't heard the other songs. All I know, within the album version, he gets dated. He gets abducted as well. And he comes back with a big beard. Yeah. And he's covered in hair. No, he goes. He gets arrested and goes to jail. But it's easy. It's just, you know, it's just because he gets picked up because he's black. He hasn't done anything wrong. There's a whole other section. Maybe we should change this section. Know what we'll do, right. Abridged versions of songs. Yeah. No, next week we'll play the second bit and it would like Star wars or something like that. Doves caught by the river on XFM 104.9. Well, it's been a good show, hasn't it? We've been sort of like quite a rock and roll seventies feel to it, mainly the equipment, but we got through it. Carl's been telling us some great insights into his mind, really, but a few laughs, few tears. Bit stressful. What are you telling me in the week about when you went to visit your dad in hospital? Oh, talking about. Yeah, me, when I got back of holiday, my dad was. Was in hospital. I shot back to see him, see how he's getting on. And hospitals are depressing places, aren't they? Yeah. Really like. God, you know. You know, even if you're not that ill, it makes you feel worse. Yeah, because it's really like drugs, you down, these people walking around moaning, you know. You mainly. Yeah, nurses. Yeah. I would like to be paid enough and all that. And I do like. No. Tony Blair, you're listening. Yeah. I don't want to look like a moaning about the people working because they all work really hard. Yeah, but it's just hard, depressing places. High five. Yeah. Right. So I sat there, my dad's getting fed up and. Is that because you're visiting? Just, just. It's quite an active bloke and all of a sudden he's got a slaying bed and, you know, it's like, sit down, stop moving about and all this. So he sat there and there's an old woman in the bed next door, right, and she's. I mean, she's in a bad way anyway. Yeah, right. She must have been. She looked about. I'd say she looked about 98 or something like that. Okay, good. Right. Now, I don't know what was wrong with her, but she was always constantly moaning and you could see that the nurses were trying their best to keep her happy and she wasn't having any of it. And, you know, she was moaning because her hands had gone blue. Well, that is a worry, to be honest. Well, it's not because she's 98. Does that what happens. But why. Why doesn't the doctor. If I was a doctor and I'm. Not one, but no, Carl, don't be modest. Are you a doctor, yes or no? I think he's let it slip. Are you, Karl, are you a doctor? No, listen, look me in the eye, right? This woman had blue hands. Had she seen them? A spacecraft, right? No. God, she had blue arms. Now she's 98. If I was a doctor. No, she's not 98. You said. You said earlier on she looked about 98, so you're making that up. She's just shifted from speculation to absolute facts now. Yeah, yeah, she's 98. It's fact. Now there's a hundred year old woman. Yeah, yeah. Go on, yeah. If I was a doctor, I'd be thinking. You're not, are you? Honestly, how would I calm them? How do I get away with this? I'd be thinking, right, she's 98. She hasn't got long left. Why not just let her be at home and be happy in her own space, you know, and let it. Let her have a nice life, whatever's. Left, because she may hurt herself, she may have falls. Some people have to go in there for their own protection. She might not have immediately. She may not have been dragged in against her will. She may have come to hospital because she was worried. Yeah. Her blue hands. Yeah, yeah. But when I was talking to Ricky, said, oh, what it would have been is probably a bit of. Did you say it's rheumatism? Something nice in my. I mean, a blueness can be through lack of circulation, right? So just. You've got blue Anne's bad circulation. We're going to send you home, we'll give you a Rubik's cube. Play around with that, with your hands. Get the blood, get the blood pumping. And don't worry, I don't say, oh, it's really bad. Just think, she's 98, let have a nice rest of the life. Yeah. But instead she was there. And the annoying thing was, and they do this with a lot of people in hospital, they pump you with drugs, sort out. They don't, you know, there's probably a better guesswork going on, maybe a little. Not as much as you, but go on, right. And because of that, they sort of break wind a lot. So I'm sat there with my dad talking. Drugs do that, Steve, I'm sure if there's a doctor listening or a nurse, they will clarify, right, that if they pump you with all sorts of stuff, it wants to come out, right? So you're sat there having a serious chat. It's a quiet hospital. The woman next door with the blue hands suddenly starts seeping gas, right? Well, I start laughing, because if there's one thing that makes you laugh, it's. Like it's a 98 year old woman with blue eyes. Fine. So you try to hold it in because it's a really quiet hospital and it's. It'd be obvious that we were. That I was laughing at her and I didn't want to be mean, but it's funny. And then it got me talking about me auntie, because me Auntie Nora, she. Same thing, pumped her with loads of drugs. She said, a cabinet next to the bed is like boots. She's got loads of stuff, right, for all sorts of stuff. And, I mean, she's not that old, but she's on loads of stuff, right? She's a bit coked up, if she smoke. She called up my man once. Again. And she said, oh, how you doing? And that's all right. Bit worried, though. My mom said, wow, what's up? Should have been breaking wind. So she goes, well, you know, says, no, but this one is going on and on and on. And she was like. She was. She was like. What? What do you say? Was like passing wind, farting for five minutes. One. One thing. Not like, you know, trumping. And then nothing. Yeah. Continuous. Continuous drone of a fart. Yeah. I don't think she had. How big was she? She must be the size of a barn. No, she's not that big. She's. You know, she's good for age. No, but I mean slim. No, fine. For five minutes. Where's all the gas? Was she circular breathing? Was she sucking it in with her mouth? It was just. I don't know. I don't know that much about it. But she called up my mom about two and a half minutes in. Could you hear two and a half minutes in? Two and a half minutes in. She called me Mama and it went on for a further two and a half minutes. Oh, and she just stayed on the phone, did you. Where was I going? Can you hear that? Well, did she hold the phone next to her arse? Listen to that. She was off the ground trying to. Work a tune deck. She was actually hovering. She was off the ground when they found her. The ambulance, then. The cat's dead. Don't light a match. Don't light that cigarette. Yeah, it's like that advert. The kids come home from school, switch on the light. Yeah. There they see Granny hovering, doing the light on. Be careful if you have an elderly woman at home. Yeah. Drugs make you fart. So that's. That's what I'm saying. You know, just let these people. What are you saying? Oh, what are you saying? I'm saying let people enjoy the life they've got left. No, you're not. You're saying, don't put me in hospital. Leave them at home to die. No, I'm not. Give him a Rubik's cube. Right, and die. That's what he's saying. Yeah. I'll tell you something now, right, Steve? I'll tell you something. I didn't want to do it because it bring the show down, but she did die. Who? The blue handed lady? Yeah. How do you know? Because I said to me, dad, how's the woman next door? She went. She went last night. We've got an old fella in there now, so there you go. So wouldn't have been better to leave her at home where a friends and family can call and speak to her, even nip that round if they want, you know, with a cat, I imagine. No, it's definitely a cat. Now, what wasn't that cat's called, do you imagine? Probably I'm seeing like a big ginger one, so I don't know, something like. I don't know, maybe ginger, whatever. Maybe I had a budgie. But that's what I'm saying. Just let him enjoy his life, because. Dining hospital. I wouldn't like to do it. If I went to the doctors and they said, you don't got long life left, I'd say, well, I'll stay at home. Yeah. And that's. That's the point I'm getting at. Yeah. Right. If you can't do anything for them, let them enjoy the life. Yeah, a Rubik's cube. Right. Well, um. Good backfired. Now let's play the second of the Rolling Stones, trout. I'm gonna try and do this every week. It's a feature called too lazy to go and get another album. Yeah. What about a classic bit of rock and roll? Yeah, I'd love to hear brown sugar. Know this is about Carl. Drugs, maybe. I'll tell you later. Well, stones, brown sugar. Steve thinks I can't tell you what this is about because it's too rude for radio. But you've done it again, haven't you? You've said another call, haven't you? Yeah. Just that drugs do make you have wind. Morphine especially. That's the bad one to have. And that was from a medical student, wasn't it? Yeah, up in Leeds. So cheers for that. Haven't had any calls about the alien abduction funnily enough, no clarification on that so far. You posted, though. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We will let you know. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's it. We got through it with all these mistakes. They've got to get this equipment fixed and gets. They've got to go to HMV Monday and buy about, I'd say, five to 10,000 pounds worth. Definitely, definitely. Get this fixed now. Get this fixed. Definitely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't go on about that. Next week, though, we'll have more educated as a phone. Look. Phone. Yeah, don't worry. Do that. What? Educating Ricky will do the quiz. Rock busters. Do that again. Right. I might not be here if that's the case, Steve. What? What have you got? What? Next week? No, no, I'm just gonna bring some sandwiches. I. Do you notice I was quite quiet for the last 20 minutes? Yeah, just dozed off. Yeah, well, the air conditioning. I'm feeling quite muddy. That doesn't work either. And this is totally serious. I'm not joking. For the. It's. I mean, it's ridiculous, right? A song for the ladies to end with. As ever, sly in the family stone. It's always a favorite if you want me to stay. See you next time. Cheers. Sweet.",
