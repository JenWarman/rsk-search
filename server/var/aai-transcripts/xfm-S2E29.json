  "text": "Beautiful day. You too. To kick off the show, Steve. Absolutely. Ricky Gervais show with Steve Merchant. Hello there. And Claire Sturgis. Hello, boys. Carl's ill. Wow. He's not here. I mean, I never believe people. I think they're always malingering. I never take any days off work. I just think you can drag yourself in unless it's. Unless it's life threatening or. To be fair, Rick, can I just stop you there? It's not so much that you take days off as you'll just suddenly decide around lunchtime that you've overeaten and need to go and lie down, but I. My own cold compress. Yes. I masseuse. I'm iron bar. Yeah. So it's taking days off. Sometimes you take days off as you never actually do a full day's work. Yeah, exactly. I never take that hour and a half off a day. Exactly. XFN 104. So what's the story, Claire? Do you know anything about Carl? Do you know what his illness is? I think he's got this cold virus that's going. He phoned me yesterday. He did sound poorly in his defense. Poorly croaky. I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, I'm not being funny. He better be in hospital to show. To miss this show, flagship show of the week on XFM. And you've been away, aren't you? Two weeks. We had the best off again. My best off. Yeah. That's about the best of the last two weeks. Yeah. Shall we? I mean, we're gonna try and get him on the phone. We're gonna phone him and I want him to really explain himself, because, you know, I think he's malingering, to be honest. Well, he phoned me in the week and he said, steve, don't forget there's a documentary on Friday night about Oliver, the humanzi, the human monkey. He said to me, it's gonna be brilliant. And it wasn't. And it wasn't brilliant. It was. I especially stayed in and watched it. I taped it and watched it afterwards. And I've never seen so much hype and desperation. They kept showing the same clip of this. Definitely this chimpanzee that walked upright, like a lot of chimps can, exactly. Lost its hair. So it was half human because all humans are bald. Yeah. So that's the half human bit. It didn't have hair. I'm sorry. Humans do have hair on their head. The other thing was this. This desperation to go, could it be half chimp? No, it's a chimp that superficially looks less like a chimp than other chimps. So Lee Evans looks a bit like a chimp. Is he half chimp, half human? Yeah. No, he's a human. He looks a bit like a chimp. That's fibulous. Yeah. That's a bit insulting. She just plays the music. Yeah, sorry about that. I'll get back to you on that. Yes. Tick tock, Coldplay and clock on XFM 104.9. Can I tell you a Coldplay coming in a couple of weeks time to a co host Zoe ball show. Right one. Don't ever interrupt me to. Don't tell them about other people's shows. Okay, moving on. Thank you. Please do not mention that there are any other television celebrities on this channel, on this station. We are trying to convince you it's only Ricky. But the interruption was the main thing. Well, we can't get older, Carl, right. We looked. It's got his old number out there. His home number. Yes. Hold on. So we went to the new records. He hasn't even given him this new home number. So somewhat funny going on. He doesn't want to be contacted. He hasn't given me his home number. I've tracked down a friend who's looking at force. That phone might ring any moment. I apologize for that, but why is Carl not available? It's interesting that neither you or I and I like to think of ourselves as being fairly close friends of color. Yeah. We have made him the man he is today. We cannot get in touch with him. In the same way that bloke bought Oliver. Sure. I think that Carl is now ours. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. Well, yeah, exactly. I think very much that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Carl is very much like a humansy. If we look, we're gonna lose contact with him and find him. Five years in a circus in Manchester. Exactly. They're doing experiments on him. Yeah, yeah. We can't figure him out. Yeah, well, he's. There's somewhat wrong. He looks like a human, but it acts like. Because usually humans stand up. Right. Yeah. And Carl likes to walk on all fours whenever he can. Yeah. He's not interested in other human women. He's only interested in apes. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't make sense. Oh, my God. And he's bald. He is bold. Oh, look, this. There's as much evidence for Carl being a human z as Oliver. I think there's more. I think there's more. And. Oh, well, Carl barely walks up. Right. I know. Scared of fire. Yeah, I know. It is interesting, isn't it? Oliver was built, wasn't he? Yeah. I see. I don't know. Why are you looking, Rick? I'm interested to hear what your eyes were kind of uncontrollably drawn towards. No, I didn't say anything. I was just looking at his face. No, I. Sorry, Rick, but if there's something you want to get off your chest. Yeah, and that's. That was the human part of it, then, was it? Being built like that because it's humans? A bit, yeah. Although Carl's is very tiny and hidden behind. And he's got. I've noticed him else as well. He's got a big red arse. That's true, hasn't he? Yeah, yeah. It's all beginning to slot into place. And I've seen him climb up a cabinet and eat a banana as well, just to have a lunch and peel it with his toes. It's all coming together. Right. We're going to track him down because he's malingering. He's definitely. I'll tell you what, he's at home now in the garden, swinging on his tire. He's not ill. I think more truthfully, someone said to me that. I said, carl might be ill. They said, right, are you not going to do the radio show then? Well, that's what annoys me. I mean, that's the biggest problem, is that, let's be honest, we haven't got anything without. All we've got is the hook. People are staying listening because eventually they think we might get through to him at home. Yeah. And there'd be fun on this show to be had touch with Carl. I think we may as well just shoot off and leave Claire to do the show. I've got some great music. Is that not. When you read superhero? Okay, play some great music now. Play tune. Okay. There is a monkey connection calling if you know the answer. Doing their cover version of Pleasant Valley Sunday. That's from this new compilation of those. Remember they brought out a load of seven inches. My favorite day. Yeah, absolutely. And on the bb, on the b side of each one, there was a cover of a different song. Steve. I even played the b side of each one and listened to the song. The connection there that we're talking about was. Of course it was by the monkeys. Indeed. Yeah. They turned up in yesterday's episode, didn't they? A lot of people, I'm sure, won't have seen this documentary. It was on channel five, after all. So I always feel like we should remind people that what we're actually talking about. If we just happen to mention Oliver, a lot of people don't know what that means. Yeah. If we explain that it is the primate version of Carl. Yeah, exactly. Hand, isn't it? Yeah, the ha. Yeah, yeah. But it was. They were on a japanese humans. He was on a japanese tv show with. They were doing experiments on him to find out if he was half human and the monkeys happened to be there. Yeah. Mickey Dillon saying, you know, I'm quite interested to find out because, you know, I'm a monkey. One of brilliantly bizarre. Of course, we. We've been off jetting around the world, Claire. I don't know. I don't want to boast. I'm sure you don't want to boast either. Carl told me you'd been off, you know, off to the states. Yeah. That was the reason we weren't here the last couple of weeks that we went to Los Angeles. It was a little bit of business, a little bit of pleasure. You know. I like to combine the two. It was. We were meeting company about doing the office for America, actually. Redoing it. Yeah, redoing it. Or any of the cast. American actors. American actors do, yeah. The thing was, they were flying us over. It was like the whole business class trip, you know, spending a little bit of money and virgin upper class action. Excellent. It's brilliant. Very good. Definitely get free flights. Definitely, yeah. Richard Branson, lovely bloke and I love. I don't think he owns it anymore. Does he not? But he said he's still a good. What does he own? He must own somewhat. We can get. Oh, does he evolve with Virginia anymore? Wouldn't have thought. What did he do? V two and virgin v. What's right. Virgin V's. Some beauty products. Brilliant. Virgin underwear. Brilliant. Yeah, give us. Give us some of that. But I was going to New York before going on to Los Angeles where all the meetings were just for little. Just meet some friends over in New York. And it's amazing because virgin business class, they pick you up in a sort of chauffeur driven car. They drive you down. There's no. But you don't have to check in. With all the wish in upper class. It's like. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't need to sort of queue up with the great unworthy, washed with screaming kids, with ordinary people. Yeah. Basically they just send your information ahead to the airport and you just drive through a kind of drive through McDonald's style. Check in, they take your bag, they check your passport. Boom. They drop you at the executive lounge where they're, I swear to God, lovely free plums. I had two lovely, juicy free plums in executive. I haven't eaten plums. Forget he forgets the bloke's name. But they had lovely, juicy free plums. All right. That's the sort. That is why. That's the sort of wit that I am capable of. That is why he is playing first class. He meant he made a stuff come through. I changed, I transposed the whole thing. So suddenly he was sucking on a man's testicles who he'd never met before. Exactly. For money. Exactly the sort of things on coach. Is only half true. No money involved. Right. Is why he was being jetted off to America to talk comedy. That is the kind of quality. But it was. It was great. It was a really lovely flight. It was a lovely car, luxury car. And the flight, it was like the advert. I've got those beds that sort of. Just, well, recline so it's almost. And you got anything you want as much. And I saw, like, I was falling asleep and I sort of woke up and one of the heiresses was covering me with a blanket. It was like the advert. Yeah, it was brilliant. The lights came down and says, do. You want a massage? During the flight? He can as much. Drinks. Although you can't drink. You have a drink and then you fall asleep because it's so comfortable. They take the light. I can't believe my luck. So I'm driving down, I get to the airport in my chauffeur driven car, right? I'm sat there, I'm phoning people, my mum and dad. You never believe what I'm off to. Just chauffeur driven car. And I get to the airport and you just hand your passport through the window of this car to this little woman who comes over. And I'm just there, I'm just sort of buzzing the window down, handing it to her, buzzing it back up like, I don't want to talk, check the passport, take my luggage, I don't want to discuss things, you know, who I am. And she hands the passport back through the window. She says, it's expired. I went, you are. What do you mean? She went as expired? I thought I said, it's business class. What can you do? Can you do anything? And she went, no, we can send you to America, but 8 hours later you'll have to just turn around and come back. They won't let you through immigration. I was like, what? Go to Los Angeles and talk about the office and that. And she said, well, it's up to you. So the chauffeur driven car drove me straight to the passport office down in Victoria, which, I have to say, I. Had to go back into town. So I had to go back into town. I didn't get on a plane. I'm wearing my suit because I thought I'd wear the suit so I look like a real player. So I love the fact that he wore suit. I wore a tracksuit because I thought, I don't need to get upgraded. I'm first class. Exactly. I wanted to go on with pants and slippers, but, you know, wasn't that. Why she covered you with a blanket? But. So they told me about down to the power. I don't know if you've had to go down and get your passport changed, but they treat you like you are an illegal immigrant sneaking into the country. I'm wearing a suit. I've got luggage. You know, I'm clearly a dignified kind of guy. That's obvious. I'm speaking with a certain eloquence. I got certain pounds. I'd just been working on it in the car. All right. Okay. And they just. And they said, you've got to come back that night. So I had to come back. I had to get my passport. I had to buy a sandwich. I had enough change for the machine because it was not. It was an absolute nightmare. I ended up. I spent. I began the day in a chauffeur driven car on my way to Los Angeles to discuss business with universal television pictures. And I ended the day on the tube in a suit with my luggage. Stood next to one of the posters advertising this radio show, which was just embarrassing because people kept pointing and staring and laughing. It called me, called me. They said, rick, I've really much like, go on. He went, my passport was quite. I went, oh, so what are you gonna do? He said, I quote, went, I didn't know passports expired. Yeah. I went, what do you mean? I went? He went, we are driving license doesn't. I went, what are you talking about? He said, how old you have to be to know that? He said, he said, when will I know all these things? Yeah, when will I know all these things? Hug you. But, you know, did you know that? Did you genuinely know that your passport. I did, because my passport expired. Because she's alive. Because she's alive in the world. There is so much stuff that I don't know because I don't think I've reached a certain age yet I remember you walking on the street once and you said, there were some roadworks and you said, they're probably doing those roadworks because, I mean, chauffeur driven cars. I put the little window up so they don't talk to me. How are you 28? Are you older? Are you old enough yet to help a long distance lorry driver back into a car park? Definitely not. Are you an idiot? Player record. And I'm also. I've. I'm not old enough yet to be able to say, uh, can I have a pike lark, please? Chief in the pub. I wonder when I get to that. Ages supersonic on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant, Claire Sturgis standing in for Carl. But where is Carl? Where is Carl? So we've failed to get in touch with him at home. Well, he doesn't want to be contacted. He's turned up every phone off. He hasn't given the XFM his new home phone number. He doesn't want to be contacted. I can't believe he's not listening, to be honest. So you think he's listening there? Yeah, he listened. He listened in Manchester. If he's not listening, he's out and about. I mean, has anyone spotted Carl? What's your message to him? Rick? If he's listening, call up. Anything else? More sort of call up or you're fired. Okay. Any bad language you want to use, obviously, you can't really. I can't really say it. What sort of words? I mean the f word would you say? I'd say the f word. I'd call him a twat. Would you use the p word? I'm thinking of? Prick. Prick. Yeah, I definitely use that. Not on air, but I call him a stupid little prick. Would you just say your. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Little. All right, little. You stupid little bag of tits. I'd say. I mean privately. What about the MF for it? Because that's pretty intense. That's pretty hardcore. Do you think that this is not appropriate now? Do you think he's. Do you think that would be too, too extreme? I'm worried if I use that and he was genuinely ill, I'd feel a bit of a c word. Cough. Sure, yeah. I wasn't thinking about it. I mean. I mean, a male bird. Sure. Because we've got in trouble with that before, meaning penis. And we don't mean that. Yeah, we definitely don't mean penis. But if you do, if anyone out there. Sorry about that. It was a discussion about bad language. You weren't actually using it. But if any of you out there do see the little twat game to call XFM immediately. Yeah. And likewise if you're listening, Carl, you cheeky MF. Well, you sexy MF, as Prince one said. Yeah, give us a ring because we'd love to talk to you. Just want to find out. Just calling. We know you're listening. No, Amy. Man, red vines. Brilliant. Lovely track on XFM 104.9. Look at your Steve Merchant. Claire Sturgis in for carl Pilkington little. He hasn't called. He may be really ill. I'm feeling a bit, yeah, how it is either. I mean, do you know what I mean? How ill have you got to be to not be able to make a phone call? Yeah, I got sore bottom and I made it in. Keep talking. I pulled a muscle in the bum. How? I don't know, it really hurts. Have you tried to trace back through the week and figure out what made it? I went to see the osteopath yesterday. He put an elbow in it for half an hour. I cried. Is it. Oh, they've got detachable elbows for their prosthetic elbows. Just hold this elbow in there for 2 hours and. Yeah, yeah. You can take that away though. I won't be needing that elbow for quite a while. We had an email about Oliver the humanzi. For those that didn't watch it, there was a documentary last night about a chimp that was supposedly a human or. Was half human or ever. Yeah. For a week Carl has been saying it's gonna be brilliant. I wish he was here and he's. Not here to discuss it, sadly. But Lee Cranston is, has emailed in and says, I thought the best part of the Oliver program was the guy Vincent pace cat fell at the piano telling how he first met Oliver. Quote, he grabbed his female owner, turned her around and bent her over and went to mount her. I made her an offer to buy him the next day. Vincent was then shown in a very nostalgic mood playing melancholic music. He obviously wanted some monkey action. He really, that's, I mean, it is potentially, you know, we know it's a joke there, but we take, I don't. Take any response for what Lee Cranston says or indeed the fact that he quite, he puts at the end. Did he want to turn Oliver into a gay pansy? Question mark. That's Lee's thoughts and opinions. They don't. He sees the chimp mount a human ago. I've got to have that chimp. I must have that chimpanzee. He was very well in doubt, apparently. I didn't see it myself. It was a big. It was a big chimp. A big half boy. A big half boy. Half chin. Honestly, Juan. On XFM 104.9. Right. I just called Kyle again. I've been calling him all the time, trying to get through to him. Right. He's changed his message. So he is listening. I've got proof. So can you just call the number, Claire? Yeah, right. Call the summer. Now, listen to this. This is really annoying. We should tell you now that this is not an amusing sketch or setup. No. What's happening there, Claire? Not quite. Try that again, Claire. I'm livid. Now. I'm genuinely annoyed. Because you'll see, when you hear the message, you'll realize why. Right, okay. Right. Let's try again. I don't know who he thinks he is now. I'm beginning to wonder if his minor celebrity is going to his head. All this nice write up in Heat magazine. Yeah, it's changed him. Richard Anderson instantly is emailed in. Go on, Dickers. Anderson. It's not only music. Why not? Because I'm a bit stupid. I can't work it out. Can I figure out how? Would you call someone normally? Well, normally I just pick up the phone and dial it. Sure. No, I don't mean no. I mean, but it's like I have a problem getting it through the desk. I tell you what. Can I play an ad break and practice? Pretend this didn't happen? And then it's like having Carl play the ads. I'll get back to you. Better. Snoop. Never. And when did. When did a bit of snoop ever hurt anyone? Steve? Absolutely right. I think. Okay. Carl's away. He pulled the wool over Claire's eyes. There's a few people out there that believed he was ill. I knew he wasn't. In fact, at one point I thought, maybe he is ill. His message on his answer machine has changed in the last five minutes and listen to it. And this is evidence that he's not ill. Right. Okay. Yeah. Who don't. We don't. Anderson. Richard Anderson, I should just say, has got in touch. Here we go. I can do it. Just tell. This is ludicrous. Yeah. So, obviously, Richard Anderson. He said he's human in his thoughts. Dicky Anders. Anders? Yeah. Dick Meister general. And he says there's something making. Have we got it? There's something. He says there's something making strange yelping noises in the thicket at the end of my garden. Shall I go and prod it to see if it's car? I'm not in today, but not well on that. No more rockbusters. I think that's what's affected me, it's got me down a bit. So. Joking. The doctor said I'll, I'll be back swinging on my tire in no time. So. So he was listening. He's clearly listening. So he has was listening because we said about swinging on the same message at any time. Right, Carl, call me. In fact, I'll tell you what, if I. Little game, I would appreciate this. Call me, Carl, or I'm going to give out your number. What's the first five or six digits, Claire? 796-80-7968 okay, phone now, Carl, start calling now. Right, give the next number, Claire, you said give the next number. Make one of this. Because if you want to call. Nine, six, eight. And the first number to be given out is one. He's not ill, is. How do you feel now, Claire? Because he's made a fool of you. Because you believe last night, but now past our. I feel a little bit let down. Right, okay, so we give a number out every five minutes until Kyle calls because we know he's listening now. He's having. He's taking the piss. He's not ill, obviously, you can hear that. He could if that was as long as a link. So he could have been here, he could definitely call. Are we leaving this message? This a message we're still leaving on his phone? Yeah, yeah. Good, good. Yeah. We leave the rest of the show on his phone. Yes. Leave it through it all so he can delete it. Yeah, exactly. And the other thing, of course, is that he's not gonna get paid for this. No. So he. So he's thrown away 80 quid now in Manchester, that's a week's wages. So he's obviously been spoiled for. So for all his mank charm, he's down here, he's living the life of Riley quits nothing. He thinks 80 quid is nothing. Or whether you could be buying what you said you could buy yourself at your own horse. Yeah, yeah. Probably get yourself a deposit on a flat. I thought so. I thought so, yeah. And so, um, you know, or sun lamps, because it's always dark. Yeah. He could go mental up there now, dog. So string. So what? So what's the first few digits we've given out? Oh, 7968. Yeah. And then. And then one. Okay, we give out. We give out. Did you so take that down because we love calling him. Should I have a little bit of feed or something? Let me just tell you what, what Dick has said. He said Richard Anderson. He also said, p's the show. Still rubbish without Carl. Still rubbish. Still rubbish without car. Now, is that a compliment? It's still rubbish without Carl. Which suggests he thought it might be better with. Without Carl. No, I think he means he's equally rubbish. Right. Brilliant changes. Thanks, Dickers. Yeah, that speeder, just the way I'm feeling on XFM 104.9. Ricky Gervais. Steve Merchant class. Well, he's defying me. He's not calling in. We're going to give out his number and he's not calling in. That's even more annoying. What do you think he is? I don't know who he thinks he is. I tell you what, I'll tell you who he is. He is a little bold man, Cuny. Let's never forget that. I don't know who he thinks he is, but there's the fact. Just Carl call in because you're annoying me. And Steve, he's been slacking you off as well. Steve, well, gone was in the week, you know. He was slacking you off. I mean, in the week I was joining in and laughing along, but now I'm thinking I'm gonna. I'm gonna know, but now I'm thinking that you're more on my side than he is. Thanks very much, Rick. I'm glad to see you come round. He was. I was in the, in the pub with him and Johnny. All right, so little audience. Good. And he said. He went, oh. He went, have you seen men in black, too? I went, no. He said, have you? Johnny went, no. He went, oh, there's, there's a thing in it that looks just like Steve. And I went, what? He went, it's a thing. He's got really gangly arms and, and bulbous eyes, and it just works really fast in the aliens registration thing. And I went, oh. I said, we'll bring that up Saturday since he's not here, you know. What do you think that. Well, I. I. The reason is, I think the problem I have with is this, that if, if I was to say things like that about Carl, I destroy him. He'd be a broken man after I finished with him. Calling Carl or Steve's gonna say a few things about you. I'm gonna get a couple of home truths out there. I can't believe it. I cannot believe it. Yeah, we haven't. We were, you know, at the time I was joining it. We have been slagging you off on other things as well. But now I'm thinking maybe I. Maybe you were wrong. Maybe I was. Yeah. Maybe I was taking the Mickey out the wrong person behind their back. Because the night from Patti Smith, co written, of course, with Bruce Springsteen. Oh, it was a co wrote, was it? I thought we were. Oh, wow. There you go. Learning something. Learning someone. XFM 104.9 rickety by Steve Merchant. Claire Sturges. No, Carl. Well, Carl's annoyed me. He's not playing. He's not ill. Another digit from the number. Yeah, just do one more digit, Claire. You serious? Yeah, yeah. Five. Five. So one five. Okay, great. We just keep doing that. But I'll tell you what the best revenge is living well indeed. Why don't we just do a brilliant remaining 50 minutes of show, okay, and show the people that we don't need Carl. High five. Okay. You don't need Carl. Right, let's go. Starting out some brilliant. Some brilliant stuff. Oh, you're gonna say so much. Yeah. No, I remember when I was growing up in Manchester. Funny to me, I tell you. Xs one 2.9. I said, no, I saw a weird thing. I saw, you know, um, wearing Leicester Square. I was coming through trying. I saw a hairy chinese kid. No, it was weird because they're not usually airy, are they? E. Did I tell ye about me Auntie Florida? E by ek as like, did I tell thee about me Auntie Flora who shatterself for 3 hours once? Did I tell you? Oh, I don't. Oh, there was a woman born. You have to phone us. Nothing. Oh, God, he's so annoying. That's the new one from blur. Out of time. Only three now. Probably had a sort of car equivalent who sort of thought, well, I can't. I can't bother Graham Cox. And they're probably home listening to that. Exactly. Playing guitar. And they were. You, you could play along. You went, no meal. Yeah. Oh, meal. Come on, Graham. Just. If you're flying. I can hear you playing guitar now. No, no, I'm ill. Yeah. Have they replaced Coxon? No. They haven't replaced him? No. All right, well, they probably will do when they go on tour, but I. Think they are playing guitar. I don't know. That's true enough. You're pretty hot if you want someone to actually see. In answer to your question for the live dates, it's one of the blokes from the verve. Did she interrupt me again? I think so. I'm a fear in it. God, I can't think. You know, I might be mental, but I think I was talking. Claire, when's your radio show on? Normally, when do you host a radio show? Am I allowed to plug it? Monday to Thursday. 09:00 p.m. Maybe we should come along. And start talking over you. I was just wondering, Rick, I'm just wondering who's listening at that time. I mean, what, we've got a prime time, which everyone is sat at home listening on a Saturday afternoon. Claire. Yes. One of the best radio slots. Matches or shopping or anything like that. I want a piece of the action. I need it. Yes. I mean, well, you've got it. And they're playing a few dates here, and they're all blur El Blair. Good. And that's off their new album, probably with all the other songs. Rick, I was watching tv last night. I just might have been during the monkey show, actually. I'm not sure. But there is an advert, and it reminded me of a little crush that I just thought I should express. Because I wonder if, you know, I've often used the platform in the past. Just express my feelings for people. Yeah. And I've. I realized now, for many, many years, I've had a big crush on the scottish widow from the scottish widow adverts. She's. I just. I just want to say to her, you know, is it because she's sort. Of mysterious and hooded? Partly that. It's also because I know. I guarantee she's available because she's just lost. She's a widow. Yeah. And I just think it's time to stop grieving. I think you've been grieving too long. I think I want to say to her, you're a beautiful lady. That's not. She's probably. She's probably got big lumps done. I'm thinking she's probably got a sizable amount of cash. Yeah. She's obviously got a lot of spare time on her hands, not working or raising kids because she's wandering across the moorlands. Yeah. Kids are probably grown up. I'm thinking it's time, or they turn to crack or something, but I'm just saying this. I think it's just time to say yes. He was a great man. He was a good man. He was a lovely guy. He worked on. It's time to move on. He would want to see you like this. Still grieving after 25 years. No, he'd want. He'd want to see her being humped by a big lanky thing with steamed up glasses. I reckon I'll be honest with you. He hasn't got much say in the matter. He's dead. Well, all right, don't get nasty. And frankly, she's still not. She is squandering that money. She could be out. She could be in Europe, she could be in Barbados or Hawaii. She could be spending that cash she could get. She could lose the hooded short and maybe slip into a nice bikini. Do you know what? I think she's kept herself in shape. I reckon she's wearing nothing under that. That's what I was thinking. Dirty slut. And I'm assuming. I'm assuming as she's scottish, that he. Couldn'T wait for him to go. She couldn't wait for the poor bloke to go. He was obviously. I bet he was a little bit thrifty. He's probably got quite a lot stashed away that she's slowly working her way through. Yeah. And I want to find out. I want to find out. Oh, he died. Yeah. I'm. Because if. Because if I find. It's like always. There was a roller skate on the top of the stairs. I'm going to reopen the investigation anyway. Suspicious. Yeah. Yeah. Questions? Your husband's dead. And she went, oh, no. Where's the money? Yeah. Steve merchants outside. Exactly, yeah. Built like a donkey. Yeah. He's built like a chill. Like Oliver the chimpanzee. Yeah. And he wants to get at it. Yes. He's bought his tandem. We're going off to the moors. Yeah. He's gonna fly executive class. Yeah. His passport is valid. I know that. He's got another ten years on the passport. Well, I'll tell you what, the boys from Blair, they don't rock. Sure. Should we share my other rock with a bit of bad company? It's a classic. Turn it up, Claire. Bad company. Can't get enough of your love. I'm in a rock mood. Made my blood boil. Yeah. Really? I might even play a song. You're probably too young. Called spirit of the radio by Rush. It's so rockers, a few of that. It's like the ultimate sort of pomp rock, progressive pop song ever. It's. It's classic. You can. You can. You might hate it or you'll love it or you listen to it ironically. I love it. Well, you know, I. I just. I was listening to led Zeppelin recently. I never really understood the rock phenomenon before, but I just understand it now. It just gets in your blood. It's extraordinary. Crank it up loud. And it is just visceral and amazing. And I wish I could play the guitar. Sure. Do you know what I feel like doing? What? Writing a little sort of him or ballad. About to call to Carl. Yeah, we've tried threatening him. That's not worked. Give out one more digit. We got half hour to go for three digits, so it's. Oh, what is it? Oh, oh, 7968. Yeah. 15. Next digit, please. Okay. One, four, seven. I hope you're making a note of that. You'll be able to phone, call, leave messages, tell him what you think of him. Unless he phones. He can stop this at any time by just simply calling. You can just call and say, okay, don't. He can just call and say, please don't give my number out. And I'll go, as I always do when I'm winding him up and I'm slapping his head and I'm sort of like spitting on him and stuff. Eventually he goes, shout, stop it. And I go, we only have to ask. Exactly. So if he calls, I go, you only have to ask. Flaming lips on XFM 104.9. What? We got through it without Carl? I think so, yeah. I've enjoyed myself. Didn't mention him much of it. No, I don't think so. Don't think we need him. I always quite enjoy it when he's absent, actually. I know. Yeah. Because we can have a nice chat as opposed to just going. Remember when I had chinese air and there were old woman eating her own legs? A forest gump in a wheelie bin? Yeah. Yeah. Claire brings a certain kind of level of class to it, dare I say that. You know, she. She's inept in her own way. In her own way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, there's no way. There's no one any good working. There's no, like, proper. The only proper dj is probably Canfield, I'd have thought. Because he's been. Is nearly 13 now, and he's been there. He's been in the radio twelve and a half years. Yeah. See, he took. They tested him and he's half human, half Vance. Yeah. Which is. Which is quite. Yeah, he's got quite a lot of. I think he's got the 48 chromosomes. Yeah. Tommy Vance has got. Yeah. Yeah. That makes one Tommy Vance. Yeah. And a little bit extra. Yeah. Because one of those chromosomes is pure Jack Daniels. Yeah. Jack Daniels chromosome. Exactly. To a Daniel. There's some lemmy jeans I think you'll find in there as well. There. But. Although I'll tell you what, I share with Canfield, a couple of loves I agree that one of the greatest programs of all time is Colombo. Columbo is brilliant. It is amazing. Yeah. And they're showing them all. There's so many channels showing them now. I think Granada plus, show them. I think BBC show them. I think everyone's got a big 18,000 episodes, apparently, still making them there. No, they did in the nineties. They're not quite as good, but I think the original ones, they're great. He's got this great character and I share that with him. You know, I do like a bit of rock. Should we play rush? Just spirit of the radio. I mean, we get. We get canned by. People do like new metal and blur and that. And those trendy bands, all that. The kids bands and that. But you think this is pure. Yeah. I don't think this would feature in x ray magazine. They've got some great bands in them. They've got kalup, they've got depth. They got flap nibble coming out with a new single. It's an ep. And strep early. Not the latest rep, the early strep, the unrecorded years, which is the only ones I like by strep. And that guy in it, you know that the drummer, kibble, he's gone. He's got his own scone, fringe. He's in for a chat with Christian on the breakfast show where you could win a trip to O'Neill's in Camden. This is Rush. Rush and spirit of the radio. Everything in that. Let's look quick. Let's put everything type of music. Okay. Go to reggae, interrogator. Opera. Opera. Go mental now. Go mental on the drums. Double that, double the foot. How many. How many bass drums have you got? Just to what? Go mental on it. Right. Everything in that, isn't it? How long is four and a half minutes? Yeah, yeah. It's crazy. That's. That's. People don't play music like that. That's. Oh, there's only three of them. I just think. Yeah, that's that. And just one day in Canada. Yeah, they just went, right. We might. Let's make. We're only like one single. Yeah. So let's put every type of music into that single. It's almost like a stars on 45. Yeah. Version of music. Exactly. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I have no idea. But that was for Canfield. There was bad company there in rush for Canfield. Colombo. That was for Canfield as well. The A team. Do you remember once when we were talking about the A team. And I was slagging it off on your show in the old XFM. I was going, I mean that I quite like the A Team but it is too, it's, sometimes it's too far fetched to enjoy without it being ironic or it being for kids. And I could hear fuming from outside, I could feel him going, he didn't know who to call. He wanted to call Vance or someone or Lemme didn't know. Right. And then I, I said, and if you can't find it, you know, find the A team. They outwit the might of the FBI every single week. But an old woman who's having trouble with her landlord can find them. And the door burst open and Campfield went, that is because Hannibal sometimes disguises himself as an elderly chinaman. And that was his explanation for the whole series. Yeah, that was for Canfield. That's lovely. That's for his 12th birthday which is coming. Oh he's 13. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh he's gonna, he's gonna rock Steve. Indeed. All the phones going, play that break a lance. Oh, it might be cold. 104.9 in London. XFM. Well here's a bit of a turn up for the books. Carl Pilkington on the line. Yeah. Where you've been. Right, okay. What's the matter with you? Just um, bit bonged up and that got the shakes. Got that sort of, that shaky thing again. Yeah, that's because you didn't eat last time when Suzanne was at work. Yeah well I think that's what brought on. Plus she was away in the week and I put some wet jeans on and that's, I think that's what's called the problem. Where did you put them? On your head? No, they were just on the maiden and the legs felt dry. But just on the what? On the what? I got the maiden. What was she doing there? What do you mean on the maiden? That you put clothes on. What? Your clothes horse. Well, yeah. Right. Okay. So you put wet jeans on. Yeah, that's why I'm ill on that. Having a good time in watching the football. So you just sitting at home watching Teddy where you could have been sitting here? Well it would have been better off there because I've got a chair there. Chair at home at the moment. Why last week, why did you sell a chair? Well you only have one chair. What? Look, can't we just, I just was calling up to let you know I was alright and that. We're not interested in that. We want to know about the chair. I sold it. I had a little two seater and sold it because I'm getting a new one, but I've got to wait another month. So you've got to sit on the floor. So you sold a chair before you had another one. She might not wanted to buy it in a month or something, so I got rid of it whilst I could. She was. Alright, buddy, we'll talk about that next week. Are you gonna be in next week? I look forward to that then. That's a dynamite piece of radio to tune in for the day. Car sold a chair. Brilliant. But why did you take this long to call? We asked you to call since the very beginning. We've been phoning you. Why is your phone. I heard the beginning. I heard the beginning of the show, thought, yeah, it's going all right. Did air and stuff. Turned it off. I put a tape in, though, because even though I'm ill, I'm still showing an interest in it. Well, you know, if you're watching football and shaking. Yeah, well, I'll listen back to it later. So I hope you haven't been dissing me. No, definitely not. Don't listen back to. It's not worth it. But we haven't been dissing, you know. No, I've just been watching football. Right. Did you watch the monkey program last night? You told us to watch the monkey program. We all stayed and watched a monkey program. All right. What rubbish. Wasn't it? Obviously. Obviously not. Half chimp, half human. Well, I mean, they missed out a lot of the interesting bits. They didn't have any interesting bits. Those are bits that you made up to make it more interesting. I told you about. About three months ago before they decided to make the program. Yeah. What were the bits that you came up with? Well, they missed out the bits about, you know, the zookeeper. Well, there wasn't a zookeeper. Go on. Well, it was, but they left that bit out. Well, okay, fine. And they let. They left out the bit where it ran from there in 1975. It's those that did research. They actually went and filmed it. You read it on the Internet. Yeah, yeah. Czar, you're the one with the facts wrong. Yeah, they. I think they also left out the bit when it jumped over three double decker buses on a. Yeah. Evil Knievels motorbike. Yeah. So. I can't believe it. I cannot believe it. Not only do you not bother turning up, but you turn off the radio and start watching football. Yeah, I've recorded it. I'll listen back later. And what good is that so? I like to keep, you know, keep it in shape and that. Another word next week, all right? If you receive any phone calls from people you don't know, we don't know anything about that instantly. We don't know why. Why that is happening. That is just going to be a weird, spooky thing. So. And don't bother telling the story about men in black. Two either, because I don't think people to be interested actually, on the subject. Of men in black. What? Have you seen that, Steve? No, I haven't, Karl. Tell me about it. You should see it. Go on. Why? Because there's this thing in it. Go on. What a stupid, bold, mancunian tosser. No, weirder than that. There isn't anything weirder than that. It was gangly. Keep talking. You've got to see it because you wouldn't believe out the likeness. And that's. Ah, right. Not as weird how the normal voice. Right. I'll tell you what, mate, ain't worth coming in next week. Oh, stay on the line, Carl. Play a record player. Kings of Leon, Molly's chambers. What do you think of that car? There's a surprise. Oh, another remark. Steve is not fan. Now you. Not only does he know you've been slagging him off behind his back. I wasn't slugged. Steve, if you get it out on the DVD tonight, you'll know I'm not slugging you off. It could be your brother. I love the fact that it makes it worse. He's think you're going to go, oh, he wasn't. Lucky me off. It does look like me. I do think I'm an alien. I love the fact that you hope Steve will go. He's got a point. It's that it's. No, it's a spitting image. Yeah. I am seriously a Carl. I mean really angry. I'm so angry with you. You haven't seen it yet. No, I know because I know what it's gonna be and I'm just. Why? I'm angry because he doesn't do it in jest. What do you think it's gonna look like? What do you think this thing's gonna look like? Gonna look ludicrous. It's not gonna look anything like me, but he's gonna pretend it does. Go on. What? Go on. No, it does look like you. Yeah, of course it does. And you look like the human Z. Well, I mean, to be honest, you did a bit, Carl. You walk like him, you bowled like him. You got a sort of gormless face. Like him anymore. I don't smoke. That does arguing with you. I'm not well on that. Oh, you're not well? What exactly is wrong with you, you wincher? Well, it's just, you know, like I always tell you about the restless leg syndrome I've got. It's, like, all over. So you're just shaking around the house? I'm just. Yeah. What do you look like, Elvis? What are you doing? You're shaking around the house with your bald head. You probably like an enormous vibrator. That's what you probably look like if you shoot naked. Oh, you'll have a scottish widow coming round. Oh, dear. That's. What's the name, by the way? I heard you talking about that. That's Amanda Lamb. Amanda Lam. Who's in the place in the sun program. Is she actually a widow? Is she a scottish widow. Man? My husband's dead, dear. Want any money? And a bit of mclam. Brilliant. All right. That's the sort of quality you've missed out on today. Well, anyway, you gonna be back next week? I get. We need you back next week. Yeah, well, do you know, that's also. How did you know you were gonna be ill today? Because you phoned and arranged this yesterday, conveniently. And I spoke to yesterday and you didn't sound very ill. I felt ropey yesterday. You've got a bit of a bunged up nose. I still sorted it out. I'm a little bit sweaty. Sorting out does not mean you phone up Sturgis and send her down. That's not sorting it out, that's making things worse. Have you learned nothing? Thanks, Claire. If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. Yeah, I'm a little. My legs a little bit achy. Wearing wet jeans. Oh, I put wet jeans on again. Lasagna wasn't. It was frozen. Can you hear the venom and hatred in our. In our voices today? We genuinely are upset and angry with you. Yeah. Can't believe it. I cannot believe that you. I mean. Oh, right. Well, the thing is, we'll be back to normal next week, right? We've got Billy Elliot doing the film next week. Right? Any prizes? Got some good stuff. Have you got any films with Burt Reynolds in to give away on VHS? Well, I'll see you then. Great. We're looking forward to it already. I'll see you later. See you later. Hot, hot, heat. Bandages, XFM. We're off in it. That's it. It's all over. Yeah, about next week. Yeah. Thanks, Claire. Bye. Total respect. Keep it real. See ya. Xfm.",
