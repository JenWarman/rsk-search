Just going. Because it's just too. That's all that I'm Ricky Gervais. With me, Steven Merchant and Karl Pilgrim too. I mean, get to the music. So it's, hi, I'm Ricky Gervais. This is XFM. Sure. Here's radiohead. Somebody come out. That was radio and XFM. I'm Ricky Gervais. Tony Blair. What's he all about? Yeah yeah yeah. That sort of Snapchat. Cause I quite on a serious note and you've always been saying it. I listened to an old show. Cause when Kyle was compiling those things, I listened to an old show and I listened to me. And I'm really concentrating now because I sounded like the most inarticulate, brain damaged old drunk I have ever heard, given a show. I mean, I was shocked. Not finishing sentences, leaving out words, slurring, just doing noises that you understand because you know me. So I'm really gonna make an effort for the listener. Yeah. It's not gonna happen, is it? You're gonna give up after. I thought you were joking and I thought it was like always taking it there. Did it. Then again, I don't quite know what that sentence meant. No. But of course I've got also your body language and your facial gestures. But obviously the listeners have got nothing else. They've just got the voice. They've just got the voice for it. That's all they've got. That's all they can rely on. Yeah. And when Karl Pilkington is the man holding the show together, when he's quite damning. Exactly. Exactly. How did I come across? You came across as lovely. I mean, I did an interview yesterday, right. And I was trying to describe you to this journalist and I was going, it's like a cat can talk. Because the things you say. I just want to know what your world is. You know, when a cat comes in, you go, where have you been? And it looks as you're like, you know, you could. It can nearly understand you. And you, I wonder. I'd love to know what that cat thinks. And with you it's almost like we've got one. Yeah. Yeah. Did you like that? You can also lick your own testicles, I think. Doves caught by the river on XFM 104.9. You're listening to Ricky Gervais. Welcome. I hope you're having a lovely Saturday. Were you asked to appear on Celebrity Fat Club? No. No. Was that seriously did an invite? No. I don't know. I knew about it and I was waiting for the call and I was going to be insulted, but it didn't come. How much are you looking forward to it? I'm quite excited about it. I'm excited to know if people know. Are you aware of this car? This is this Celebrity fat club. It's a new one of those reality shows. It's ten celebrities. I think they're all overweight and they've got to lose weight over the course of the series. And they're. And they're celebrities. And they're celebrities. That's what I've called it, that celebrity fat club. So who have they got? Well, I'm very excited because one of them is, you know, that guy who was in pop idol but didn't win in the end, that really big fat guy, Rick Waller. Fats Waller, as I call him. And I was reading about him on the web earlier. Um, it says, uh, he's been told to lose 17 stone because they reckon he might be dead by the age of 40 if he doesn't lose weight. I don't know how old he is. He's only in his twenties, isn't he? Well, that's still a good. But it says, it says, uh, he was shocked to find he weighed 30 1 st when he stepped on the scales at the start of the show. 30 1 st. 30 1 st. But I love the fact. Really big. I like the fact he says he was shocked to find he weighed it. Yeah. I had no intonation. I kept my eye off the ball. Exactly. That must be all those breakfasts. I haven't stood on the scales for years and I didn't know how much I weighed. Rick told the Sun, 30 1 st. Right. That is. That is. That is having a man on your back and carrying a man in your arm. Just two men are going everywhere. It is obscene. Cause he looks. Have you seen him? He looks like one of those people who's wearing one of those inflatable sumo outfits. Yeah. He's just a little head and like a sort of arm. We're not having a go at fat people. I'm having a go at him. Rick. No, because it might be glandular. It's not. It's great. Exactly. You know what? This is true. When I did, I did that room 101, and I did one. They cut out completely. I don't think I'd cut it out on taste. I think it was just too long. And one of the ones I put in was fat people who say it's glandular. Right. And they've done the research and 2% of obese people can claim it's glandular. The rest, they just eat too much. But the thing about Waller is he was going on there, gonna tell you, going, it's good. What a wonderful role model I am for people who don't conform to the usual pop star sort of stereotype. No, you're not a role model for anyone. You are a fat pig of a man. I'm sorry, but you know, Rick, but to be honest with you, it is obscene. It's not his weight that disturbs him. Right? It's his gums. Well, they've been through a lot. Yeah, haven't they? They have been through. The weight does consume me slightly. Did you remember when he did his version of I will always love you? Yeah, but I thought he was just. Singing about like a buffet or something. Yeah, yeah. Outside the chip chop. Yeah. Go away, Mister Waller. Yeah, just, just let me watch the kebab rotate once more. No. Could I lick the fat off the floor? No, you can't. I just imagine those people who run all you can eat buffets, when they hear him coming, they shut the door. One of those 1920s speakeasy. The front changes into like a laundrette. Just move on, fats. It's not. I can smell chip fat. No, no, no, no. Move on. On you go. But, um, I mean, we're not olympic fat Brits. They are fat with a 30 1 st is sort of quite big. But the American, that one, did you see that one? Seriously, we talked about it before, that one on Jerry Springer. And he was 75 stone. Did you see 75 stone bed? Honestly, it looked like a. It looked like a, I don't know, sort of molten lava in his bed. And it was really actually sad. And I was really sad because he was, you know, he was in tears and he was going, this is it, I'm gonna do it. And Jerry Springer took the wall down and they got him that to get him in a special ambulance and everything. But my point is this, right when he got to say 50 stones, didn't he go, that's a lot in it. I gotta be careful for a human. Exactly. You know, for someone that lives on land. Yeah. That is. I tell you what. I mean, the fact is they have to have special weighing equipment. So wasn't that a clue? That must have been the fact that. They had to get in some next door to lift up a bit to tell him how much he weighed. Yeah. The fact that he featured on the ordnance survey map should have been a. Clue that we've given you your own man. Yeah, you are. Yeah. Stop eating. Oh, always amazing to hear that, isn't it, sugar? I can't change your mind tune. I was listening to copper blue, the album from which I was taken. Again, it's just fantastic. Old molding old doe, as I call it. Exactly. Bob, you've got a real problem with Rick wall, haven't you? I just. He turns my stomach. I know, but he's arrogant as well. Explain to people that. No, he is a bit arrogant. It's his whole thing that. It's the whole package, so to speak. You don't. Well, there's another thing in this quote. Because he's not just the fact that he eats too much. He. He tried, apparently, to lose some weight. And it says. He said, the first month I lost eleven pounds, the next I lost a stone. But in the third, my body did somersaults and I put on nine pounds. I had a slip up. I can't say when, why or how, but it just sneaked up on me. Yeah, I don't believe it. Yeah, don't believe it. Just sneaked up on. That body's never done a somersault in its life. No, it just sneaks up on him. Yeah, it was the cakes again. Yeah, it was the same old cakes before sleep eating. Yeah, it's called. It was the KFC bucket again. Family size KFC bucket for breakfast. Poor man. The other thing is that I think that's a very good shock tactic for a doctor to tell a 20 something. Well, to be honest, you've got 20 years to live. Yeah, that's not. When I was 20, the thought of dying at 40 was fine. I didn't want to live to 40. I just thought, oh, what can you do when you're 40? Yeah. Just laying around, doing nothing, eating cheese. And then you got there and you discovered. No, but someone said dreams came true. Sophie here sent me something. She said, I realize you're not Graham Norton, but I had to send you this. And she sent me the top of a little cream. Cheesy thing. It's. The brand name is Gervaise. How God that is. They've named a cheese after you. I think it's a big french company, and this is from the Czech Republic. It's all over Europe. And so that would be a dream. Come true, wouldn't, if they named a cheese? No, I think it's. I think it's probably, you know, ancestors and so I've. Cheese is in my blood. Sure. Quite. It literally is, yeah. Another heavy Friday night, was it? It comes out of pours like those play doh things. I can squeeze out different shapes. Jay, bring the Stilton in. It's Friday night. This is a fry. Exactly. But, yeah, so we can't really have a go at Rick Waller. I eat too much. Yeah, but you're not big. I mean, one of the other contestants on that, on the fat club, celebrity fat club, is. Another one is Jono. Jono Coleman. Oh, we love John. Oh, Jono. I don't know, you know, Jono, he's. That guy does, um, used to be on tv and I think he does a breakfast show on arrival station, doesn't he? He's happy, isn't he? So trippy. And he's a really nice bloke, Jono. But funny because he does a breakfast show on heart, which is wrecking his own. There's a bit of irony. Oh, I love Carl. Thanks, Carl. Do you know what I mean? I can see where you're coming from. Yeah, that's good. But we've met Jono a couple of times. We saw him at a couple of. Not wishing to say, not to show off, but a couple of awards dues. Yeah. That's showing off. Other people would have seen dead there. Well, yeah, but we. We went to one where everyone was in, like, tuxedos or suits and ties. Not Jono. Jono was wearing a pair of Bermuda. Shorts, big Bermuda shorts, wide length Bermuda shorts with just these little. But I saw him again another time and he had shorts on at a similar event and I've seen him since in the street and he's all, I don't think. I'm wondering if he can wear trousers. I don't think he can actually wear trousers. I don't know if there's a medical reason for that. Whether he's just. His legs are too fat. I think the material is a waste of money. I think it's just that you can get shorts that big and they're comfortable and, you know, I mean, to be quite honest, I don't want to squeeze into a tuxedo anyway. So if you can go, I'd love to turn those things in. Bermuda shorts. Well, of course, flip flops. Do you think he started off by wearing, maybe just had the upper half as a tuxedo with the tie and then the shorts and the shorts underneath and he would just have to come in to the sneak behind, you know, a sideboard pied plant or a pipe plan or his kids bring his kids ahead of him. Yeah. You know, you aren't. Of course I am. Yeah, kids move a bit. Well, no, of course I'm wearing trousers. And he just thought that, this isn't fooling anyone. So now I'm gonna make a wacky effort to sort of, you know, the. Next stone is, I've heard he's going in a grass skirt and a garland around his. And he's gonna, he's gonna come in limboing. But you, you did ask if you could go to the bathroom in a dressing game, didn't you? Freeze. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Is this talking about diets and stuff? Right, go on. They've come up with a drug that. They tested it out on a mouse, right. They said, you know, it's a problem. Weight is a big issue in the world and, you know, a lot of people are depressed and that. Probably like Rick Waller. Well, I'm depressed looking at Rick Waller. Oh, you know. Oh, I mean, you could sort out Rick by, you know, Jono is an old man. He's got loads of money. It's not old. No, but he's getting on a bit, right. He's about. What I mean is he does his own shopping, right? So I bet it's. Sorry, what do you mean? Because he's like, how old is he? 35. Right. He's got loads of money. He does his own shopping. So when he goes to the supermarket and he passes, you know, the sponge cake section. It must be tough when you've got loads of money to burn that you go, just one more. Yeah, we are getting close to libel here, I think. No, no, no, I'm saying how it is because I have tried, like losing a little bit of weight. Have you? And it is difficult when you, you know, you're in Waitrose and you see a little chocolate muffin and things. One more and I'll do without. Do you like a little chocolate muffin now and again? Yeah. Right. Is that your favorite thing? So the thing. Chocolate and muffin. Let him finish his point. So the thing is, right now with Rick, he lives at home with his mam, so why doesn't his mam just say, I'm gonna buy less this week and if you eat it all, you're not getting any more? Yeah. That's all. Does he live short? Sharp shot. I bet he does. So you don't actually know if this. Is true or not, but anyway, right, so this, this drug they've come up with. They've tested this on mice, haven't they? No. I'm worried if they haven't tested it on mice. Thank God for that. It's definitely been tested on mice. Definitely. They fed a mouse a load of cake. Yeah, right. And it went a little bit chubby and he said, right, stop a minute. And then they gave it. This drug makes you lose weight. Yeah. And its weight went down. But the only bad side effect was its eyes were popping out. Well, that seems. That seems to be fine then. Let's give it to Jono. That doesn't seem to any problem. Yes. Truth. Doc, look at these. Oh, Jesus, Johnny, your eyes are popping out. That happened to the mice. Sorry. That happened to the mice. But what do you mean that's the option? What do you mean, that's the option? So. So I love the fact that your choices either be like a fat happy man who has the odd sponge cake or a stick man with eyes on stalks. I mean, Steve's chosen that. All right, calm down. I thought we were slagging off Rick Waller. Sorry, mate. Let's have a go at the fat people before we start on me. Really? Yeah. No, I didn't. I thought. I mean, it's like. Because I've got some issues. Embody issues. I mean, Rick Waller's grotesque, you know? Yeah, sorry, I'm just a little bit weird. I mean. Do you know what I mean? Yes. We play a song and. Well, I'm just a little bit offended. That's upsetting. Vines. Out of the way on XFM 104.9. You're listening to the Ricky Gervais show. With Steve Merchant and. Gotta try and get on, though. No, not enough time, this. Let's bang on. Let's do some observations, some satirical. Take a sideways look at the week's news. Who's the fattest person you know, Carl, is it an issue for you? Are you concerned about fat people? Only if I'm traveling somewhere and there's one sat next to you. Yeah. Annoying. Yeah. I think Ricky pointed out a few months ago when I. When I went away, we were talking about plane journeys and you were saying, oh, it's a bit out of order. And when you go on holiday, right, you take your suitcase with you. I'm a. This is all I saying. This on air, though. Is this my question? Because there's. There's a reason I don't say things. No, no, no, but I think you've got a good point. It made me think. Oh, no, it's what I know what it was. Yeah, yeah. It's sort of like if you're not allowed to carry hand baggage on because you're a few pounds overweight, but there's a bloke behind you who weighs ten stone more than you. Yeah. Surely the whole package should be weighed. Yeah. Like you and your baggage. Absolutely. So I can. So I can take on a Labrador and a wheelbarrow. He can take on a towelette. Yeah, yeah. To wipe brow. It's sweaty, fatty brown. Yeah, no, absolutely, absolutely right. So. And that does wind you up, does it? But I don't. That's the only time. I mean, people can't help it. We don't want to, like, come across as if we're just having a gut. People who have got. But they can help it. This is what we're saying. No, but that's a little bit. But I'm talking about obesity. I'm not talking about people who are overweight or have got a problem with. With eating and so on, I'm talking about people who are obese, because that seems to me to be an indulgence. I mean, I read some statistics, if we're getting serious. It is a problem, isn't it? Because it's an eating disorder. So what. What's. What's terrible is, is laziness and kidding yourself. But the people who have genuinely got a problem. But it's a genuine concern for, apparently, for the future of our children. Apparently. It genuinely is. Apparently it costs. I was reading some statistic that it costs something like America. It cost them like $119 billion a year or something. But that's not what. People are starving because fat people are eating all the food. I'm not saying starving because of fat people. Oh, you mean. I'm saying it's. No, I'm saying it's a concern. We soon have kids and they're hungry because next door that all the food. I just mean, apparently because exercise, now people aren't taking up exercise, kids aren't taking up size, that we will all be obese in years to go. Not all obese, but it'll be a big obesity. Well, it's the natural state for the mammoths. We crave fat. We literally crave fat for hard times. But now. But now there are no. You're all saying offices taken away. Our body hasn't evolved to take our social input in, so we still act like mammals and we eat and we crave it and we like to store fat. Yeah, that's why we have to go jogging, because we don't, we don't hunt. We don't do anything. So it's not really there for you. I mean, it is about willpower and sort of like, you know, self hate. But in years to come, we'll have just pictures. Like kids will just have pictures of. They won't have nsync on the. Will it be like sumo wrestlers? Oh, you know, sumo wrestlers. I saw this thing about sumo wrestlers because they're athletes. They go into this thing because it's a big honor to be a sumo. Yeah, absolutely true. So you'd go along and you. Nine stone. And they have doctors there, so you have to eat to get big, right? And this doctor was interviewed, his doctor is going, you know, you'd think it's against the hippocratic oath, but whereas they do it anyway, I do it healthily. So he sells them, he gives them diets of like, you know, ten pounds of rice, nine pounds of fish and things like that. And they get now, because it's such an honor, it's almost a spiritual thing to be a great sumo and all that. They have apprenticeship willing to know, you know, like when you're apprentice, say, um, uh, runner or something, you have to make the coffee. And when you're working an apprentice in the studio, you have to clean the floor and stuff. Do you know apprentice Sumo's job is. An apprentice sumo gone? They wipe the sumo wrestlers ass because they can't reach. They literally can't reach. Rubbish. Right? Who's taking that up as a profession? I know. I imagine that I'd, I'd, I'd love to be a sum arrest. It's a great honor and I'd love to work under you. Sure. So sure. So what will I do? Starts press ups first. There'll be some press ups, yeah. Okay. The gym now. And, no, don't. Before you rush on. Go on. I'm starving. I can understand that. Would you mind wiping my arse? Just can't reach. No. God, no. I can't get the arms back there. Can't get them there. So I'll be honest with you. A lot of this oriental food, it doesn't sit well with me. It goes straight through me to, it's quite, it's quite messy down there. It's quite runny. So be careful. Okay. You might wear some gloves if you want to. Wear gloves where? I don't want to wear gloves. I don't want to wear gloves. It's a long apprenticeship. It's two years, isn't it? You know, you're not going to take my PCs and sallow, are you? As souvenirs as. I mainly getting fat myself. Sure. Wiping your ass. Yeah. Great honor. Yeah. If someone call in and verify that. Look, Carl. Look at Carl looking at us like we've just said the worst thing ever. This is true. Makes your eyes pop out and put in Forrest Gump in a wheelie bin. Don't look at us like that. This is a. We're talking cultural science about here. And wiping asses. Yeah. So, player record. Yeah, it's lowbrow, and it's highbrow at the same time, Carl. That's an incredible picture, Mitchell. Oh, yeah. This is for all you people who like the odd cake. This is Bowie and sweet thing. Do you like that? Nice. Sweet thing. David Bowie. Beautiful. Amazing. Off diamond dogs. Absolutely. We went to see him in the week, didn't we? We did indeed, yeah. This little exclusive, people. Amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Lovely to see him. Yeah, lovely. See him again. Lovely. See. See Dave again. Yeah, yeah. No, he's looking good. He looks great in. He was, yeah. Was he bisexual? I'm sorry, sorry? At the gig. No, no, no. It's just a fact because I know he's married now, isn't he? With a kid and stuff. Yeah, but there was some. There was some sort, I think I possibly. I don't know. I wouldn't want to. These pop stars, they dabble with anything, don't they? I suppose. Try anything once, don't they, these rock and roll stars. But, um. Yeah. So, uh, if anyone knows the, uh. The truth behind. How does sumo begin? Because that's why I can't. I've never understood how it began as a. As a. As a sport. Because it's. Do you know what I mean? Because you are. They are so huge. Well, I reckon. I reckon it was a fat bloke who was picking on a little skinny bloke, and the skinny bloke knew kung fu engine. So he goes, right, let's fight in the fact there's no punching. Yeah. What do you mean? He went? It's just leaning against each other. Yeah. Well, you're bound to win. Right, I've won. He went, okay. Yeah. And that's how it started. And he grabbed him. Are you. Are you wearing a nappy? Well, I am pretty big. Yeah. I'm having problems now. I can't wait. I can't wear a tuxedo. I just can't. Exactly. I just. You know, that's the next step for. John has been banned wearing a thong in public. Seriously, if anyone knows how sumo began? I'm genuinely interested. Email, maybe. Ricky GervaisFm dot co dot uk, you know. Carl, what are your thoughts? Where do you think. Where do you think it began? Because it's. Don't you think it's an old sport? I mean, it is a weird. Always got nice hair. They seem to care about the hair a bit. Sure. So he's nicely pinned back. Yeah. Are you ever asked when people are doing, like, you know, Sharma's Britain, or, you know, people are doing, like, big historical things, they say, well, last car about this. He might. He might have an opinion. Yeah. I'd like to see you as a pundit, definitely. On those kind of news night. Yes. I think it's a funny one, because the whole idea of sport is to keep fit. Yeah. And that's sort of, you know, it's a bit of an odd one in it. Well, it's the same as sort of, like, weightlifting. You have to go through all that all year to see if you can push up, you know, something heavier than someone else, but you have to walk round in a golf buggy to, you know, that one. Yeah, yeah. And take steroids and. I mean, look, I mean, the other day, you know, I don't do much sport. I think, living in London, there's not that many areas you can go and actually, I'm probably wrong there. Well, there's all the gyms and sports. Clubs, but look how excited I was going around to your place, Ricky. I like a little garden. Yeah, I haven't got a garden. We played football, didn't we? We had a look. Well, I did. No, you were rubbish. I beat you in penalties and five two. And then I beat you on knockout, I think, ten four. And he always makes an excuse. He goes, no, start again. We didn't say that. I'm cracking up. So, have you seen Ricky play football? No, I've not really seen either. It's not football. You sort of do it like. It's like when you get a cat and you chuck it some wool, you sort of jump on it and lie on top of it so you can't get it and then sort of kick it with his feet lying on the floor. What I mean is, he fouled me and I still. I was on one show. He didn't just collapse because of all the stress and the exercise. That's the other thing. That's the other thing. He just tumbled off the floor. Stilton poured out of his mouth. I was too strong for him. No, I was too strong for you. Yeah. But you didn't last long, did you? It was like if they just bring. Me on for the first ten minutes. Who suggested that you two play football? Did you suggest this, Rick? Yeah. Yeah. We had to go football in the garden. Yeah. What else do we do? Just look at your salamander. Right. Is that you from Israel? Because I know that when I first went to you, did you used to show your genitals to people a lot more than you do now. You definitely used to do that. You used to think that was hilarious. Yeah. I don't know what it is that you get to a certain age. Men of a certain ilk. Yeah. When Ross came in, he did the same. It's that weird. Yeah, I suppose. I thought, oh, you've seen it. You know, you weren't, you weren't impressed the first time, to be quite honest with you. So, yeah. Always a treat. Yeah. Yeah. What do you make of Ricky's place? What do you reckon it again? That's not a euphemism. Doesn't mean that I've got. It's like a flat fish. Yeah. Do you want to see my flags? Yeah. It'S all right. I mean, I've. You've seen better. I've. The pictures you got on the wall of. I'm not, not keen on the same sort of art as you are. Right. What sort of art? Because yours is quite sort of modern art. He's got this big, like, bit of. Abstract canvas with like, just. Just load the dark colors on it. Yeah. It looks really miserable. Yeah. I'll be honest with you, it sort of brings the place down if you're going to sell it. That woman on channel five, the house doctor, if she came around, she'd say, turn that down, get double for it. It's just, I thought it was like a wall. Take that down, get that salamander out and just pop those back in your trousers. It was like he didn't know what sort of color to use on the wall. So he's like, been putting a little bit on now, that's not good. I'll use like a bit of a darker color. Yeah. It's just loads of different. Are you Brian Sewell? Because you're saying, so what kind of. Art do you like? I'm intrigued. Yeah. I like Athena. I like Lowry, Larry, the worst painter in the world. The most overrated. It depends. You're. You're getting excited about your stuff you've got on Lowry. Right? Yeah, you can look. He really is the Brian and Michael. No, but it's real in it. I mean, it's real. It's real. You look at his picture and you see like little disabled people walking about. You see kids playing with like footballs. You've got your dad coming home from work, working in the factory, got a little dog barking. It's, it's life, right? And you can look at it like ten minutes. Go away. Go and watch telly or something for a bit. Go back to it and you'll see different things in it. You sure that's not a telly? Yeah, you look at the window, Carl. You sure you weren't watching? When the boat comes in, people will agree with me. It's better than your stuff that you buy. This show started off slick. We had so much to say. No, I. What are you talking about? We're now discussing art. We were taking the big out of fat people. And now, and now you've taken it all. Highbrow Carl, player record. We come back to fatties. Badly drawn boy. Something to talk about on XFM 104.9. You're listening to Ricky Gervais. Well, then the Steve mcCain. Let's just get on with a. Had a complaint. Yeah. Someone saying, your tv show so good, why is your radio so hard work, you useless fat. Yeah, so you can't, you can't please everyone, Carl. It's like Larry. Some people like Larry. Some people like that fellow who did the dark painting for me. Talking of emails, there was some guy, I don't, he doesn't mention, or maybe his name's Steve, but he said that he was checking out the office DVD. DVD's going on sale, isn't it? Soon? I think the video, the DVD of the office are going on sale soon. But he was checking out on Amazon and he said that it says on there, and I did check it, double check it, that it includes some special, some special footage on or special frottage, correctly pronounced. Is that mutual? Doing it to each other? Or is it the rubbing up against each other? Yeah, it's one of those is where. You rub up against. I don't know, it's something like that. Yeah. So there's some special frottage on there. Yeah, I think they mean footage. I remember. If you're buying it for frottage, you. Are going to be wanted. Yeah, but we're gonna. That first hour then was about eating too much, wasn't it? I think we can. That's essentially what we talked about. Yeah. You know, read somewhat interesting. You know, they've banned. I used to get the Guinness book records every year from about the age of ten onwards. And I went straight, went to the section like, you know, the biggest, fattest, all that. Right. And there used to be gluttony records, and it was like these ridiculously looking Texans and how many hamburgers they can eat. And of course they were. It's just so dangerous. They've, they've put it down to how many amburgers you can be eat in a minute now. Yeah. And so they brought it down to things like 17. Yeah. They still reverse their stomach as well. But I remember I was watching the big brother when they had to break that record, you know, like eating sweet corn and balancing. I was thinking, who wants to beat that record? Yeah. Most of the records in the Ginsburg rocks exist because no one wants to contest them. There's one in there, bloke, that picture taken with a milk bottle on his head. And it's the record for having a milk bottle on his head. Yeah. And it's like four days go. No one wants to beat that record. And there was one in there. This is amazing. This is absolutely true. Right? Like last year's Ginsburg records. It says in Thailand in 1988, some sort of temple or ceremony, these incense burners fell over and I think crushed people or burned people to death. Seven people died. And it's under the heading worst jostic disaster ever. Do you reckon they're gonna try and beat that one? Oh, God. There's a, there's a guy up north, right, who's. He's only Guinness Booker records for being able to put a, you know, a car, a little mini up his ass on his head. Right. And you think, oh, that's good. But without the engine in. I love that he puts this thing that steals weight, weighs like, you know, 50 stones on his head, and you're going, boom. Yeah. What do you mean he puts the Mini on his head? He, um, he wears a little cap with a little bit of sponge on. They all do up there. And they've. And he picks up this mini case. Yeah, go on. And it takes like, two blokes to put it on his head. And then he walks around for about 10 seconds showing off. But it doesn't have the engine in it. So, I mean, if you're gonna do it. Yeah, go the whole hog is what you're saying. See, what I think, the reason I think he didn't do it with the engine is because he couldn't. Karl. Well, we'll pick. Do a motorbike or something. My mate went to see that? What's that circus that came to London and that was in the Camden and it's all like really weird sort of gothic. Oh, right, yes. And there's a. He said at one point, this nude woman got into a jar. He went, but it was a big job. He said it was a jar big enough for a woman. Yeah, yeah. Get into a jam jar. You know, I'll be applauding, but with some big jar. That's a jar shaped like you. I will get into a wardrobe. Yeah, well, I can get into that. No, you. I will get into the. Well, I remember I told you about this before, Rick. I was devastated. A couple of years, I think was a couple of years ago, and I read about that guy that won the world record for staying underground the longest. What happened? Right? He. He got in this box and he was buried, like, 10ft underground. It was in a pub car park in Manson. And the only way he could communicate. The only way he could communicate was through this tube that they had that went up to the surface and he could talk to people. I assume that was how he got oxygen. And it said that while he was down there. Right. He began and ended a relationship with a woman. She was a passerby, she chatted to him. They start this relationship and they ended it. Right. Now, my point was, obviously, my luck with the ladies is not triumphant and I haven't got a girlfriend or whatever. Exactly. And what I'm saying is, when you read that there is a man 10ft underground pulling women through a tube. Yeah. You've got to sit yourself down, ask yourself some very serious questions. Yeah, I was a little bit, as. You can imagine, a little bit upset. From the midlands. Exactly. Yeah, a little bit devastated. Oh, dear. Really upset me. Do you still. What is your method now of, do you still throw little rocks at them and go over here? Yeah, I, um. There was a killer member at our school, Mark Johnson, when we were like, ten or something, and we were talking about Guinness Booker records and Mark Johnson went, yeah, I'm in the Guinness Book of Records. I thought, I'm intrigued. You're a ten year old. I said, go on. He went, now, I don't. Does this qualify? Does this qualify? He claimed that he was in America once and he went to see a baseball game and supposedly that game was the world record for the number of people in an audience for a baseball game. It was like some massive stadium and this was the most people. And he claims he was there. I don't reckon it was listed. Well, I don't reckon Mark Johnson got. His name on that list. Exactly. Ross McWhort began. But that's the whole book. I think I remember looking up and going, there it is. I was there. Yeah, yeah. I mean I've done a similar thing. There's an ice hockey game in Manchester. Sure. And they filled it. It was the. The arena. Yeah, they had an ice hockey game and I was part of it, but I wouldn't go around bragging. No. Do you know what I mean? Now you've brought it up, I'm telling you. Yeah, sure, yeah, but you're not gonna boast about it. We're gonna get t shirt made. What's the best thing you've ever done? I don't know. Come on, what's the best thing you ever done? That we will go. Did you really do that, Carl? You see, it's weird, cuz I've been thinking about this quite a bit, cuz I'm 30 on Monday. Are you really? Yeah. Oh, you're just gonna try and get presents, aren't you, from the listener? No, but I say listener. Yeah, but I kind of was thinking, have I had a good 30 years? What do you think? I don't know, Carl, is this gonna. Get a bit melancholy now? Yeah, because we've been having a few laughs at the expense of fat people. I'm not sure you want to. We want you to bring it down now. No, we've been having a jolly laugh about people who are morbidly obese. It's always when my girlfriend's working away, I always think about odd things. Do you? Times? Doesn't she leave you shiny things or videos in so you don't get. You don't get too depressed. You can. Well, what, like last night when I sent you that text? That was. Right. Right, let's play a record. This sounds intriguing because I. It's incredible. Right, play a record. Right. What? Wait for this text that Carl sent me. Oh, all along the watchtower there by Jimi Hendrix. Beautiful. Can I just say straight away, Rick, before you carry on, we've had some people emailing in about the origins of sumo wrestling, but they've sort of cut and pasted a huge ream of information from the web. Thanks very much. But we need bullet points or not. Don't bother. You're wasting our time, frankly, with any kind. Too many sentences, proper grammar. We're talking about Ricky Gervais here. Yeah. Not that I'd read the bullet points either. You'd read them too. Exactly, but. Exactly. Your concentration would lapse so quickly, there just needs to be keywords, you know, arse, sumo, things like that. Ass wipe. Yes, correct. Yeah. Or maybe even a picture of someone wiping ass with a tick next to it. If you could get words out, if. You could, maybe if you could send through the origins of sumo wrestling in sort of diagram or sketch form or in a kind of comic book or one of those flick books, you just maybe draw a quick flick book, send that in. But thank you very much. I woke up this morning, yeah. Feeling fine. It's not a blue song. And I turned my phone on and it was from Carl, and it went, forget it, I've made my mind up. And I thought, wow, what is that? And I forget it, I've made my. I went, Carl, what is it? He went, oh, no, it's about the text I sent you last night. I went, well, what was it? I just got this text. He went, ah, I was just wondering. I was thinking last night he said, supposing you had to have your hands removed. Sure, right. And the doctor said, well, you can either have him stay like that with stumps or I can sew feet there. What would you have? And I was bleary eyed and I went, the stumps? He went, yep. I went, all right. He went, yeah. And then what was his follow up text to that? And then I got the text. It was obviously before it. And it went. And it was, like, quite serious. What. What would you do if. Sergeant, would you have stumps or the feet right now? The way when I said he'd made his mind up and I went, the stumps? He went, yeah. I think secretly he decided on the feet, but he's too embarrassed to tell me. There's a little. Little bit of what would you do? Because it's it. But why did you think of this? Why did you think of this? Girlfriend's a way back, right? Yeah. No, that's not why. You start thinking bizarre surgery devices. I'll let you into my little mind, right? Last night I had some beans on toast, right? She was away. It's good already. She was away. She had some beans on. So she went wild. Yeah. Right? Now I was stood up. I live on, like, a high street, right? So I'm washing up, I'm looking out the window. First thing that had me attention is I can. I can look into other people's flats, right? Yeah. And it was weird how all these different lives were going on. I was watching them and everybody had the telly on and was watching volcano, right. Which was on last night, right? And I thought, oh, that's weird, right? I can see them all watching it. And it was like a little chinese lad who was dancing around in some underpants. And then there's a little old woman who lives downstairs who was reading a book, and she's always reading a book every night, and it's like, I have a better life than her. And then there's a. There's like some sort of bounce through. He's getting ready to go out late at night with all the black, and he looks like a bouncer. So I was watching all this life going on. I thought, did you witness a murder while you were doing. Yeah, it was like. It was like that sort of sliver film where that bloke had loads of tellies watching. So that was going on in my mind. And then I was washing up and I picked up the plate and I thought, it's amazing in it, the human body, the way you can just sort of, you know, I want to pick that up. And you do. Yes. And the way your hands work, right, you've got five little digits, but it's just the right amount. To do what? Yeah, to do what you've got to do. Right. So. So I'm washing, cleaning the plate. Sorry, Carl, stop. It's just the right amount might be one of the most genius things I've ever said. I would love David Attenborough to phone you up and say, carl, do I word this about the evolution of the mammalian front limb? Just go. We'll just say it's the right amount. But it is, it is. Why? Cause I would get in the way. Yeah. One less would just make it a little bit more tricky when picking up a bit of a slippery dish or buying gloves. So then I was thinking, imagine, like, going to the doctors and they saying it. Yeah, everything's all right. Your arts good and everything, but. Your arts good. What, your Larry's or. Yeah, you're in good form and whatever. It's good news. You know, I had Jono in earlier. He's not looking good. But you're. You're all right. But your hands need to come off. Right. That's bad. Like, I get a second opinion initially. But a bit of good news. I've got a nice pair of feet I can sort you out with. Yeah. And he puts them on. And then I was thinking, right, first of all, washing up, what would that be like, Steve? That'd be tricky. And then the second thing was, it probably ruin sort of the shape of your jumper. Keep putting the feet with him? Yeah. And then I thought, but I could still cycle in. Okay, you could run in. Well, that's the thing. You'd be really fast. That's what I was thinking. I thought I could still cycle because I could balance. And then I thought, but the only thing is, I probably couldn't pull the brakes because of short things. Yeah, yeah. And then, like you, I thought, but then again, you're running in half the time, so that's what was going on in last night. Right? That's what I was thinking about. Did you. How long did this take? Well, how long does it take to wash up? Right, because I imagine you just being there for, like, all night, probably 25. How long did the little chinese fella dance for in his pants? He's always doing it. Last night he was at it for, like, ten minutes, just. Yeah, and his girlfriend never sits in the same room as him. She's always sat in the bedroom. She's going, you dancing pants again? I go in next door. Well, she was in the bedroom. She's always in the bedroom. Sat on the floor on the mobile phone all the time. Yeah. It's weird how people's lives are just like. It's like that groundhog day thing. It's like, you know, he's jumping about in his underpants. The old woman sat there reading a book. Yeah. And that's what got me thinking about my life. Do you think she ever. Are you sure she's not dead? Every time you look down there, she's just flicking through it. She's just reading this book. The pages never turn. She never seems to finish it. She never moved from her chair. Are you sure? Are you sure the chinese girls are dead around her? I'm going into next door again, that little round Eddie, fellas looking in. He's looking in at me. The bouncer goes, don't worry, love, I'll go and beat him up. But he's always getting ready. That's true. They see you staring at and washing up, going, I could have feet here. And they get scared. The woman's dead. Carl, can you tell us roughly which neighborhood you live in so that we know it's central? Central, is it? Yeah. Wow. Imagine if that little. Was he a chinese fellow, did you say? Yeah. Imagine if he was listening. Now, I'd love him to call in and explain these actions. Well, he might be on some other radio station, talking about a lad who's always washing up and looking at his hands in a mysterious way. But do we have this doctor, this doctor that would go. Well, all right, Carl, I've got. You can either leave him as stumps or I've got every little pair of feet. Why? I mean, I told Jane this and Jane went, is that the only choice? Is he could say, could I have some dead man's hands? Have you got any if you. Where'd you get the feet from? Where'd you get the feet from? Can I have. Can I have put. What would you rather have then, human feet or monkey paws? Well, I mean, that wasn't an option last night. That. If the doctors said. No, it was an option last night. But don't forget, it's in your head, Kyle, this didn't happen. I'm just saying at the time, that's all the doctor had to offer. But, you know, it's your head, you can go anywhere. No, no, no, it wasn't a real doctor to offer. It's in your head. You can go anywhere. You're not trapped. Yeah, but if you can do anything, then you'd say, we'll sort out some other hands. Fair point. Let's play record. Welcome back to this someday. XFM 104.9 Ricky Gervais. Lads, can I just stop you there straight away because the record finished before we'd finished chatting about what we're going to do next. We're going to do Carl's stupid competition again. We're just trying to get the. I think that you. What are the rules? Right, because last week it was a shambles. I know, it was too easy. That's a week before I should. I think people should phone up now and be held in a queue and then he should have the clue otherwise, because people are just phone up with when they know the answer or not. But how is that entertaining to the listener? That's what I'm gonna back at you straight away. I don't think this is entertaining at all. I just think people might want to talk to Carl for just a split second. The way we'll do it, right? Yeah. Right, this is me roll here, right? This is the way we're gonna do it, right? We're gonna say, if you want to win the office on vhs, right, you. Can call it like that. Like it's a Setback prize. There is some. If you get the DVD, there's some special frottage. All right? So it's impressive, right? So they call up now on 8700 801. Two, three, four. Right? Yeah, we like bung on a bit of Elton John in a bit. Right? We line up two callers. That's a beautiful track. Yeah. We line up two callers. Yeah. Right. And then we have them on the air and we say, right, I'm gonna tell you the little story. You've got to tell me what song it is. And they're playing against each other. Well, can they be. Could they be up at the same time then? So I can speak at the same time? But how can they play against each other? Because they haven't got buzzers or. That's the first one. They can say the name. They can shout the name. And it's organized and they got as. Many goes as they want. No, I think they should have one go at a time. And then the other person can have a go. And then they can have another go. Yeah. It's like dueling. It's like dueling. And if they don't win, no one wins this week. We're not giving away prizes willy nilly. Sure. You know, we can give one away next week again. Could, you know, the obvious, not costing us anything because we were, like, involved. As many copies as you want. Seriously. I like it when, like, we got. Them coming out of our. Do you think the listeners are usually in on sort of board meetings like this. Chris? Talent going, hold on. What would they can. They can. What do they vote? A friend. Yeah, they just phone a friend. Look, come down. Okay, look, we haven't got this. We'll have to. We'll play some adverts. Phone up now. Yeah. Right. So that's the plan then. Okay. We're gonna have a beautiful track here continuing our. Wait, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve. Go on. Right. I've said your name five times now. I don't mention at all. Next week. Right. We're gonna play out and John continue in our sort of thing of. Don't. Don't diss them just because they're old and bald now. They used to be good. This is a beautiful track. I dissed him, didn't I? Yeah, called tiny dance. So we enjoy that. Yeah, enjoy that. Enjoy that. And then, if not now, Steve, what were you gonna say? Thanks for asking. I was just gonna say, what should the audience be doing now? If they're listening at home, they want to play the game. What should they be doing, Carl? Should they be. Phone number again. Should be ringing. 0870-0800-1234-0870-0800-1234 and two lucky contestants get to play your game. Yeah. What's the song? What's the song that Carl's thinking? Could I give you a clue when you call up. You've got more chance of playing if you don't sound like a mentalist. Exactly. Most of the people that phone sound a bit like Carl. We're not interested. We don't want those people. Yeah, we want people who can, you know, who are maybe eloquent. Why? You watch me in my pants out on John. Tiny dancer. What a great track. Well, we've got. Well, despite Carl's actions, you should have seen Carl. It was like squiddly diddly. His arms and legs there. He'd have been better with feet, I'll tell you. He didn't know what he was doing. We were getting angry at one point he went, oh, we get a man and a woman and bloke phones up, he goes, are you a bloke? Blokeshe goes, hold on. And then another bloke goes. It goes, are you a bloke? We wanted a woman. He goes, put the woman on. She came on, he went, are you the woman? It's the way you speak to people. So we got on the line. Here's the woman. Hello. Hello. Hi. What's your name? Sarah. Sarah, okay, right, Steve, you want to be rooting for this? Well, I think we should, it seems to me, because you may need some help, because obviously Carl's mind is a vice nest. Yeah, it's a jungle in there. Yeah. So, you know, if you want to call on anyone at any point, maybe you've got some questions you want to just consult or couldn't confer, then I'll be on your side. You're like, she's like. You're like her phone a friend. Exactly. I'm the phone a friend. And ask the audience, who's the bloke? Who's the bloke? It's owen. Owen. Okay. I'll be helping you out should you need any help or clues, as you know, as an insight into carl's mind. I must tell you, though, we don't know what carl's going to come up with now either. No, we keep it real like this. I should just say, for people who've not heard the show before, this is where carl now will tell us a cryptic story. And basically, hidden within that will be a clue to the title of a song. I say cryptic, it's gobbling nonsense. So, okay, then, just to find out who goes first, my lad or your girl, I'm going to toss a coin in my head. Okay, well, ladies first. Ladies first. What was your name again? Sorry? Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. Okay, heads or tails? Heads or tails? Tails. No. Right, my ladder go first. Okay, so. So what this means is when he's finished the. The cryptic clue, you, Owen, will get to guess first. But if you get it wrong, it goes over to Sarah and then back and forth until one, hopefully one of you, gets it right. Okay, we could be here for some time. Yeah. And what. What we playing for here? A DVD or video of the office? Whatever we can. Whatever you ever format you've got. Yeah. Okay, then. Okay, Carl, go. Right, so here we go. So it's the name of a song we're looking for. Brilliant. Right. This bloke, is that a. He's had a good night out at the pub. This is probably all irrelevant. Remember that, Owen. This could all be irrelevant. Yeah. Okay, right. So he's had a good night out with his mates and that and surely enjoyed himself. And he's only on his way home and it's just like any. Any ordinary night, right? Everything's just normally seeing the same people leaving. Leaving the pub, going home. And he's like, see you, you know, see you tomorrow night. I'll be out tomorrow. 730 and what have you and. And they're on the way home and it's nice night. Everything's. Everything's nice. And he's walking home and he sees this sort of. Sort of smoke coming out of the grid, right? Some smoke coming out of a grid. Yeah, smoke. He thinks, what's that? All right? And this is what's weird because it's like any other normal night, but this time the smoke coming out the grid and he goes over to it and he can hear some moaning, right? It's like, oh. So he. He thinks this isn't right. So he stands over the grid and he's looking down and he can't see anything. So he lifts the grid up, right? Do you mean a grill? No, a grid. You know, like a grid in the street. Yeah, he needs a grill. A grill. Okay. Okay. And he lifts it off and he's looking in and like, more smoke's coming out and he can hear the moaning getting louder. And then this little demon pops his head out, right? And he goes, are you alright? Yeah. And the little demon goes, oh, I'm hurting. And he goes, what do you mean you're hurting? He said, oh, it's dead hot down there, you know? And it's weird because he works out that it's like come from hell. Yes. And it's going, oh, I'm all hot and burning. All his skin sort of really red raw because of all the flames in hell. And stuff. So he goes, oh, he said, I tell you what, I'll take you to the doctors. And the little demon's like, what, you'll do that for me? And he goes, yeah, I'll do that. And he text him to the doctors. What's the song? That was Ricky Gervais, next FM. It's 03:00 now. We're going over to Natasha. Thanks very much, see you next week. Bye. Man along. That was quite a long story. Is Owen and Sarah still there? Yeah. Have you dozed off? You still with us? Okay, Owen, any clues? No, not yet. I haven't got, I have no idea. Can I think out loud with Owen, do you think? No, I think Owen needs to at. Least have a guess before another guess. Owen, smoke on the water. Well, it's not, is it? So, okay, over. Sarah, what do you think? It's a good guess. No, it's not right. Not right. Right. Carl, you'd have to give him a little clue. Um, well, think about the little fella. Think about the little demon. Yeah. Okay, there's the clue. Brilliant. Thanks for that. Where did I say you came from? Highway to hell. On the right. Along the right lines, but not the right song. But Sarah. Stay away to heaven. Carl, if this is rubbish, I'm never working with you again. If this doesn't work. What do you mean if this is rubbish? Right, okay, take it. Take the main bit of the story. What's happening? It took 30 minutes. The grid is the grid. We got the grid. The smoke. What's he doing? How did the story end? He went to the doctor. He went to the doctor? Who did? He said to the doctor, it's a little demon fella. Why did he do that? Sarah, come on, that's a big clue, right? Why did. Sarah, come on, let's think about this. Why would he take a little burnt demon? He was burnt, wasn't he's from hell. All the flames and that and all the skin was really raw and he's like, he was moaning in pain. And the little fella goes, yeah, I am on the way home. My tea's gonna be in the oven and everything, but do you know what? I'm gonna take you to the doctors and sort you out sick. Don't. Just. Is there anyone you've got there in the house who could maybe help you, like a sort of eight year old child? Yeah. Yeah, an alien. Yeah. Um, I've got a three month old baby. He probably talks more sense. Yeah. Not the new then car, we mean. Um, right, well, I'll tell you what. Let'S play a record. But these all have a chance. Poor people have got lives. Sure they're. Oh, yeah, like we haven't. No, but I know, Carl, this is. There's so many things I could be doing instead of this, Rick. I know, but Carl, we'll play some ads, right? They can't stay on the line. They've got three minutes. They're playing for a video here. They've got three minutes to think about it. Is that all right with you? Okay, yeah. Is that all right, Owen? Yep. Sorted. XFM. Right, please try and guess this because Carl's threatening to roll over to next week. Oh, I know. I don't want to live a week trying to think of a little burnt devil in a greedy, as he calls it. Devil in a grid. Devil in a devil in a grid. Smokey, Smokey. Devil. Devil. Oh, God. Burnt devil. Grid. Sarah and grid. What's a grid? And he means a grill. He means the little thing in the. In the smoke. Burn the water. Barbecue to doctor. Burn. Doctor. Owen, any. Any ideas? Devil without a cause by kid rock. No, what we're gonna is the words devil, right? So devil's a key word here and. You'Re thinking about what the blokes. What's the bloke done? He's took him several years. Why? Why did he do that? Why didn't he just say, oh, yeah, it looks terrible, but I've got to get off home. He's a good samaritan. Samaritan. He's a good guy. He's a. He's a good guy. Savior. Devil. Save you, Devil, for later. We're really running out. I've got it. I've got it. Have you really, Sarah, I tell you this, love, you are. You have got something to entertain yourself with in about three weeks time, when we get the DVD's and videos through. Ladies, gentlemen, I give you sympathy for the devil. Sympathy for the devil. Man alive. It's rubbish. That's not a cryptic clue. It's not rubbish. Sympathy for the devil. You said he wasn't the devil. He said he was a demon. Right, okay. Sympathy for. What's all that rubbish about him being burned and taken to hospital? Sorry, Rick, but I'm noting a little whiff of jealousy. There's so rubbish. No, I'm sorry, but Sarah is happy. She's not allowed to try and make people. Her baby is happy. Sarah, her husband. Or maybe part of married. Maybe they're living in sin. She is also happy. They're happy. That household is happy. Oh, in devastated. Yeah. Oh. On DVD or video? DVD, please. DVD. Sarah, thank you very much indeed for playing. Oh, sorry, Owen. Yeah. Triumphant. Another triumphant rubbish. Carl, you are so rubbish. There, you got it right. Oh, dear. Here. Rubbish. Well done. Jealous, jealous. I love rubbish. I thought it was great one I've been watching.",
