<p>By default terms will be matched using the broadest possible search. e.g.  <span class="keyword">man alive</span> will
  match any line of dialog that contains either <span class="keyword">man</span> or <span class="keyword">alive</span> (or both).</p>
<strong>Exact Matches</strong>
<p>To exactly match a section of text, wrap it in double quotes e.g. <span class="keyword">"man alive"</span></p>

<strong>Filter by Speaker</strong>
<p>To limit the search to a specific speaker you can add a <span class="keyword">&#64;</span> e.g. <span class="keyword"> man alive &#64;steve</span>.<br/>
  When speakers contain multiple words they must be quoted e.g. <span class="keyword">&#64;"ricky and steve"</span> but if single words you can omit the quotes.</p>

<strong>Filter by Publication</strong>
<p>To limit the search to a specific publication you can add a <span class="keyword">~</span> e.g. <span class="keyword"> man alive ~xfm</span></p>

<strong>Mixing conditions</strong>
<p>You can also mix all these options in a single search e.g. <span class="keyword">&#64;karl ~xfm "plugger" co-management</span>. This is useful
  for when you know the gist of a quote, but cannot remember the exact structure.</p>
<p>To get the best result it helps to <strong>put exact (quoted) terms first</strong> (e.g. "plugger") since this improves autocomplete accuracy for the more vague terms.</p>

<strong>Autocomplete</strong>
<p>Autocomplete will respect any filters that have already been added e.g.<span class="keyword">&#64;rob</span> will only auto-complete lines like "the thing is, with a student, you're learning".
So in general you're better off putting filters in first, before terms.</p>
