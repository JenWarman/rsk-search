          <h4 class="mb-2">What do I do?</h4>
          <p>What you are looking at is a auto-transcription of about 3 minutes of audio. Some parts may be correct but
            others will be wrong. Mixed in with the audio
            are <span class="code">#OFFSET</span> markers. These indicate the number of seconds elapsed since the start
            of the episode, and should not be
            edited or added.</p>
          <p>The objective is to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Split each line so that it accurately reflects the audio (including a prefix to indicate who is speaking
              e.g. <span class="code">karl:</span>)
            </li>
            <li>Correct the text of any line was not transcribed accurately.</li>
            <li>Add additional non-speeech information e.g. <span class="code">ricky laughs</span></li>
          </ol>

          <p>IMPORTANT: Try and keep the <span class="code">#OFFSET</span> tags as close to the
            following word as possible. If the offsets are accurate it would allow the specific audio
            to be available for each ~30 second segment.</p>

          <h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Songs</h4>
          <p>To indicate a song was played you can use the speaker prefix <span class="code">song:</span> for example
            <span class="code">song: Feeder - Come Back Around</span></p>

          <h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Summarising multiple-lines</h4>
          <p>There is another special <span class="code">#SYN:</span> tag, similar to <span class="code">#OFFSET</span>
            you can use to summarise several lines. For example</p>
          <pre>
karl: (twaddle)\n
...\n
#SYN: ricky gets a real bow and arrow!
ricky: Crazy bait blur. All right on Xfm. 104.9 really? Yeah, so I also got a Jane got me a few nice presents including my favorite of all of them a real bow and arrow a real bow and arrow!
steve: Yeah, right and what you, you're going to rob from the rich and give to the poor.
ricky: yeah
...
#/SYN
karl: I used to have a rifle as a kid...
...
          </pre>
          <p>These will not be shown in the text currently, but they are useful to have.</p>

          <h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">What will happen next?</h4>
          <p>Once a chunk has been submitted it will be reviewed and if it is valid and mostly correct it will be merged
            into
            the raw data file for the episode. This will then become visible in the corresponding episode page after the
            next release.</p>

          <h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Who owns my work?</h4>
          <p>Once the content has been merged and becomes available in the github repository I consider it fair game
            for anyone that wishes to copy, modify or share it. I do not claim any kind of ownership over this content
            and am
            providing services to maintain it for my own enjoyment, not as a way to benefit financially or otherwise
            from
            the content.</p>

          <h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Will I be attributed for my contribution?</h4>
          <p>Yes I will try and maintain an accurate list of contributors.</p>

          <h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">I have another question or complaint!</h4>
          <p>OK open an issue here: <a href="https://github.com/warmans/rsk-search/issues" target="_blank">https://github.com/warmans/rsk-search/issues</a>
