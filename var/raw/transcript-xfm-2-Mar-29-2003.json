But from what I understand, the reason that it was so outrageous is because it has a whole sequence which shows what it would be like if Jesus had lived his life and not martyred himself on the cross. But lived his life as a human being, part of which is, you know, having sex and, uh, so I think that was chiefly what the outrage was. That it was showing this godly man to be, you know, a human as he was supposedly. 'Cause he was supposed to be human, as well. So, uh, so that's the reason. That's the reason there was complaints there, I don't know, I haven't seen the film,"
