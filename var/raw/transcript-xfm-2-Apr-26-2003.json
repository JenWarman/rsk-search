It looks like he’s had um, his big toes put on his hands.Steve:Does he have to drink a pint with two hands?Ricky:Yeah, yeah, and he’s, he’s dropping stuff all the time.Steve:Can I just go back to the ‘Rule Of Thumb’ thing though. The idea of, what date was this? I’m not asking Karl, I’m looking at Ricky ‘cos you’re not going to have any idea Karl, it’s just going to be ‘The Past’.Ricky:Yeah.Steve:But I like the idea that…Ricky:I think it’s the same sort of day where, I dunno, you c…i….you got hung for being homosexual and you could shoot a Welshman.Steve:But I like the idea that there’s people, there’s blokes  beating their wives  with shovels, blocks of wood and someone’s gone “Hang on a minute everyone this is crazy!”Ricky:”Hold on, wait a minute, let’s have a look at your thumbs. What can we do?”Steve:”Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, we’ve got to have some kind of rule here. I’m all for beating your wife but let’s have some kind of rule, let’s give them a sporting chance, surely?”Ricky:Yeah, he goes “What, I tell you what, what about you can hit her with the width of your thumb?” and the wife goes “Make it the width of his knob.”Steve laughsRicky:I go “No!”Steve:He slaps her again.Ricky:Yeah, yeah, “Width of your thumb, alright?” ‘SSSSSSCHCUW’ “Better?” “Yeah.”Steve:It’s like the em, it’s like the, seeing in the swimming baths they used to be those signs that would say um, ‘No Running’, ‘No Jumping’Ricky:Yeah.Steve:That makes sense, ‘No Bombing’, fair enough. Um, ‘No Petting’.Ricky:’No Petting.’Steve:It’s like you’re not allowed to kiss in a swimming baths.Ricky \u0026 Karl:Yeah…Steve:And I love the idea it’s probably some kind of lifeguard who’s sort of, maybe saw his ex-girlfriend getting off with some bloke in the water and thought “Oh, bloody hell! Right there’s no petting anymore in here!”Ricky:”What d’you mean?”Steve:”No petting, you can’t, you’re not allowed to kiss. Her.

D’you know what I mean? ‘Oh who’s your mate Tourettes Boy?’ ‘Holy Fuk.’ You’d have been annoyed wouldn’t you?Steve:Is that a character from Lenny Henry’s show?Ricky chucklesRicky:I can’t remember if it’s Chris Moyles or Lenny Henry.Steve:Yeah, one of ‘em. Anyway the winner, lucky old Richard Perks from Birmingham. He’s listening presumably on Sky and so, nice to have him listening, and that’s Richard Perks he got the answers, all of them right, in fact most people seemed to get Terence Trent D’arby, or Tourettes Trent Derby.Ricky:Well I think that’s offensive, erm, if you want to complain, erm, what’s the number, what, who’d they write to to complain about that, you er, using that as a…Karl:The same person you told people to write to and tell ‘em I was a knobhead and shouldn’t be on the radio.Ricky bursts into laughterKarl:La,last week when I was away.Ricky:Did anyone do it?Karl:I think a few went through it yeah.Ricky:Did you listen to the show?Karl:I, I listened back to the recording yeah.Ricky:Did you get any e-mails before you listened to the show?Karl:Yeah when I got in.Ricky:Did it upset you? What sort of things was it?Karl:Just stuff, er, I can’t remember just, ah, it was weird  because there was like a few of ‘em in a row and I just thought “What’s that, what’s happened here?”Ricky:Yeah.Steve:I love, ‘cos we, we said that, yeah you weren’t here so, so what, what did you say?Ricky:I just said, er, phone in, um, we had a couple of genuine e-mails that liked the show, didn’t they?Steve:Yeah.Ricky:And I said phone in, and, er, um leave a message or e-mail Andrew Phillips and Karl Pilkington and just say the show was great, the show was brilliant without him. But they went a bit too far did they? What did they say then?Karl:Ohh I can’t remember, and it doesn’t bother me ‘cos I’m not bothered what people say, am I.Ricky:No.Karl:D’you know what I mean?Ricky:No. You don’t care, you don’t care what YOU say to people either. Poor little Robin, he looked crushed.Karl:Oh whatever.Ricky:Whatever?Karl:Well it doesn’t matter because he’s, he’s doing well at what he does!Ricky:He couldn’t even hitchhike home ‘cos they wouldn’t stop ‘cos his thumbs didn’t show up.Karl:He earns…Ricky:He was waiting there for ages by the side of the road.Steve:Do you know the difficulty he has buying gloves?Ricky cackles awaySteve:It’s murder for him.Ricky:Ye…he wears little oven gloves.Steve:Yeah.Ricky:From like Wendy Houses. He, er, he has to wear Barbie oven gloves.Steve:Yeah.Ricky:Aww.Karl:Right, so, er, yeah so they winner then, Richard Perks in Birmginham if you could just e-mail in with your address.Ricky:There was another winner wasn’t there, um, what was his name? We..wh…is…Steve:One, one person who got all the right answers and was almost a winner but his name was Peter Kay.Ricky:And I like, I like Peter Kay to come in second, so we gave it to Richard Perks.Steve:Yep.Ricky gigglesSteve:Peter Kay…never gonna win.Ricky:Play a record.Song:Radiohead – “There There”I'd Like a Severe BlowRicky:Radiohead. ‘There There’. XFM 104.9, rejoin Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington. Right, Rockbusters. Well you’ve blo…you shot yourself in the foot with that, so, er…Tourettes Trent Derby?Steve:Amazing.Ricky:I mean…what did you think of first? His name and what words you could put in there?Karl:Er,  I normally sort of just go through a Guinness Book of Hit Singles and go “Right who can I do?”Ricky:Right. You’re giving away a lot of, I mean that, I mean you’re an enigma Karl, I wouldn’t give away your workings. I mean, ‘cos everyone, then everyone’ll be able to do it. And what, and what you’ve got now is a gift that people can’t really tap into.Karl:Mm.Ricky:Do you know what I mean? See that's what Lenny Henry and um, Chris Moyles's mistake. See I've sort of worked out how they do their comedy and I'm doing it now.Steve:Hm. Sure.Ricky:Do you see what I mean? Now that I'm, y'know I'm, I'm doing c...Steve:I mean, I think the only way that people would start to be able to replicate a lot of what Karl does is maybe they had a severe blow to the head or they were diving and they came up to the surface too quickly.Ricky:Ding dong! ‘Ooooh I’d like a severe blow!’ Oh, get lost Gayvid!Ricky giggles.Steve laughs.Steve:Ohh let’s have some adverts quick.Karl cuts to adverts.Talkin' of Weird Heads and StuffSong:Steely Dan – ‘Reeling In The Years’Ricky:Steely Dan. ‘Reeling In The Years’Steve coughs hard.Steve:Sorry about that.Ricky:Look, look he’s gone to put on his little duffel coat.Steve:Yep.
