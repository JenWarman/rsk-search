He was goin’ \"I’ve just got a feelin’ about those\", I went 'Sure'.  He went \"Although, you know, m’ girlfriend  said that if I won the lottery, we’d prob’ly split up, ‘cause we like such different things.\"   Mean’, she likes to travel, and he doesn’t, and so he says, he said, \"So what I said was, well if I win then I won’t tell ya.
