Then I laid on the bathroom floor, and Jane timed it, it was 45 minutes of me singing ”Right By Your Side“ by the Eurythmics. And then I went to bed, and apparently, I got up in the middle of the night, walked around the bed, and just thought the bed was a toilet. And Jane said ”Ricky!“ I went ”What?!“ She went ”You’re pissing on me!“ ”What?! Well no need to wake me up!“ And then just got back to bed."

And I was driving back, it was quite late, it was about sort of 7 or 8, and I was drivin’ back, and I pulled in to get some petrol, we had to fill up the car every day.  And I went into this garage to fill up some petrol and I was there, and this blokes, two blokes came in a white van, right?  They sort of pulled in the four court and I was fillin’ up the car.  And they went, Ayyy.  D’ya’ wanna buy a coupla speakers?  And I said:  Yes I do!"
