Urr let me see, this is from Lee Matthews by the look of it, he says I li- he lives in a surburban area, where the local teenagers also live on the same road, and they're running riot: they're smashing wing mirrors off the cars, they're crashing into parked cars on their skateboards, and they're just generally making hay- mayhem, you know night and day. Urr what can he do to stop this going on? The parent's to the kids don't seem to give a damn; anyone who complains to them they just say \"oh, piss of\", you know the police are useless cos they never catch them in the actual act of violence which is what they've got to do to urr- apparently convict them, so they urr- they don't know who to turn to really.
