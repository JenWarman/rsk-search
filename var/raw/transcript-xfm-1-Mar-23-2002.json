And it’s a bit tired now, he chucks sticks for it and it doesn’t, it doesn’t go for it.  And uh, he’s sayin’ to his mam, \"Oh, I want a new dog, ‘cause this one’s useless, it doesn’t do what, you know, it doesn’t have any fun with me\",\t \"Aw, no, y’know, Rover’s a good little dog, you should look after it\", and he’s like \"Aw, I want a new one.\"  So they buy him a new puppy, and it’s runnin’ around, yappin’ about, and he’s playin’ with it, in the grass, and then uh, one day, he goes to the park and he’s messin’ about and rollin’ about with it, and he falls into the lake, all right, and the little puppy’s, like yelpin’ at him, and he’s goin’, \"Help me, help me!\" the little dog’s yappin’, and then the old dog comes, and gets his collar, and it pulls him out of the lake.  And he goes, \"Oh, God, y’know, why did I forget about you, you’re the better dog\", and he loved that one again rather than the puppy."
