Anyway the winner, lucky old Richard Perks from Birmingham. He’s listening presumably on Sky and so, nice to have him listening, and that’s Richard Perks he got the answers, all of them right, in fact most people seemed to get Terence Trent D’arby, or Tourettes Trent Derby.Ricky:Well I think that’s offensive, erm, if you want to complain, erm, what’s the number, what, who’d they write to to complain about that, you er, using that as a…Karl:The same person you told people to write to and tell ‘em I was a knobhead and shouldn’t be on the radio.Ricky bursts into laughterKarl:La,last week when I was away.Ricky:Did anyone do it?Karl:I think a few went through it yeah.Ricky:Did you listen to the show?Karl:I, I listened back to the recording yeah.Ricky:Did you get any e-mails before you listened to the show?Karl:Yeah when I got in.Ricky:Did it upset you? What sort of things was it?Karl:Just stuff, er, I can’t remember just, ah, it was weird  because there was like a few of ‘em in a row and I just thought “What’s that, what’s happened here?”Ricky:Yeah.Steve:I love, ‘cos we, we said that, yeah you weren’t here so, so what, what did you say?Ricky:I just said, er, phone in, um, we had a couple of genuine e-mails that liked the show, didn’t they?Steve:Yeah.Ricky:And I said phone in, and, er, um leave a message or e-mail Andrew Phillips and Karl Pilkington and just say the show was great, the show was brilliant without him. But they went a bit too far did they? What did they say then?Karl:Ohh I can’t remember, and it doesn’t bother me ‘cos I’m not bothered what people say, am I.Ricky:No.Karl:D’you know what I mean?Ricky:No. You don’t care, you don’t care what YOU say to people either. Poor little Robin, he looked crushed.Karl:Oh whatever.Ricky:Whatever?Karl:Well it doesn’t matter because he’s, he’s doing well at what he does!Ricky:He couldn’t even hitchhike home ‘cos they wouldn’t stop ‘cos his thumbs didn’t show up.Karl:He earns…Ricky:He was waiting there for ages by the side of the road.Steve:Do you know the difficulty he has buying gloves?Ricky cackles awaySteve:It’s murder for him.Ricky:Ye…he wears little oven gloves.Steve:Yeah.Ricky:From like Wendy Houses.

We..wh…is…Steve:One, one person who got all the right answers and was almost a winner but his name was Peter Kay.Ricky:And I like, I like Peter Kay to come in second, so we gave it to Richard Perks.Steve:Yep.Ricky gigglesSteve:Peter Kay…never gonna win.Ricky:Play a record.Song:Radiohead – “There There”I'd Like a Severe BlowRicky:Radiohead. ‘There There’. XFM 104.9, rejoin Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington. Right, Rockbusters. Well you’ve blo…you shot yourself in the foot with that, so, er…Tourettes Trent Derby?Steve:Amazing.Ricky:I mean…what did you think of first? His name and what words you could put in there?Karl:Er,  I normally sort of just go through a Guinness Book of Hit Singles and go “Right who can I do?”Ricky:Right. You’re giving away a lot of, I mean that, I mean you’re an enigma Karl, I wouldn’t give away your workings. I mean, ‘cos everyone, then everyone’ll be able to do it. And what, and what you’ve got now is a gift that people can’t really tap into.Karl:Mm.Ricky:Do you know what I mean? See that's what Lenny Henry and um, Chris Moyles's mistake. See I've sort of worked out how they do their comedy and I'm doing it now.Steve:Hm. Sure.Ricky:Do you see what I mean? Now that I'm, y'know I'm, I'm doing c...Steve:I mean, I think the only way that people would start to be able to replicate a lot of what Karl does is maybe they had a severe blow to the head or they were diving and they came up to the surface too quickly.Ricky:Ding dong! ‘Ooooh I’d like a severe blow!’ Oh, get lost Gayvid!Ricky giggles.Steve laughs.Steve:Ohh let’s have some adverts quick.Karl cuts to adverts.Talkin' of Weird Heads and StuffSong:Steely Dan – ‘Reeling In The Years’Ricky:Steely Dan. ‘Reeling In The Years’Steve coughs hard.Steve:Sorry about that.Ricky:Look, look he’s gone to put on his little duffel coat.Steve:Yep.
