We got the coach, coming back from Paris to one of the ferries, one of the ports, Calais or wherever it was. Coach trip, that's quite a long coach trip, and at one point we were thinking \"this is odd, we're on the motorway, we're making good progress\". Suddenly, we came off the motorway, we must have gone, like, forty minutes out of our way, ended up in this street, completely empty, little French town. And er, pull up outside this, what appears to be a restaurant, and a guy jumps on dressed as a, like a Butlins redcoat. He's French, but he's putting on a kind of English accent. He goes \"'Ello, er, thank you very much. Top of the morning, good morning, hello. Erm, come in, we've got food, drink, eh? Go upstairs, we've got rooms if you want to have a rest, eh, or play around. No? It's up to you\". And er, we all had to funnel off this thing into this restaurant, and this one family went \"Well we don't want to go in the restaurant, we've brought sandwiches, we just want to get to the port, we're not interested\". And they said \"Well you've got to come in the restaurant\". They went \"well we don't want to come in the restaurant\". So the guy said \"well I'll have to lock you in the coach\". So this family were locked in the coach while we all traipsed off in. I could just look-I looked back and just saw this kid with his face pressed up against the glass."
